00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:16.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Why did I want to direct
a WWDC opening number?

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:18.946 A:middle
Good question.

00:00:19.546 --> 00:00:21.566 A:middle
You know, I think I've always
been attracted to risk.

00:00:21.916 --> 00:00:26.386 A:middle
You know? When I shared my
vision for the number, I --

00:00:26.386 --> 00:00:30.796 A:middle
you know, they said this is
just a developers conference.

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:32.816 A:middle
You know? You don't
need to overthink it.

00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:37.896 A:middle
But I always feel that my job as
a director is to push an idea.

00:00:38.736 --> 00:00:39.156 A:middle
What's that?

00:00:39.676 --> 00:00:40.406 A:middle
Am I a genius?

00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:41.146 A:middle
I don't know.

00:00:41.246 --> 00:00:41.416 A:middle
What!

00:00:41.886 --> 00:00:42.246 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hey, David.

00:00:42.246 --> 00:00:43.096 A:middle
Are you ready for
the walkthrough?

00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:43.676 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:44.596 --> 00:00:46.336 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Who are you talking
to in here?

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:47.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; No one.

00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.106 A:middle
&gt;&gt; You were talking to somebody.

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.006 A:middle
Unless you were talking
to yourself.

00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:53.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I have been working on this
new app called Work Crush.

00:00:53.536 --> 00:00:55.806 A:middle
It's for people who have crushes
on their workmates and want

00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:57.156 A:middle
to know when they are nearby.

00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:01.416 A:middle
It's not for me, but
-- oh, oh, hi, David.

It's not for me, but
-- oh, oh, hi, David.

00:01:01.416 --> 00:01:02.936 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I thought you were
supposed to be guarding my door.

00:01:02.936 --> 00:01:03.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Which one is your door?

00:01:04.736 --> 00:01:06.346 A:middle
&gt;&gt; This is Rick.

00:01:06.576 --> 00:01:07.116 A:middle
Rick, look at me.

00:01:07.576 --> 00:01:08.506 A:middle
I need you angry in there, Rick.

00:01:08.616 --> 00:01:10.686 A:middle
I need you angry, angry, angry!

00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:11.546 A:middle
Yeah!

00:01:12.396 --> 00:01:14.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Did you get that email
about my email not working?

00:01:14.236 --> 00:01:14.546 A:middle
&gt;&gt; No.

00:01:14.546 --> 00:01:15.546 A:middle
&gt;&gt; What? No, no, no.

00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:18.166 A:middle
It needs to be more
like, you know, Pshhhh!

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:20.286 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, he means bigger.

00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:21.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Bigger, bigger, yeah,
like developers are on fire!

00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:23.026 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Which iPhone do you want

00:01:23.026 --> 00:01:23.976 A:middle
for the main character,
silver or gold?

00:01:24.086 --> 00:01:25.016 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Can I see silver?

00:01:25.016 --> 00:01:25.956 A:middle
Okay. Can I see gold?

00:01:26.216 --> 00:01:26.446 A:middle
Okay.

00:01:30.226 --> 00:01:31.946 A:middle
I can't tell because
the reflection

00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:32.806 A:middle
of the flame is on it.

00:01:32.806 --> 00:01:34.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Can you decide this later?

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:37.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, he is right.

00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:38.046 A:middle
Let's decide it later.

00:01:38.046 --> 00:01:39.346 A:middle
&gt;&gt; We'll take the gold.

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:42.726 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Got to choose a talent
for the dating app number.

00:01:42.956 --> 00:01:44.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yes. No.

00:01:45.016 --> 00:01:46.736 A:middle
Yes. No. Yeah.

00:01:47.236 --> 00:01:48.366 A:middle
The pretty one.

00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:48.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That's you.

00:01:49.056 --> 00:01:50.626 A:middle

00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:51.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:52.496 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Oh, my gosh!

00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:53.856 A:middle
That's my coffee.

00:01:54.306 --> 00:01:54.386 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:55.776 --> 00:01:56.386 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Ahhh! Oh, cool.

00:01:57.366 --> 00:01:58.616 A:middle
Oh, that's awesome.

Who are these guys?

00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:06.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The Tim Cook-alikes
you asked for.

00:02:07.406 --> 00:02:08.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Oh, right.

You guys are good

00:02:12.946 --> 00:02:13.266 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:02:13.726 --> 00:02:16.726 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hey, you guys are
the faces of WWDC.

00:02:16.726 --> 00:02:18.016 A:middle
Let's go. Not the real faces.

00:02:19.016 --> 00:02:21.606 A:middle
You are the masks
that they give you.

00:02:21.606 --> 00:02:21.966 A:middle
What's this?

00:02:22.716 --> 00:02:23.386 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Goat Simulator.

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:24.486 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Goat Simulator.

00:02:24.486 --> 00:02:26.476 A:middle
I am not feeling it.

00:02:26.476 --> 00:02:27.426 A:middle
Kill it. Oh, that's an ax.

00:02:27.496 --> 00:02:29.076 A:middle
No, no, don't actually kill it.

00:02:29.496 --> 00:02:31.596 A:middle
Okay? There he is.

00:02:31.746 --> 00:02:31.956 A:middle
Hey.

00:02:32.046 --> 00:02:33.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; David, what have
you got me into here?

00:02:33.976 --> 00:02:35.456 A:middle
Am I like a Victoria's
Secret guy?

00:02:35.546 --> 00:02:36.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; You are an angel investor.

00:02:36.916 --> 00:02:39.766 A:middle
You make millions
off kids' dreams.

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:41.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So I am just a rich guy?

00:02:41.236 --> 00:02:42.126 A:middle
&gt;&gt; You are a rich guy.

00:02:42.626 --> 00:02:44.516 A:middle
Bring him up.

00:02:45.146 --> 00:02:46.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Ooh, this harness cuts the
circulation off in my legs.

00:02:47.046 --> 00:02:48.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That's all right, buddy.

00:02:48.776 --> 00:02:48.956 A:middle
No worries.

00:02:55.846 --> 00:02:56.596 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let's run it.

00:02:56.596 --> 00:02:58.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; No, I say when we run it.

00:02:58.866 --> 00:02:59.146 A:middle
Who is it?

00:02:59.186 --> 00:02:59.926 A:middle
Why is he saying my words?

00:03:07.346 --> 00:03:11.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So many days of dev time,
haven't seen a ray of sunshine.

00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:14.196 A:middle
Locked in my coding lair.

00:03:14.196 --> 00:03:17.976 A:middle
It's been days since I
changed my underwear.

00:03:18.246 --> 00:03:19.896 A:middle
My app is in the Store?

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:21.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Your app is in the Store.

00:03:22.066 --> 00:03:24.006 A:middle
&gt;&gt; From the whiteboard
to the App Store

00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:25.886 A:middle
because when I code,
I'm swift, boy.

00:03:26.096 --> 00:03:28.976 A:middle
Yeah, I rule Objective-C,
objective one, objective me.

00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:30.016 A:middle
See the app, I made that.

00:03:30.116 --> 00:03:30.976 A:middle
Download my game, you play that.

00:03:31.046 --> 00:03:33.146 A:middle
App of the day, now
I'm worldwide.

00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:34.596 A:middle
Five stars, now watch me shine.

00:03:35.416 --> 00:03:36.346 A:middle
You made the cut.

00:03:36.686 --> 00:03:37.466 A:middle
The world is yours.

00:03:38.046 --> 00:03:40.846 A:middle
Now that your app
is in the Store.

00:03:41.396 --> 00:03:43.736 A:middle
This is your break,
your time to fly.

00:03:44.146 --> 00:03:47.586 A:middle
So raise your hands
up and touch the sky.

00:03:56.156 --> 00:03:56.446 A:middle
&gt;&gt; What happened?

00:03:56.536 --> 00:03:57.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The generator's blown.

00:03:58.106 --> 00:03:58.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Dammit!

00:03:58.496 --> 00:04:00.936 A:middle
Can I at least get a work light?

Can I at least get a work light?

00:04:03.866 --> 00:04:04.346 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Rebooting.

00:04:07.076 --> 00:04:08.446 A:middle
&gt;&gt; How long until
we're up and running?

00:04:08.996 --> 00:04:09.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:10.926 A:middle
Maybe 24 hours.

00:04:11.486 --> 00:04:12.606 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, what am I
supposed to do with this?

00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:14.016 A:middle
Guys, we go live tomorrow.

00:04:14.016 --> 00:04:15.726 A:middle
That's just a bottle
of water and a laptop.

00:04:15.726 --> 00:04:17.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:04:17.046 --> 00:04:18.706 A:middle
I think it's kind of pretty.

00:04:20.516 --> 00:04:26.816 A:middle
[Music]

00:04:27.316 --> 00:04:27.546 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:04:27.546 --> 00:04:28.256 A:middle
We'll work with it.

00:04:29.196 --> 00:04:30.726 A:middle
[Laughter] I tell you
what, though, whoever walks

00:04:30.726 --> 00:04:32.456 A:middle
out there better have something
pretty incredible to say.

00:04:33.456 --> 00:04:35.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's just hope
he doesn't get booed.

00:04:36.126 --> 00:04:37.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Either way, we are getting
free watches out of it.

00:04:38.016 --> 00:04:40.016 A:middle

Thanks for joining us.

00:05:06.046 --> 00:05:07.726 A:middle
And welcome to San Francisco.

00:05:07.726 --> 00:05:11.096 A:middle
Welcome to WWDC 2015.

00:05:11.706 --> 00:05:14.376 A:middle
Although we may not
have any -- thank you --

00:05:14.786 --> 00:05:18.596 A:middle
high-flying trapeze acts, we
do have a lot of great things

00:05:18.596 --> 00:05:19.856 A:middle
to talk about this morning.

00:05:20.596 --> 00:05:23.906 A:middle
This developer conference
continues to be the epicenter

00:05:23.906 --> 00:05:27.786 A:middle
of change for not only
Apple, but the industry.

00:05:28.976 --> 00:05:32.346 A:middle
This is our 26th WWDC.

00:05:32.346 --> 00:05:35.576 A:middle
We have attendees today
from over 70 countries,

00:05:35.956 --> 00:05:38.766 A:middle
and 80 percent are here
for the very first time.

00:05:39.516 --> 00:05:44.566 A:middle
[Applause]

00:05:45.066 --> 00:05:48.286 A:middle
This is our most
global conference ever.

00:05:49.276 --> 00:05:53.766 A:middle
And a special shout-out for
our 350 scholarship winners.

00:05:54.516 --> 00:06:01.476 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

[Cheers and applause]

00:06:01.976 --> 00:06:03.936 A:middle
These guys are unbelievable.

00:06:03.936 --> 00:06:05.546 A:middle
I spent some time
with them yesterday.

00:06:05.546 --> 00:06:09.416 A:middle
Our youngest scholarship
winner is a 12-year-old girl

00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:10.286 A:middle
from New York.

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:13.426 A:middle
She is going to have a
fantastic future ahead.

00:06:14.016 --> 00:06:16.006 A:middle
[Applause]

00:06:16.006 --> 00:06:18.516 A:middle
We've got over a hundred
sessions planned for you

00:06:18.516 --> 00:06:21.526 A:middle
and over 150 labs so that
you can get your hands

00:06:21.526 --> 00:06:23.176 A:middle
on our latest technologies.

00:06:24.136 --> 00:06:27.706 A:middle
And we've got over a thousand
Apple engineers to answer just

00:06:27.706 --> 00:06:29.586 A:middle
about any question
that you might have.

00:06:30.806 --> 00:06:32.696 A:middle
Now, we've got a lot more
people that would have liked

00:06:32.696 --> 00:06:34.996 A:middle
to have been here this
morning, but unfortunately,

00:06:34.996 --> 00:06:37.806 A:middle
we just can't fit any
more in, as you can tell.

00:06:38.876 --> 00:06:40.366 A:middle
And so for the first time,

00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:43.176 A:middle
we're not only live
streaming the Keynote,

00:06:43.566 --> 00:06:45.946 A:middle
but we are live streaming
30 sessions

00:06:45.946 --> 00:06:47.256 A:middle
of the conference as well.

00:06:48.516 --> 00:06:53.876 A:middle
[Applause]

00:06:54.376 --> 00:06:57.726 A:middle
Now, before we get right to
the show, I'd like to bring

00:06:57.726 --> 00:07:00.686 A:middle
up something that I saw on
the news just a few days ago.

This is Brandon Moss of

00:07:03.796 --> 00:07:08.106 A:middle
and he hit his 100th career
home run last Tuesday.

00:07:08.746 --> 00:07:10.896 A:middle
Obviously, it's a huge milestone
if you are a baseball player.

00:07:10.896 --> 00:07:12.576 A:middle
Not a lot of people do this.

00:07:13.146 --> 00:07:15.156 A:middle
And you can imagine how much

00:07:15.156 --> 00:07:17.376 A:middle
that ball would mean
to him to have it.

00:07:18.296 --> 00:07:22.636 A:middle
It turns out the ball was hit
into the Indians' bull pen,

00:07:22.636 --> 00:07:26.366 A:middle
and his teammates decided to
play a bit of a prank on him.

00:07:27.076 --> 00:07:29.446 A:middle
They decided to hold
it for ransom.

00:07:31.056 --> 00:07:34.046 A:middle
And this is the list of
things they asked for.

00:07:34.806 --> 00:07:39.226 A:middle
[Laughter] Apple Watches,
iPads, MacBook Airs, iPhones.

00:07:40.306 --> 00:07:41.106 A:middle
It's unbelievable.

00:07:41.106 --> 00:07:42.736 A:middle
It's a shopping list
for the Apple Store.

00:07:43.516 --> 00:07:49.166 A:middle
[Applause]

00:07:49.666 --> 00:07:52.456 A:middle
Now, Brandon would have
had to raid an Apple Store

00:07:52.626 --> 00:07:53.816 A:middle
to get that ball back.

00:07:54.206 --> 00:07:58.076 A:middle
That didn't seem quite right
to us, and so what we're going

00:07:58.076 --> 00:08:00.086 A:middle
to do is we're going
to pay the ransom.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.076 --> 00:08:00.086 A:middle
to do is we're going
to pay the ransom.

00:08:01.366 --> 00:08:06.796 A:middle
And I have the ball right here.

00:08:07.516 --> 00:08:15.026 A:middle
[Applause]

00:08:15.526 --> 00:08:19.266 A:middle
We are giving the ball to
Brandon, and we are going

00:08:19.296 --> 00:08:22.646 A:middle
to give everything his
teammates asked for to them

00:08:22.646 --> 00:08:23.856 A:middle
so everybody is happy.

00:08:24.516 --> 00:08:27.266 A:middle
So congratulations, Brandon,
on a hundred home runs,

00:08:27.586 --> 00:08:28.746 A:middle
and good luck on
the next hundred.

00:08:29.516 --> 00:08:34.256 A:middle
[Applause]

00:08:34.756 --> 00:08:37.275 A:middle
Now, we've got a
jam-packed morning for you.

00:08:37.275 --> 00:08:39.275 A:middle
We are going to get
started with OS X.

00:08:39.275 --> 00:08:40.956 A:middle
We are bringing a whole bunch

00:08:40.956 --> 00:08:43.456 A:middle
of new great capabilities
to the Macintosh.

00:08:44.236 --> 00:08:47.476 A:middle
And next we've got a
great update for iOS,

00:08:48.056 --> 00:08:50.696 A:middle
the world's most advanced
mobile operating system.

00:08:51.446 --> 00:08:55.196 A:middle
And today we're bringing
native apps

00:08:55.746 --> 00:08:57.976 A:middle
to the Watch with a new version.

00:08:58.516 --> 00:09:02.636 A:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.516 --> 00:09:02.636 A:middle
[Applause]

00:09:03.136 --> 00:09:05.776 A:middle
With a new version
of the watchOS,

00:09:06.256 --> 00:09:09.686 A:middle
which gives the developers
even more time

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:13.596 A:middle
to create even greater
apps for the Watch

00:09:13.596 --> 00:09:14.976 A:middle
that will change the world.

00:09:15.856 --> 00:09:19.516 A:middle
Now, all three of these
ecosystems together provide

00:09:19.516 --> 00:09:21.946 A:middle
incredible opportunities
for developers

00:09:22.956 --> 00:09:26.216 A:middle
and unbelievable
possibilities for users.

00:09:26.756 --> 00:09:28.496 A:middle
So we are very excited
about this.

00:09:28.736 --> 00:09:31.246 A:middle
There's a lot here, and
so I am going to dispense

00:09:31.246 --> 00:09:33.426 A:middle
with my normal updates other

00:09:33.426 --> 00:09:35.866 A:middle
than to tell you
everything's going great.

00:09:36.016 --> 00:09:38.016 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:09:38.016 --> 00:09:41.000 A:middle
[Applause]

00:09:41.996 --> 00:09:43.476 A:middle
And I'd like to bring
out my friend

00:09:43.476 --> 00:09:47.436 A:middle
and colleague Craig Federighi to
take you through OS X and iOS.

00:09:47.436 --> 00:09:48.046 A:middle
Craig.

00:09:50.516 --> 00:09:53.226 A:middle
[Applause]

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:53.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Good morning!

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:02.166 --> 00:10:04.066 A:middle
It's fantastic to be
with you here at WWDC.

00:10:04.066 --> 00:10:07.136 A:middle
The team has been doing
some amazing work this year,

00:10:07.136 --> 00:10:09.786 A:middle
and I am thrilled to be able
to share it with you today.

00:10:10.316 --> 00:10:12.356 A:middle
We are going to start with OS X.

00:10:13.376 --> 00:10:16.956 A:middle
Now, our current release,
Yosemite, is a big, bold,

00:10:16.956 --> 00:10:19.776 A:middle
beautiful release
with a gorgeous new UI

00:10:20.516 --> 00:10:23.696 A:middle
and breakthrough features like
Continuity that let you work

00:10:23.696 --> 00:10:26.246 A:middle
across your devices
like never before.

00:10:27.066 --> 00:10:31.106 A:middle
Now, the adoption rate for
Yosemite is just incredible.

00:10:31.106 --> 00:10:33.846 A:middle
In fact, over 55 percent

00:10:33.846 --> 00:10:36.316 A:middle
of active Mac users are
running our latest update,

00:10:36.656 --> 00:10:40.276 A:middle
and this is just unprecedented
in the history of our industry.

00:10:41.096 --> 00:10:45.716 A:middle
[Laughter] In fact, Yosemite
has the fastest adoption rate

00:10:45.766 --> 00:10:48.086 A:middle
for any PC operating
system ever.

00:10:48.086 --> 00:10:48.956 A:middle
So thank you.

00:10:49.516 --> 00:10:55.476 A:middle
[Applause]

00:10:55.976 --> 00:10:59.696 A:middle
So for our next big release of
OS X, we knew we wanted to build

00:10:59.696 --> 00:11:01.616 A:middle
on those strengths of Yosemite

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.696 --> 00:11:01.616 A:middle
on those strengths of Yosemite

00:11:01.976 --> 00:11:04.656 A:middle
with some really great
refinements and advances.

00:11:05.176 --> 00:11:08.386 A:middle
The only real question, of
course, was what to call it.

00:11:09.616 --> 00:11:13.836 A:middle
So we had to once again turn to
our crack Apple Marketing Team.

00:11:15.466 --> 00:11:19.096 A:middle
Now, in typical California
fashion, they started

00:11:19.166 --> 00:11:20.976 A:middle
with a project kickoff meeting.

00:11:21.016 --> 00:11:22.826 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:11:22.826 --> 00:11:25.956 A:middle
And then headed immediately
into a team building off site.

00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:28.281 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:11:28.546 --> 00:11:30.986 A:middle
Now, of course they are in their
traditional Apple Marketing

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:32.656 A:middle
Free-Bottom Fridays attire.

00:11:33.456 --> 00:11:35.446 A:middle
They say it's all
part of their process.

00:11:35.446 --> 00:11:36.966 A:middle
I am not sure I get it.

00:11:37.536 --> 00:11:40.956 A:middle
Ultimately, this
didn't yield any names,

00:11:40.956 --> 00:11:42.976 A:middle
so they called in a consultant.

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:45.036 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:11:45.056 --> 00:11:49.426 A:middle
He told them the answer
was to be found within.

00:11:49.426 --> 00:11:53.056 A:middle
Not within themselves,
but within Yosemite.

00:11:53.416 --> 00:11:58.456 A:middle
And so the new name for
OS X is OS X El Capitan.

00:11:59.516 --> 00:12:08.116 A:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.516 --> 00:12:08.116 A:middle
[Applause]

00:12:08.616 --> 00:12:11.196 A:middle
For El Capitan, we focused
in two major areas --

00:12:11.526 --> 00:12:13.736 A:middle
experience and performance.

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:18.176 A:middle
For experience, we've made
Spotlight more expressive,

00:12:18.176 --> 00:12:20.626 A:middle
more powerful, and more
knowledgeable than ever.

00:12:21.556 --> 00:12:25.196 A:middle
We've made big enhancements
to the apps you use most,

00:12:25.196 --> 00:12:28.216 A:middle
and we made some real great
advancements in the area

00:12:28.216 --> 00:12:30.056 A:middle
of how you manage
windows on the system.

00:12:30.696 --> 00:12:33.606 A:middle
But rather than just talk about
it, I'd like to show it to you,

00:12:33.606 --> 00:12:35.216 A:middle
so let's start with
a demo right now.

00:12:36.516 --> 00:12:40.666 A:middle
[Applause]

00:12:41.166 --> 00:12:43.806 A:middle
Now, your first task, of
course, in a demonstration

00:12:43.806 --> 00:12:46.386 A:middle
or whenever you wake your
Mac, is finding the cursor,

00:12:46.816 --> 00:12:48.636 A:middle
and El Capitan makes
this easier than ever.

00:12:48.636 --> 00:12:51.016 A:middle
I just do that little
shake we all normally do,

00:12:51.566 --> 00:12:52.076 A:middle
and there it is.

00:12:52.076 --> 00:12:53.326 A:middle
It comes right out to greet you.

00:12:53.326 --> 00:12:53.976 A:middle
It's really handy.

00:12:54.516 --> 00:12:58.186 A:middle
[Applause]

00:12:58.686 --> 00:13:00.716 A:middle
Now, we brought other great
gestures to the system.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:58.686 --> 00:13:00.716 A:middle
Now, we brought other great
gestures to the system.

00:13:00.716 --> 00:13:01.926 A:middle
I am just going to
go here in Mail.

00:13:01.926 --> 00:13:03.756 A:middle
I have a message here from Eddy.

00:13:04.126 --> 00:13:07.456 A:middle
Looks like -- well, now --
[Laughter] -- that's a keeper.

00:13:07.976 --> 00:13:11.226 A:middle
So I can actually mark
it unread to keep it just

00:13:11.226 --> 00:13:14.246 A:middle
by swiping two fingers across
the trackpad just like that.

00:13:15.046 --> 00:13:17.646 A:middle
And this one I'd kind of like
to delete, so I am just going

00:13:18.126 --> 00:13:19.786 A:middle
to swipe it away just like that.

00:13:19.786 --> 00:13:21.336 A:middle
So some real nice
little gestures.

00:13:21.826 --> 00:13:23.966 A:middle
Let's move on now to Safari.

00:13:23.966 --> 00:13:26.976 A:middle
Now, in Safari, I have some
sites that I like to keep

00:13:26.976 --> 00:13:29.746 A:middle
around because I refer to them
on and off throughout the day,

00:13:29.746 --> 00:13:34.916 A:middle
and now in Safari, I can pin
those sites just like this.

00:13:35.616 --> 00:13:38.636 A:middle
So there's -- I am going to
pin my Twitter site here.

00:13:38.636 --> 00:13:40.696 A:middle
And of course I have been
following the Warriors.

00:13:40.936 --> 00:13:42.376 A:middle
Go Warriors, we are
going to get it done.

00:13:43.016 --> 00:13:45.016 A:middle
[Applause]

00:13:45.016 --> 00:13:45.766 A:middle
Just like that.

00:13:46.046 --> 00:13:48.746 A:middle
Now, Pinned Sites have a
lot of special properties.

00:13:48.746 --> 00:13:51.856 A:middle
For one, if I close this
window and reopen it,

00:13:52.216 --> 00:13:54.236 A:middle
you see that my Pinned
Sites are all right there,

00:13:54.766 --> 00:13:56.126 A:middle
and they load instantly.

00:13:56.666 --> 00:13:59.396 A:middle
Now, Pinned Sites also behave
differently when I follow links,

00:13:59.396 --> 00:14:00.776 A:middle
so I am just going
to click on one here,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:59.396 --> 00:14:00.776 A:middle
so I am just going
to click on one here,

00:14:00.956 --> 00:14:05.176 A:middle
and you notice it opens in a new
tab, but my pinned site remains.

00:14:05.176 --> 00:14:07.206 A:middle
Now I am going to open
up a couple more links.

00:14:07.556 --> 00:14:10.116 A:middle
This one, let's see, this one.

00:14:10.196 --> 00:14:11.316 A:middle
I will take a quick look.

00:14:11.696 --> 00:14:13.906 A:middle
This one looks like some
kind of presentation video.

00:14:13.906 --> 00:14:14.956 A:middle
This one is about the Giants.

00:14:15.156 --> 00:14:16.546 A:middle
Have you ever had
this happen to you?

00:14:16.546 --> 00:14:19.296 A:middle
You are like, Where is
this audio coming from?

00:14:19.886 --> 00:14:23.926 A:middle
Now with just a tap,
you can mute it or find

00:14:23.926 --> 00:14:27.226 A:middle
out where it came from and
shut it down just like that.

00:14:28.516 --> 00:14:32.876 A:middle
[Applause]

00:14:33.376 --> 00:14:36.496 A:middle
So I am interested in
seeing this Giants game,

00:14:36.496 --> 00:14:38.506 A:middle
and now Spotlight can
actually help me out there.

00:14:38.506 --> 00:14:40.916 A:middle
So I am just going to do a
search for the SF Giants,

00:14:41.346 --> 00:14:44.546 A:middle
and we see right now I
get current game scores,

00:14:44.546 --> 00:14:45.686 A:middle
upcoming games.

00:14:45.866 --> 00:14:48.116 A:middle
Looks like the game I want
to go to is on Friday,

00:14:48.116 --> 00:14:50.846 A:middle
so I can just search
for weather on Friday.

00:14:51.536 --> 00:14:52.526 A:middle
See we get the weather.

00:14:52.526 --> 00:14:58.226 A:middle
We can even resize the Spotlight
panel and move it around.

00:14:58.396 --> 00:15:00.926 A:middle
I mean, there's innovation; huh?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:58.396 --> 00:15:00.926 A:middle
I mean, there's innovation; huh?

00:15:02.486 --> 00:15:05.316 A:middle
[Laughter] But I can also
express myself in my own words

00:15:05.316 --> 00:15:08.366 A:middle
in Spotlight searches now, so
I can do things like slides

00:15:08.786 --> 00:15:10.836 A:middle
from Brian, and you
see I find those there.

00:15:10.836 --> 00:15:14.096 A:middle
But how about slides from
Brian about El Capitan?

00:15:14.866 --> 00:15:17.886 A:middle
You see, I find exactly what I
am looking for in my own words.

00:15:18.296 --> 00:15:20.526 A:middle
Now, this works great
in other apps as well.

00:15:20.526 --> 00:15:21.666 A:middle
Let's try it out in Mail.

00:15:22.146 --> 00:15:24.986 A:middle
So I've been really busy, of
course, the last couple of days,

00:15:24.986 --> 00:15:26.656 A:middle
so I have been getting a
little behind on my Mail.

00:15:26.746 --> 00:15:29.936 A:middle
I want to see the messages
that I've received from Phil

00:15:29.936 --> 00:15:31.396 A:middle
but that I haven't
responded to yet.

00:15:31.396 --> 00:15:36.756 A:middle
So I am just going to say
"mail I ignored from Phil."

00:15:38.926 --> 00:15:41.086 A:middle
[Laughter] There are a few,
but I will be getting back

00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:42.866 A:middle
to him right after the show.

00:15:44.636 --> 00:15:49.266 A:middle
[Laughter] So next, of course,
it's great in the Finder

00:15:49.266 --> 00:15:52.596 A:middle
as well, so if I wanted to look
at documents that I was working

00:15:52.596 --> 00:15:55.946 A:middle
on last year at this time,
I might say something like

00:15:56.116 --> 00:16:00.916 A:middle
"documents I worked
on last June."

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:56.116 --> 00:16:00.916 A:middle
"documents I worked
on last June."

00:16:01.386 --> 00:16:03.146 A:middle
And I find exactly
what I am looking for.

00:16:03.146 --> 00:16:05.176 A:middle
So this is really a
great way to search.

00:16:05.826 --> 00:16:08.306 A:middle
Next I want to turn to window
management, so I am just going

00:16:08.306 --> 00:16:10.446 A:middle
to run a script here that's
going to open up a whole bunch

00:16:10.446 --> 00:16:12.956 A:middle
of windows to simulate kind
of what my desktop looks

00:16:12.956 --> 00:16:16.016 A:middle
like after a day working on OS
X because it's a powerful system

00:16:16.146 --> 00:16:17.586 A:middle
and we tend to have
a lot of things open.

00:16:17.706 --> 00:16:21.766 A:middle
OS X provides some great ways
to navigate your windows,

00:16:21.766 --> 00:16:23.096 A:middle
and one of those
is Mission Control.

00:16:23.096 --> 00:16:27.466 A:middle
In El Capitan, we made
Mission Control smoother,

00:16:27.466 --> 00:16:28.976 A:middle
simpler, and faster than ever.

00:16:28.976 --> 00:16:31.466 A:middle
I am going to take three fingers
and swipe up on the trackpad.

00:16:31.876 --> 00:16:34.566 A:middle
We get this gorgeous
overview of Mission Control.

00:16:34.606 --> 00:16:36.166 A:middle
I'll just bring forward Safari.

00:16:36.166 --> 00:16:37.586 A:middle
Let's do that again
and bring up Mail.

00:16:38.746 --> 00:16:39.566 A:middle
Just like that.

00:16:39.566 --> 00:16:40.406 A:middle
Works really great.

00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:42.876 A:middle
Of course, OS X provides
great tools also

00:16:42.876 --> 00:16:45.236 A:middle
to organize your windows, and
one of those is Full Screen.

00:16:45.236 --> 00:16:47.596 A:middle
I am going to take this
window here full screen,

00:16:47.596 --> 00:16:49.526 A:middle
and I am going to reply.

00:16:49.526 --> 00:16:52.196 A:middle
Looks like there's a
message here from Eddy.

00:16:52.256 --> 00:16:55.836 A:middle
He says sorry about bailing
on the team dinner last night.

00:16:55.836 --> 00:16:59.196 A:middle
He was apparently
prepping for the Keynote.

00:16:59.196 --> 00:17:00.626 A:middle
So that's understandable.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.196 --> 00:17:00.626 A:middle
So that's understandable.

00:17:00.626 --> 00:17:04.465 A:middle
But it looks like, actually,
I just got a new mail

00:17:04.675 --> 00:17:08.476 A:middle
from Jeff here, and now I can
just click away, and it hides,

00:17:08.476 --> 00:17:10.126 A:middle
and then -- oh, hold on.

00:17:11.356 --> 00:17:12.246 A:middle
Busted, Eddy.

00:17:12.746 --> 00:17:14.776 A:middle
So I think I'll just
drag this, actually,

00:17:14.776 --> 00:17:18.006 A:middle
right into my Compose window,
it hops up automatically,

00:17:18.006 --> 00:17:19.156 A:middle
and I can do it just like that.

00:17:19.156 --> 00:17:20.246 A:middle
It's really great.

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:24.736 A:middle
And I can even open up
tabs in Compose as well.

00:17:25.616 --> 00:17:26.606 A:middle
It's really handy.

00:17:26.606 --> 00:17:30.556 A:middle
So this is a great way now to
work in full screen in Mail.

00:17:31.516 --> 00:17:37.006 A:middle
[Applause]

00:17:37.506 --> 00:17:37.736 A:middle
Thank you.

00:17:37.736 --> 00:17:39.666 A:middle
Now, we've done something
totally new to El Capitan,

00:17:40.236 --> 00:17:42.606 A:middle
and it's the ability
to work really easily

00:17:42.606 --> 00:17:44.356 A:middle
on two windows side by side.

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:47.496 A:middle
So I am just going to click and
hold here on the green button.

00:17:47.496 --> 00:17:50.686 A:middle
And you see it's
prompting me to pick a side.

00:17:51.196 --> 00:17:52.136 A:middle
I will just drop it in.

00:17:52.356 --> 00:17:54.436 A:middle
And you notice I get an expose
of all my other windows.

00:17:54.436 --> 00:17:56.416 A:middle
Let me pick the new News
app, just like that.

00:17:57.516 --> 00:18:02.876 A:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:57.516 --> 00:18:02.876 A:middle
[Applause]

00:18:03.376 --> 00:18:05.346 A:middle
Of course, I can
resize this window

00:18:05.346 --> 00:18:06.876 A:middle
to style it just the way I want.

00:18:06.876 --> 00:18:07.726 A:middle
How about that blur?

00:18:07.826 --> 00:18:08.716 A:middle
Again, innovation.

00:18:09.996 --> 00:18:12.796 A:middle
[Laughter] So, great
way to work.

00:18:12.796 --> 00:18:14.526 A:middle
Here I can drag links,
for instance,

00:18:14.526 --> 00:18:17.156 A:middle
from Safari right in here.

00:18:17.156 --> 00:18:19.946 A:middle
You notice in the new Notes app,
I get a beautiful graphical link

00:18:20.436 --> 00:18:21.636 A:middle
that gives me a nice thumbnail

00:18:21.636 --> 00:18:24.906 A:middle
that helps me identify
what I dragged in there.

00:18:24.906 --> 00:18:28.036 A:middle
I am going to drag
in some yurts.

00:18:28.116 --> 00:18:29.566 A:middle
I think yurts, first
time mentioned

00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:31.766 A:middle
on the WWDC Keynote stage.

00:18:31.766 --> 00:18:32.416 A:middle
There you go.

00:18:32.916 --> 00:18:33.746 A:middle
Got some yurts here.

00:18:34.056 --> 00:18:37.476 A:middle
Great way to work split screen.

00:18:37.966 --> 00:18:41.006 A:middle
We've also provided a really
easy way to move windows

00:18:41.006 --> 00:18:42.206 A:middle
into their own desktops.

00:18:42.606 --> 00:18:45.026 A:middle
So let me just take this window
here, I'm just going to drag it

00:18:45.026 --> 00:18:48.846 A:middle
up past the top of the screen,
and drop it in just like that.

00:18:48.846 --> 00:18:52.516 A:middle
So easy. I can also do this
to take a window full screen.

00:18:52.516 --> 00:18:55.026 A:middle
So let's take Photos, just
drop it in right here,

00:18:55.276 --> 00:18:56.436 A:middle
I took it full screen.

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:57.826 A:middle
Check this out.

00:18:57.826 --> 00:19:01.096 A:middle
I am going to take
Messages, drop it on Photos,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:57.826 --> 00:19:01.096 A:middle
I am going to take
Messages, drop it on Photos,

00:19:01.536 --> 00:19:04.136 A:middle
and create a split
view just like that.

00:19:04.206 --> 00:19:05.016 A:middle
Totally awesome.

00:19:06.516 --> 00:19:09.446 A:middle
[Applause]

00:19:09.946 --> 00:19:11.866 A:middle
And that is a quick look
at some improvements

00:19:11.866 --> 00:19:13.696 A:middle
to the experience in El Capitan.

00:19:15.516 --> 00:19:19.816 A:middle
[Applause]

00:19:20.316 --> 00:19:23.226 A:middle
So we saw in El Capitan
a powerful form of search

00:19:23.226 --> 00:19:25.726 A:middle
in Spotlight that lets
you compose your searches

00:19:26.066 --> 00:19:27.216 A:middle
in your own words.

00:19:28.216 --> 00:19:29.546 A:middle
It knows more than ever,

00:19:29.546 --> 00:19:33.396 A:middle
can look up weather,
stocks, game scores.

00:19:33.726 --> 00:19:37.576 A:middle
We saw gestures, for instance,
just swiping to delete in Mail.

00:19:38.716 --> 00:19:40.806 A:middle
And, of course, pin
sites in Safari

00:19:41.006 --> 00:19:44.186 A:middle
and the ability to
easily mute tabs.

00:19:44.186 --> 00:19:46.726 A:middle
A great new Notes app that
supports text styling,

00:19:46.926 --> 00:19:48.916 A:middle
checklists, and graphical links.

00:19:50.016 --> 00:19:51.986 A:middle
And better window
management than ever

00:19:51.986 --> 00:19:54.776 A:middle
with a beautiful new
Mission Control interface,

00:19:56.066 --> 00:19:59.246 A:middle
easy access to your
spaces bar, and of course,

00:19:59.246 --> 00:20:02.946 A:middle
the ability to do split
view and adjust it

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.246 --> 00:20:02.946 A:middle
the ability to do split
view and adjust it

00:20:02.946 --> 00:20:04.466 A:middle
to see exactly what
you are looking for,

00:20:04.506 --> 00:20:07.006 A:middle
every pixel of your display
devoted to your content.

00:20:07.646 --> 00:20:10.606 A:middle
Of course, there's much more
to experience in El Capitan,

00:20:10.836 --> 00:20:13.696 A:middle
but now I want to
turn to performance.

00:20:14.646 --> 00:20:17.986 A:middle
So we've optimized performance
throughout the system.

00:20:18.896 --> 00:20:22.596 A:middle
In fact, we are seeing about
a 1.4 times acceleration

00:20:22.776 --> 00:20:25.776 A:middle
in app launching,
a 2x improvement

00:20:25.776 --> 00:20:27.666 A:middle
in the snappiness
of switching apps.

00:20:28.546 --> 00:20:32.326 A:middle
The time to get first Mail
messages, twice as fast.

00:20:32.326 --> 00:20:35.516 A:middle
Opening a PDF in preview,
four times as fast.

00:20:35.516 --> 00:20:38.926 A:middle
But we've also made deep
architectural improvements,

00:20:39.336 --> 00:20:41.436 A:middle
and that brings us to Metal.

00:20:42.516 --> 00:20:44.916 A:middle
[Applause]

00:20:45.416 --> 00:20:45.846 A:middle
Thank you.

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:49.276 A:middle
Last year we introduced
Metal at WWDC as a way

00:20:49.276 --> 00:20:52.546 A:middle
to accelerate graphics in
high-performance games.

00:20:52.916 --> 00:20:55.156 A:middle
It takes the overhead
out of OpenGL,

00:20:55.466 --> 00:20:57.036 A:middle
providing a high-performance API

00:20:57.346 --> 00:20:59.646 A:middle
that gives the game
direct access to the power

00:20:59.646 --> 00:21:01.086 A:middle
of the underlying
graphics hardware.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.646 --> 00:21:01.086 A:middle
of the underlying
graphics hardware.

00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:04.556 A:middle
Well, this year we are
bringing Metal to the Mac.

00:21:05.266 --> 00:21:06.726 A:middle
And we are doing more than that.

00:21:07.606 --> 00:21:10.496 A:middle
Because we are taking the
graphic stacks on which apps

00:21:10.786 --> 00:21:13.386 A:middle
on OS X are built, Core
Animation and Core Graphics,

00:21:13.686 --> 00:21:17.556 A:middle
and moving them from OpenGL to
run natively on top of Metal,

00:21:18.126 --> 00:21:20.016 A:middle
making everything you do faster.

00:21:20.016 --> 00:21:22.366 A:middle
We are seeing 50
percent improvements

00:21:22.366 --> 00:21:25.696 A:middle
in rendering performance
and a 40 percent reduction

00:21:25.696 --> 00:21:27.986 A:middle
in the amount of CPU
necessary to do graphics.

00:21:28.316 --> 00:21:30.746 A:middle
That means improved performance
for your applications

00:21:30.836 --> 00:21:32.516 A:middle
and better battery life.

00:21:32.686 --> 00:21:35.526 A:middle
But the benefits of
Metal don't stop there.

00:21:35.986 --> 00:21:39.386 A:middle
Metal's also great for
high-performance apps.

00:21:39.656 --> 00:21:43.456 A:middle
In fact, Metal combines
the compute power of OpenCL

00:21:43.686 --> 00:21:45.136 A:middle
and the graphics power of OpenGL

00:21:45.136 --> 00:21:49.376 A:middle
in a higher performance
API that does both.

00:21:50.196 --> 00:21:51.506 A:middle
And what we've seen from working

00:21:51.506 --> 00:21:54.856 A:middle
with early pro developers
is really phenomenal.

00:21:55.266 --> 00:21:57.476 A:middle
Adobe came in and,
in short order,

00:21:57.476 --> 00:22:00.436 A:middle
was able to deliver an
eight times improvement

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:57.476 --> 00:22:00.436 A:middle
was able to deliver an
eight times improvement

00:22:00.856 --> 00:22:03.656 A:middle
in their rendering effects
inside of After Effects,

00:22:04.216 --> 00:22:07.076 A:middle
and they have been able
to take the drawing engine

00:22:07.146 --> 00:22:10.576 A:middle
in Illustrator, move it on top
of Metal, and take kinds of UI

00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:13.946 A:middle
that previously was
noninteractive,

00:22:13.946 --> 00:22:16.256 A:middle
like zoom of extremely
detailed drawings,

00:22:16.856 --> 00:22:18.806 A:middle
and make it completely flawless

00:22:18.806 --> 00:22:20.586 A:middle
and interactive,
thanks to Metal.

00:22:21.406 --> 00:22:23.856 A:middle
Adobe is so pleased with this
they said they are committed

00:22:23.856 --> 00:22:25.466 A:middle
to adopting Metal
on their OS X apps,

00:22:26.386 --> 00:22:28.126 A:middle
seeing performance
increases up to 8x.

00:22:28.756 --> 00:22:30.716 A:middle
They are excited
about what it can do

00:22:30.716 --> 00:22:32.116 A:middle
for their Creative Cloud users.

00:22:32.886 --> 00:22:36.076 A:middle
Of course, Metal is
also fantastic for games

00:22:36.076 --> 00:22:37.936 A:middle
with a 10x improvement.

00:22:37.936 --> 00:22:41.956 A:middle
That's ten times improvement
in drawing performance.

00:22:42.806 --> 00:22:46.686 A:middle
So we brought in Epic to
see what they could do

00:22:46.686 --> 00:22:49.546 A:middle
in short order, and the
results are really phenomenal.

00:22:49.546 --> 00:22:52.376 A:middle
I'd like to welcome to
the stage Josh Adams

00:22:52.376 --> 00:22:54.126 A:middle
and Billy Bramer
for a quick demo.

00:22:55.401 --> 00:22:57.401 A:middle
[Applause]

00:22:57.786 --> 00:22:59.606 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Craig.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:00.206 --> 00:23:01.906 A:middle
Thank you very much for
having us here today.

00:23:03.026 --> 00:23:06.286 A:middle
So last year Metal
revolutionized graphics on iOS,

00:23:06.786 --> 00:23:10.826 A:middle
and now Apple's amazed us again
by bringing Metal to the Mac.

00:23:11.386 --> 00:23:13.686 A:middle
Of course, this is
great news for games,

00:23:14.126 --> 00:23:17.006 A:middle
but also for the tools that
we use to make those games.

00:23:17.776 --> 00:23:20.686 A:middle
Here you are seeing Epic's
upcoming multiplayer title

00:23:20.936 --> 00:23:23.146 A:middle
Fortnite, running
entirely on Metal.

00:23:23.146 --> 00:23:25.956 A:middle
We are modifying it directly
within the Unreal Engine,

00:23:26.316 --> 00:23:28.866 A:middle
a development tool that powers
many of today's best games.

00:23:29.736 --> 00:23:31.516 A:middle
It's quite a bit going
on in this scene, though,

00:23:31.606 --> 00:23:32.636 A:middle
so let's break it down.

00:23:33.486 --> 00:23:36.096 A:middle
First, there are
64 different layers

00:23:36.096 --> 00:23:38.296 A:middle
of rendering effects,
and that's a lot.

00:23:39.686 --> 00:23:41.116 A:middle
All combining together, though,

00:23:41.116 --> 00:23:43.536 A:middle
to produce what you
see on the scene today.

00:23:43.536 --> 00:23:47.606 A:middle
If we go into a simple wireframe
mode, you can see the thousands

00:23:47.606 --> 00:23:49.276 A:middle
of building blocks that
make up this world.

00:23:49.856 --> 00:23:53.566 A:middle
We can start to add in layers,
flat shading, detailed lighting,

00:23:54.096 --> 00:23:57.496 A:middle
runtime shadows, and finally
we combine them all together

00:23:57.496 --> 00:24:00.136 A:middle
to bring Fortnite's fun and
lighthearted aesthetic to life.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:57.496 --> 00:24:00.136 A:middle
to bring Fortnite's fun and
lighthearted aesthetic to life.

00:24:00.136 --> 00:24:02.326 A:middle
The interesting thing
here, though,

00:24:02.536 --> 00:24:04.796 A:middle
is that all of the effects
you are seeing are being done

00:24:04.796 --> 00:24:06.006 A:middle
completely in real-time.

00:24:06.536 --> 00:24:08.846 A:middle
Notice how the shadows and
objects interact nicely

00:24:08.846 --> 00:24:10.226 A:middle
as Josh moves the car around.

00:24:11.036 --> 00:24:14.086 A:middle
Finally, we can change the
time of day on the fly,

00:24:14.406 --> 00:24:16.836 A:middle
dramatically altering the
mood of the entire scene.

00:24:17.716 --> 00:24:20.086 A:middle
All of this is thanks to
the efficiency of Metal.

00:24:20.606 --> 00:24:23.796 A:middle
In fact, we are seeing
a 70 percent reduction

00:24:23.796 --> 00:24:27.086 A:middle
in CPUs compared to OpenGL,
enabling developers like us

00:24:27.326 --> 00:24:28.736 A:middle
to create richer 3D worlds.

00:24:29.646 --> 00:24:33.056 A:middle
Speaking of those worlds, let's
hop into the game, Fortnite.

00:24:34.346 --> 00:24:36.136 A:middle
Now, if you've ever
built a pillow fort

00:24:36.136 --> 00:24:38.096 A:middle
and battled imaginary
monsters with your friends,

00:24:38.446 --> 00:24:39.766 A:middle
you already know how
to play Fortnite.

00:24:40.226 --> 00:24:42.196 A:middle
This is the end-of-the-world
scenario you have been training

00:24:42.256 --> 00:24:43.276 A:middle
for since you were a kid.

00:24:44.276 --> 00:24:46.676 A:middle
It's a beautifully
stylized universe.

00:24:46.756 --> 00:24:48.426 A:middle
You can destroy anything
you want.

00:24:49.056 --> 00:24:50.936 A:middle
Gather resources
and build a fort.

00:24:50.936 --> 00:24:53.036 A:middle
So let's go ahead
and wreck this car.

00:24:55.336 --> 00:24:56.346 A:middle
Gather its metal.

00:24:57.246 --> 00:24:59.736 A:middle
And continue our wanton
destruction by chopping

00:24:59.736 --> 00:25:01.556 A:middle
down this tree to get
some wood for later.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:59.736 --> 00:25:01.556 A:middle
down this tree to get
some wood for later.

00:25:01.556 --> 00:25:05.666 A:middle
Did we mention there
are purple death storms,

00:25:06.136 --> 00:25:07.846 A:middle
like this one, for instance?

00:25:07.896 --> 00:25:08.416 A:middle
We should go.

00:25:09.256 --> 00:25:11.756 A:middle
Luckily, while we were out
exploring, we found a multitude

00:25:11.756 --> 00:25:14.836 A:middle
of weapons, and this broom.

00:25:14.836 --> 00:25:17.876 A:middle
If we can just get
across the field,

00:25:18.066 --> 00:25:22.106 A:middle
our friend has been busy
building a fort across the --

00:25:22.656 --> 00:25:24.336 A:middle
did we mention the storms
are made of monsters?

00:25:24.336 --> 00:25:27.266 A:middle
We are going to need something
a bit better than this broom.

00:25:28.696 --> 00:25:31.896 A:middle
Nice! There's our friend
laying down some covering fire.

00:25:34.346 --> 00:25:35.456 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hey, look out!

00:25:36.676 --> 00:25:39.196 A:middle
&gt;&gt; We call that move
the power cord.

00:25:42.076 --> 00:25:43.236 A:middle
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

00:25:43.456 --> 00:25:45.416 A:middle
You are going to
need a bigger fort.

00:25:46.596 --> 00:25:48.116 A:middle
Place a trap, head inside.

00:25:51.286 --> 00:25:53.086 A:middle
Looks like an enemy has
broken into our fort.

00:25:53.086 --> 00:25:55.716 A:middle
All right.

00:25:56.086 --> 00:25:58.676 A:middle
Let's use that wood we gathered
earlier to fix this wall,

00:25:59.216 --> 00:26:02.436 A:middle
build some stairs, meet up
with our friend topside.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.216 --> 00:26:02.436 A:middle
build some stairs, meet up
with our friend topside.

00:26:05.136 --> 00:26:11.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Glad you could make it.

00:26:11.596 --> 00:26:13.596 A:middle
[Monster screaming]

00:26:13.716 --> 00:26:15.706 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Whether you are a
gamer or a game developer,

00:26:16.066 --> 00:26:18.966 A:middle
Metal opens new possibilities
for rich and engaging worlds.

00:26:19.666 --> 00:26:21.676 A:middle
You can download the Unreal
Engine for Mac right now,

00:26:22.186 --> 00:26:24.246 A:middle
and the Fortnite beta
for Mac starts this fall.

00:26:25.416 --> 00:26:25.996 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:26:26.496 --> 00:26:31.516 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

00:26:32.016 --> 00:26:32.486 A:middle
&gt;&gt; CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Thank you, guys.

00:26:35.506 --> 00:26:36.036 A:middle
That was great.

00:26:36.086 --> 00:26:38.856 A:middle
We have been totally impressed
with what Epic has been able

00:26:38.856 --> 00:26:40.486 A:middle
to accomplish in
such a short time.

00:26:40.916 --> 00:26:44.486 A:middle
And this is in part because the
work they did to adopt Metal

00:26:44.486 --> 00:26:48.156 A:middle
in their rendering engines for
iOS immediately pays dividends

00:26:48.156 --> 00:26:51.436 A:middle
on OS X, and we are seeing
this with many other developers

00:26:51.506 --> 00:26:54.676 A:middle
as well who are bringing their
gaming engines immediately

00:26:54.676 --> 00:26:55.096 A:middle
to the Mac.

00:26:55.596 --> 00:26:58.826 A:middle
And pro app makers are seeing
the benefits of Metal as well,

00:26:59.096 --> 00:27:01.416 A:middle
people like The Foundry
and Autodesk.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:59.096 --> 00:27:01.416 A:middle
people like The Foundry
and Autodesk.

00:27:01.526 --> 00:27:04.056 A:middle
I think we are going to
see pro users, gamers,

00:27:04.056 --> 00:27:05.496 A:middle
and all of us benefiting

00:27:05.846 --> 00:27:07.586 A:middle
from the performance
advantages of Metal.

00:27:08.516 --> 00:27:11.956 A:middle
So that is El Capitan,
improvements

00:27:11.956 --> 00:27:14.396 A:middle
to experience and performance.

00:27:15.106 --> 00:27:19.546 A:middle
Now, El Capitan is available
to all of you developers today.

00:27:20.516 --> 00:27:25.506 A:middle
[Applause]

00:27:26.006 --> 00:27:29.246 A:middle
We will be doing a public
beta once again in July,

00:27:29.966 --> 00:27:31.936 A:middle
and we will be rolling
out to everyone

00:27:32.186 --> 00:27:34.436 A:middle
with a free upgrade this fall.

00:27:34.906 --> 00:27:37.686 A:middle
And that's our update on OS X.

00:27:38.516 --> 00:27:44.936 A:middle
[Applause]

00:27:45.436 --> 00:27:47.126 A:middle
Next -- you guessed it -- iOS.

00:27:47.856 --> 00:27:51.546 A:middle
Now, our current big
release of iOS is iOS 8,

00:27:51.546 --> 00:27:55.426 A:middle
and iOS 8 was a huge release
with tons of new features

00:27:55.426 --> 00:27:58.416 A:middle
for users and a phenomenal
set of technologies

00:27:58.416 --> 00:28:00.606 A:middle
that you developers
have been able to use

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:58.416 --> 00:28:00.606 A:middle
that you developers
have been able to use

00:28:00.606 --> 00:28:03.266 A:middle
to deliver all-new
experiences to the platform.

00:28:04.026 --> 00:28:07.176 A:middle
The upgrade rate for
iOS has been fantastic.

00:28:07.466 --> 00:28:10.916 A:middle
We have 83 percent of active
iPhone users currently running

00:28:11.176 --> 00:28:12.146 A:middle
the latest OS.

00:28:12.616 --> 00:28:13.776 A:middle
And this is really important

00:28:13.906 --> 00:28:16.566 A:middle
because it means not only are
they getting the most recent

00:28:16.616 --> 00:28:20.766 A:middle
features, but they're also up to
date on all the security fixes,

00:28:20.766 --> 00:28:23.226 A:middle
and you're able to
know as a developer

00:28:23.226 --> 00:28:25.336 A:middle
that you can target
all the users

00:28:25.336 --> 00:28:27.746 A:middle
with the latest and
greatest APIs.

00:28:28.216 --> 00:28:29.076 A:middle
And this is a benefit

00:28:29.076 --> 00:28:31.896 A:middle
that actually remains
really unique to iOS.

00:28:33.516 --> 00:28:38.746 A:middle
[Applause]

00:28:39.246 --> 00:28:42.686 A:middle
So we are now looking forward
to iOS 9, and as we conceived

00:28:43.006 --> 00:28:46.016 A:middle
of what we wanted to
accomplish, first and foremost,

00:28:46.306 --> 00:28:49.406 A:middle
we wanted to elevate the
foundations of the platform,

00:28:50.086 --> 00:28:51.946 A:middle
things like extending
your battery life,

00:28:52.356 --> 00:28:55.996 A:middle
improving performance,
and enhancing security

00:28:55.996 --> 00:28:57.306 A:middle
to protect customer data.

00:28:57.306 --> 00:29:00.096 A:middle
But there was more
we wanted to do.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:57.306 --> 00:29:00.096 A:middle
But there was more
we wanted to do.

00:29:01.206 --> 00:29:04.496 A:middle
Adding intelligence throughout
the user experience in a way

00:29:04.496 --> 00:29:06.536 A:middle
that enhances how
you use your device

00:29:07.086 --> 00:29:09.156 A:middle
but without compromising
your privacy.

00:29:10.076 --> 00:29:12.796 A:middle
Things like improving the
apps that you use most

00:29:13.836 --> 00:29:17.726 A:middle
and taking the experience of
the iPad to the next level.

00:29:18.486 --> 00:29:22.126 A:middle
I want to start today with
intelligence and Siri.

00:29:22.716 --> 00:29:26.296 A:middle
Now, Siri has quietly
become incredibly popular.

00:29:26.296 --> 00:29:29.416 A:middle
It serves over a billion
requests per week.

00:29:29.766 --> 00:29:32.466 A:middle
And this is in part because
Siri has gotten so great

00:29:32.466 --> 00:29:33.646 A:middle
at understanding
what we are saying.

00:29:33.646 --> 00:29:36.866 A:middle
In just the last year, we've
seen a 40 percent reduction

00:29:37.456 --> 00:29:41.036 A:middle
in word error rate,
down to 5 percent.

00:29:41.186 --> 00:29:43.236 A:middle
That's an industry
leading number.

00:29:43.676 --> 00:29:45.946 A:middle
And Siri is 40 percent
faster than ever

00:29:45.946 --> 00:29:48.356 A:middle
at responding to what we say.

00:29:49.096 --> 00:29:53.416 A:middle
Now, for iOS 9, Siri has a
beautiful new UI and is capable

00:29:53.416 --> 00:29:54.526 A:middle
of doing so much more.

00:29:55.466 --> 00:29:57.106 A:middle
Things like "show me photos

00:29:57.106 --> 00:30:01.626 A:middle
from Utah last August" can
instantly show you the right

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:57.106 --> 00:30:01.626 A:middle
from Utah last August" can
instantly show you the right

00:30:01.686 --> 00:30:03.476 A:middle
photos from your photo library.

00:30:04.046 --> 00:30:07.066 A:middle
And Siri's really great
at taking reminders.

00:30:07.526 --> 00:30:09.896 A:middle
Now you can ask Siri
things like "remind me

00:30:09.896 --> 00:30:13.076 A:middle
to grab my coffee off the
roof of my car when I get in."

00:30:13.356 --> 00:30:15.596 A:middle
Because Siri knows now when
you've gotten in the car.

00:30:16.466 --> 00:30:18.796 A:middle
And of course, we often want
to take reminders about things

00:30:18.796 --> 00:30:21.226 A:middle
that we are looking at on our
device, some content inside

00:30:21.226 --> 00:30:22.536 A:middle
of our app, maybe a Safari.

00:30:23.246 --> 00:30:26.366 A:middle
Now you can say things
like "remind me about this

00:30:26.526 --> 00:30:29.836 A:middle
when I get home," and that
reminder refers right back

00:30:30.226 --> 00:30:32.296 A:middle
with a link to specifically
what you were looking

00:30:32.366 --> 00:30:33.906 A:middle
at when you took that reminder.

00:30:34.986 --> 00:30:36.716 A:middle
So Siri is a great assistant.

00:30:37.466 --> 00:30:40.226 A:middle
But the best assistants
are proactive.

00:30:40.966 --> 00:30:44.526 A:middle
And so on iOS 9, we are
bringing proactivity throughout

00:30:44.526 --> 00:30:45.086 A:middle
the system.

00:30:46.086 --> 00:30:48.986 A:middle
So say you like to run in
the morning, and when you do,

00:30:48.986 --> 00:30:50.836 A:middle
you like to listen to music.

00:30:50.836 --> 00:30:53.166 A:middle
Well, now your phone can
learn that about you,

00:30:53.166 --> 00:30:54.526 A:middle
and when you plug
in your headphones,

00:30:55.116 --> 00:30:57.756 A:middle
can offer up Now Playing
automatically right

00:30:57.756 --> 00:30:58.556 A:middle
on the Lock screen.

00:30:59.516 --> 00:31:03.936 A:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.516 --> 00:31:03.936 A:middle
[Applause]

00:31:04.436 --> 00:31:07.076 A:middle
And this is all
context-sensitive to the time,

00:31:07.386 --> 00:31:09.656 A:middle
the place, and even the
devices you are connected to,

00:31:09.656 --> 00:31:12.676 A:middle
so you do the same thing in the
car later on, and it might offer

00:31:12.676 --> 00:31:15.696 A:middle
up the audio book that you
have been listening to.

00:31:16.996 --> 00:31:18.016 A:middle
Now, as a great assistant,

00:31:18.896 --> 00:31:21.916 A:middle
your iPhone can now take
invitations you receive

00:31:21.916 --> 00:31:24.276 A:middle
in your email and without you
even touching them automatically

00:31:24.276 --> 00:31:27.456 A:middle
put them on your calendar
and even give you a time

00:31:27.456 --> 00:31:29.646 A:middle
to leave reminder, taking

00:31:29.646 --> 00:31:32.776 A:middle
into account current traffic
conditions, and of course,

00:31:32.776 --> 00:31:36.076 A:middle
with just a swipe, give you
access to driving directions.

00:31:37.046 --> 00:31:41.276 A:middle
Now, have you ever had this
happen to you, you get a call,

00:31:41.476 --> 00:31:42.786 A:middle
the number looks
kind of familiar,

00:31:42.786 --> 00:31:44.086 A:middle
but you are really
not sure who it is?

00:31:44.626 --> 00:31:47.286 A:middle
As a great assistant, your
phone can now look in your email

00:31:47.686 --> 00:31:51.266 A:middle
and find out who that person
might be and suggest it

00:31:51.266 --> 00:31:53.316 A:middle
to you right on the
Incoming Call screen.

00:31:53.316 --> 00:31:53.976 A:middle
It's super handy.

00:31:54.516 --> 00:31:59.546 A:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:00.046 --> 00:32:03.406 A:middle
Now, this kind of
proactivity is also great

00:32:03.976 --> 00:32:04.916 A:middle
when it comes to Search.

00:32:05.456 --> 00:32:07.426 A:middle
So now when you swipe to the
left of the Home screen to get

00:32:07.426 --> 00:32:11.036 A:middle
to Search, you see that Siri
offers great suggestions,

00:32:11.476 --> 00:32:14.406 A:middle
things like the people that you
might want to contact now based

00:32:14.406 --> 00:32:17.156 A:middle
on your upcoming meetings and
your communication patterns,

00:32:17.266 --> 00:32:20.606 A:middle
the apps that you might want
to launch based, for instance,

00:32:20.606 --> 00:32:22.686 A:middle
on what you just downloaded
from the App Store and haven't

00:32:22.686 --> 00:32:25.636 A:middle
yet tried out, or apps you
tend to use this time of day,

00:32:25.636 --> 00:32:29.886 A:middle
and also easy one-tap
links to locations

00:32:30.056 --> 00:32:32.266 A:middle
that are relevant nearby,
and even breaking news.

00:32:32.966 --> 00:32:36.546 A:middle
When it comes to Search, we
also know more than ever before.

00:32:38.026 --> 00:32:41.516 A:middle
So for instance, you can
search for sports scores.

00:32:41.866 --> 00:32:44.456 A:middle
And we now support video
search, of popular video sites

00:32:44.456 --> 00:32:48.366 A:middle
like Vivi, Vimeo, YouTube,
and the iTunes Store.

00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:50.616 A:middle
And we have these
great descriptive cards

00:32:51.056 --> 00:32:53.216 A:middle
with a Play button so
you can play directly

00:32:53.626 --> 00:32:54.556 A:middle
from your search result.

00:32:55.406 --> 00:32:59.756 A:middle
Most importantly, we now
have an API for Search.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:00.516 --> 00:33:07.096 A:middle
[Applause]

00:33:07.596 --> 00:33:09.356 A:middle
So now when a user
performs a search,

00:33:09.726 --> 00:33:13.096 A:middle
we can find content behind
the apps they have installed

00:33:13.096 --> 00:33:16.726 A:middle
on the device and pull those up
in Results, and when they tap,

00:33:17.566 --> 00:33:20.946 A:middle
they are deep-linked
directly into the application.

00:33:21.566 --> 00:33:23.086 A:middle
You see for instance
here Airbnb.

00:33:24.456 --> 00:33:25.386 A:middle
They can get their result.

00:33:26.896 --> 00:33:28.966 A:middle
Of course, we even provide
a convenient backlink

00:33:28.966 --> 00:33:31.996 A:middle
so they can get right back
to their search results.

00:33:31.996 --> 00:33:35.096 A:middle
So we think these kinds

00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:38.686 A:middle
of intelligence features
really make a huge difference

00:33:38.686 --> 00:33:39.726 A:middle
in your experience in iOS.

00:33:39.726 --> 00:33:41.736 A:middle
And to show you how, I would

00:33:41.736 --> 00:33:43.326 A:middle
like to give you
a quick demo now.

00:33:43.326 --> 00:33:50.926 A:middle
So I want to take you through
a day in the life with iOS 9,

00:33:50.926 --> 00:33:56.256 A:middle
and we are going to start with
a typical day for me today.

00:33:57.236 --> 00:33:59.476 A:middle
We are going to start
in my bedroom

00:33:59.856 --> 00:34:01.336 A:middle
when I woke up in the morning.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:59.856 --> 00:34:01.336 A:middle
when I woke up in the morning.

00:34:01.636 --> 00:34:04.926 A:middle
You will notice because my phone
knows that in the morning I

00:34:04.926 --> 00:34:08.676 A:middle
like to meditate that it's
offered me a meditation app

00:34:09.176 --> 00:34:11.176 A:middle
right here in the bottom
left of the screen.

00:34:11.596 --> 00:34:13.326 A:middle
So I can just swipe up
from the bottom left,

00:34:13.326 --> 00:34:16.096 A:middle
and I am taken right
in to meditate.

00:34:17.446 --> 00:34:19.106 A:middle
Ah, this is so serene.

00:34:19.896 --> 00:34:23.846 A:middle
Well, it looks like I got
a message here from Phil.

00:34:24.186 --> 00:34:27.505 A:middle
So Phil says that he is
putting together the invite

00:34:27.505 --> 00:34:30.896 A:middle
for tonight's big karaoke
potluck, and can I still pick

00:34:30.896 --> 00:34:33.176 A:middle
up this super awesome
karaoke machine?

00:34:33.806 --> 00:34:36.275 A:middle
Well, you know, Siri actually,
when I take reminders,

00:34:36.315 --> 00:34:38.676 A:middle
is able to link me right back
to what I am looking for,

00:34:38.676 --> 00:34:40.826 A:middle
so if I want to remember to pick
this up, I can just say this

00:34:40.826 --> 00:34:44.806 A:middle
to Siri: "Remind me
about this later today."

00:34:44.806 --> 00:34:50.626 A:middle
And so Siri will put
together a reminder,

00:34:50.706 --> 00:34:54.295 A:middle
and you see the link right
back to what I am looking for.

00:34:55.346 --> 00:34:57.646 A:middle
Well, I think after all,
meditation isn't probably

00:34:57.646 --> 00:35:00.736 A:middle
for me, so maybe I'll
move on to exercise.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:57.646 --> 00:35:00.736 A:middle
for me, so maybe I'll
move on to exercise.

00:35:01.196 --> 00:35:05.836 A:middle
So I head into the home gym
here, and because my phone knows

00:35:06.216 --> 00:35:08.986 A:middle
that when I am in the home gym
and I hook up headphones and I

00:35:08.986 --> 00:35:11.476 A:middle
like to listen to music,
watch what happens when I plug

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:14.626 A:middle
in the cord of my headphones.

00:35:15.276 --> 00:35:17.956 A:middle
Jumps right in and offers
me some energetic music.

00:35:18.356 --> 00:35:19.586 A:middle
So let's all bust a move.

00:35:19.586 --> 00:35:22.226 A:middle
I don't know what kind

00:35:22.226 --> 00:35:25.486 A:middle
of exercise we are all
doing here, but pretty good.

00:35:25.486 --> 00:35:27.596 A:middle
Looks like actually
I've got that invitation

00:35:27.596 --> 00:35:29.406 A:middle
that Phil was going to send me.

00:35:29.616 --> 00:35:32.096 A:middle
Now, normally I would have
to actually go into Mail,

00:35:32.346 --> 00:35:35.116 A:middle
look at the time, put this
on my Calendar, but in fact,

00:35:35.186 --> 00:35:37.076 A:middle
my phone has automatically
done that for me.

00:35:37.076 --> 00:35:39.906 A:middle
Let me just swipe down here
into Notifications Center,

00:35:39.906 --> 00:35:41.426 A:middle
and we will look at my
calendar for the day.

00:35:42.616 --> 00:35:46.326 A:middle
You notice it automatically has
already been added right there.

00:35:46.816 --> 00:35:48.376 A:middle
Now, if we look at
the rest of my day,

00:35:48.376 --> 00:35:50.386 A:middle
ahead I have my vocal warm-ups

00:35:50.386 --> 00:35:53.806 A:middle
for the karaoke performance,
then WWDC.

00:35:53.906 --> 00:35:57.576 A:middle
It looks like I have
a little bit of time

00:35:57.576 --> 00:35:59.656 A:middle
to prepare my dish
for the big potluck.

00:35:59.656 --> 00:36:01.746 A:middle
So I am going to head
into the kitchen now,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:59.656 --> 00:36:01.746 A:middle
So I am going to head
into the kitchen now,

00:36:02.546 --> 00:36:04.206 A:middle
and let's just swipe in.

00:36:04.206 --> 00:36:05.916 A:middle
When I am looking for
recipes, for instance,

00:36:05.916 --> 00:36:06.856 A:middle
I like to go into Search.

00:36:06.856 --> 00:36:08.436 A:middle
Let's just swipe
over into Search.

00:36:09.066 --> 00:36:12.236 A:middle
We see Siri has actually already
-- before I typed a character --

00:36:12.756 --> 00:36:15.556 A:middle
made suggestions for me
for people I could contact,

00:36:15.556 --> 00:36:18.126 A:middle
for instance, like Trent
Reznor, my vocal coach.

00:36:18.446 --> 00:36:20.646 A:middle
[Laughter] So I can just tap.

00:36:20.646 --> 00:36:22.726 A:middle
Here I can call Trent up,
and he can help me tap

00:36:22.726 --> 00:36:25.216 A:middle
into my inner pain and
rage that allows me

00:36:25.216 --> 00:36:26.746 A:middle
to fuel my vocal performances.

00:36:26.746 --> 00:36:28.856 A:middle
I actually haven't been
able to find the pain

00:36:28.856 --> 00:36:30.156 A:middle
and rage, truth be told.

00:36:30.976 --> 00:36:33.626 A:middle
Also, we have all these
great apps I can run

00:36:33.896 --> 00:36:37.226 A:middle
and locations nearby -- for
instance, because it's morning,

00:36:37.226 --> 00:36:39.706 A:middle
you see coffee and tea and
breakfast places are suggested.

00:36:39.706 --> 00:36:40.806 A:middle
As well as news.

00:36:41.376 --> 00:36:43.066 A:middle
But in this case, I
actually want to do a search.

00:36:43.426 --> 00:36:45.446 A:middle
So I have some potatoes
I think I could make use

00:36:45.446 --> 00:36:46.296 A:middle
of in this recipe.

00:36:46.606 --> 00:36:47.906 A:middle
So let's just search for potato.

00:36:48.586 --> 00:36:51.276 A:middle
Here you notice I am
getting search results right

00:36:51.466 --> 00:36:52.146 A:middle
from Yummly.

00:36:52.726 --> 00:36:56.286 A:middle
Let me tap into Yummly, and you
see I am deep-linked directly

00:36:56.286 --> 00:36:58.966 A:middle
in, so I get the great view
provided by that application.

00:36:59.646 --> 00:37:01.836 A:middle
Now, potato chips aren't
exactly what I am looking for,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.646 --> 00:37:01.836 A:middle
Now, potato chips aren't
exactly what I am looking for,

00:37:01.836 --> 00:37:03.186 A:middle
so I am going to hit
the Back link here,

00:37:03.456 --> 00:37:04.966 A:middle
and I can browse directly

00:37:04.966 --> 00:37:08.506 A:middle
in to another result,
Canadian Poutine.

00:37:08.506 --> 00:37:10.586 A:middle
That looks exactly like
what the doctor ordered.

00:37:11.456 --> 00:37:13.686 A:middle
Yes. Let's look at
the ingredients.

00:37:14.266 --> 00:37:17.266 A:middle
Looks like 6 tablespoons
of unsalted butter.

00:37:17.306 --> 00:37:18.076 A:middle
I am down with that.

00:37:18.076 --> 00:37:21.996 A:middle
I am going to make at
least a double batch.

00:37:21.996 --> 00:37:26.966 A:middle
So I can just use Search to do
a conversion of tablespoons,

00:37:26.966 --> 00:37:27.876 A:middle
figure out how much that is.

00:37:28.196 --> 00:37:30.696 A:middle
So that actually
is 3/4 of a cup.

00:37:30.746 --> 00:37:32.676 A:middle
I am going to round
up to an even quart

00:37:33.006 --> 00:37:35.926 A:middle
and make myself some
fine poutine.

00:37:37.366 --> 00:37:39.846 A:middle
[Laughter] So Search
is really handy,

00:37:39.846 --> 00:37:42.336 A:middle
but Siri is also
great at search.

00:37:42.526 --> 00:37:44.716 A:middle
So I want to jump
forward to later today.

00:37:44.716 --> 00:37:49.016 A:middle
When I think I will be
reminiscing about WWDC's past.

00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:52.496 A:middle
I can ask Siri to
help me with that.

00:37:52.496 --> 00:37:58.336 A:middle
Show my photos from last
June in San Francisco.

00:37:58.336 --> 00:38:02.436 A:middle
Oh, yeah, this is great,
all these photos from WWDC.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:58.336 --> 00:38:02.436 A:middle
Oh, yeah, this is great,
all these photos from WWDC.

00:38:02.436 --> 00:38:05.516 A:middle
You notice now Photos in iOS
9 has this great scrubber bar

00:38:05.516 --> 00:38:07.546 A:middle
at the bottom, so
I can easily slide

00:38:07.546 --> 00:38:09.516 A:middle
through photos super
quickly, just like this.

00:38:10.536 --> 00:38:14.056 A:middle
Oh, boy, now we are
into the karaoke night.

00:38:14.056 --> 00:38:15.536 A:middle
This is some fine stuff.

00:38:15.536 --> 00:38:18.546 A:middle
Phil really does an
awesome Viking crooner.

00:38:18.976 --> 00:38:19.806 A:middle
This is good stuff.

00:38:19.806 --> 00:38:22.496 A:middle
But of course, the
king of karaoke --

00:38:23.346 --> 00:38:23.856 A:middle
[Laughter] -- Eddy Cue.

00:38:23.856 --> 00:38:26.886 A:middle
In fact, when I want to get
really pumped up and inspired

00:38:26.886 --> 00:38:28.706 A:middle
for karaoke night,
I like to turn

00:38:28.706 --> 00:38:33.456 A:middle
to my Eddy karaoke album,
so let's do that now.

00:38:33.456 --> 00:38:35.236 A:middle
Show my karaoke photos of Eddy.

00:38:35.716 --> 00:38:42.116 A:middle
Oh, that is the master at work.

00:38:43.876 --> 00:38:50.396 A:middle
Hitting -- I love this hat.

00:38:50.396 --> 00:38:52.736 A:middle
[Laughter] This is totally dope.

00:38:53.426 --> 00:38:54.196 A:middle
Great stuff.

00:38:54.196 --> 00:38:56.336 A:middle
Well, I could really look
at these just all day,

00:38:56.336 --> 00:38:57.656 A:middle
but you know, actually,

00:38:57.656 --> 00:39:00.116 A:middle
my assistant has given
me a reminder based

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:57.656 --> 00:39:00.116 A:middle
my assistant has given
me a reminder based

00:39:00.116 --> 00:39:02.246 A:middle
on traffic conditions that it's
time to leave, so I am going

00:39:02.246 --> 00:39:04.966 A:middle
to wrap up this demo of
intelligence on iOS 9.

00:39:05.516 --> 00:39:13.426 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

00:39:13.926 --> 00:39:15.126 A:middle
So you've seen how
we've been able

00:39:15.126 --> 00:39:19.486 A:middle
to bring intelligence throughout
the experience in iOS 9,

00:39:20.206 --> 00:39:24.646 A:middle
but we do it in a way that does
not compromise your privacy.

00:39:26.176 --> 00:39:29.896 A:middle
We don't mine your email,
your photos, or your contacts

00:39:30.116 --> 00:39:31.866 A:middle
in the cloud to learn
things about you.

00:39:32.266 --> 00:39:35.356 A:middle
We honestly just
don't want to know.

00:39:35.986 --> 00:39:39.716 A:middle
All of this is done on
device, and it stays

00:39:39.786 --> 00:39:41.776 A:middle
on device, under your control.

00:39:42.516 --> 00:39:49.656 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

00:39:50.156 --> 00:39:52.666 A:middle
And if we do have to perform
a lookup on your behalf,

00:39:52.666 --> 00:39:55.466 A:middle
for example, for current traffic
conditions, it's anonymous,

00:39:55.566 --> 00:39:58.366 A:middle

and it's not shared
with third parties.

00:40:02.336 --> 00:40:03.226 A:middle
Why would do you that?

00:40:03.226 --> 00:40:05.106 A:middle
It is in your control.

00:40:05.546 --> 00:40:07.596 A:middle
That is intelligence in iOS 9.

00:40:08.516 --> 00:40:14.066 A:middle
[Applause]

00:40:14.566 --> 00:40:16.676 A:middle
Next, let's turn to Apple Pay.

00:40:16.766 --> 00:40:19.726 A:middle
And to take you through
it, I'd like to bring

00:40:19.726 --> 00:40:21.946 A:middle
to the stage our Vice President

00:40:21.946 --> 00:40:24.266 A:middle
of our Apple Pay
business, Jennifer Bailey.

00:40:24.316 --> 00:40:24.606 A:middle
Jennifer.

00:40:25.516 --> 00:40:29.056 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

00:40:29.556 --> 00:40:30.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER BAILEY:
Thanks, Craig.

00:40:30.316 --> 00:40:32.136 A:middle
It's great to be here.

00:40:34.386 --> 00:40:37.456 A:middle
We have been hard at work on our
goal of replacing the wallet,

00:40:37.456 --> 00:40:39.906 A:middle
and we've got some exciting
updates for you today.

00:40:40.656 --> 00:40:44.446 A:middle
I hope you've all tried Apple
Pay with our super easy, secure,

00:40:44.536 --> 00:40:45.836 A:middle
and private way to pay.

00:40:46.666 --> 00:40:50.046 A:middle
Last year we started with credit
and debit cards, and we now have

00:40:50.046 --> 00:40:52.846 A:middle
over 2,500 banks
supporting Apple Pay.

00:40:53.406 --> 00:40:56.976 A:middle
And this fall, Discover will
bring Apple Pay to the more

00:40:56.976 --> 00:40:58.876 A:middle
than 50 million card members.

00:40:59.516 --> 00:41:04.436 A:middle

[Applause]

00:41:04.936 --> 00:41:08.306 A:middle
Popular merchants are also
expanding their acceptance

00:41:08.546 --> 00:41:11.266 A:middle
for Apple Pay, including
great retailers

00:41:11.326 --> 00:41:13.386 A:middle
who will be supporting
Apple Pay this year,

00:41:13.386 --> 00:41:16.906 A:middle
including Trader Joe's,
Baskin-Robbins, and JCPenny.

00:41:18.016 --> 00:41:21.296 A:middle
These incredible brands join
a great list of the biggest

00:41:21.296 --> 00:41:23.276 A:middle
and best merchants
supporting Apple Pay

00:41:23.276 --> 00:41:24.746 A:middle
since our launch in October.

00:41:24.746 --> 00:41:28.306 A:middle
And for you are basketball
fans, if you are lucky enough

00:41:28.306 --> 00:41:30.986 A:middle
to have finals tickets,
you will be able to pay

00:41:30.986 --> 00:41:34.716 A:middle
for all your team logo wear at
both arenas using Apple Pay.

00:41:35.516 --> 00:41:40.066 A:middle
[Applause]

00:41:40.566 --> 00:41:42.886 A:middle
Small businesses are
also important for us,

00:41:43.106 --> 00:41:45.506 A:middle
so we are working with
innovative companies like Square

00:41:45.506 --> 00:41:48.696 A:middle
to enable millions of small
businesses to accept Apple Pay.

00:41:49.126 --> 00:41:53.586 A:middle
This fall, Square will
launch a gorgeous new reader.

00:41:54.286 --> 00:41:57.496 A:middle
Preorders are starting
today on square.com,

00:41:57.496 --> 00:41:58.566 A:middle
and these will be available

00:41:58.566 --> 00:42:01.306 A:middle
in our Apple Retail
Stores starting this fall.

in our Apple Retail
Stores starting this fall.

00:42:02.006 --> 00:42:05.836 A:middle
With fantastic support of
merchants, both large and small,

00:42:06.096 --> 00:42:09.976 A:middle
we will surpass 1 million
locations accepting Apple Pay

00:42:10.036 --> 00:42:10.786 A:middle
next month.

00:42:11.516 --> 00:42:16.766 A:middle
[Applause]

00:42:17.266 --> 00:42:19.596 A:middle
And thanks to our
amazing developers,

00:42:20.226 --> 00:42:22.716 A:middle
we have great momentum
within apps as well.

00:42:22.716 --> 00:42:25.826 A:middle
Apple Pay is so easy
to use in-app,

00:42:25.826 --> 00:42:28.956 A:middle
our developers are telling
us they are seeing more

00:42:28.956 --> 00:42:31.906 A:middle
than two times increase
in checkout rates.

00:42:32.676 --> 00:42:34.946 A:middle
And we are adding new
apps with Apple Pay

00:42:34.946 --> 00:42:36.496 A:middle
to the App Store every day.

00:42:36.866 --> 00:42:39.366 A:middle
Here are some of the latest,
representing a great range

00:42:39.366 --> 00:42:43.016 A:middle
of categories, from
Delta in travel to Etsy,

00:42:43.016 --> 00:42:44.936 A:middle
the leading crafts marketplace.

00:42:45.646 --> 00:42:49.946 A:middle
These apps join an incredible
group that are redefining new

00:42:49.946 --> 00:42:53.436 A:middle
and simpler ways to pay.

00:42:53.656 --> 00:42:56.456 A:middle
We're also excited to be
working with Pinterest.

00:42:56.936 --> 00:42:59.616 A:middle
Later this month, Pinterest
will launch Buyable Pins,

00:42:59.616 --> 00:43:03.446 A:middle
where you will be able to buy
items from thousands of stores,

where you will be able to buy
items from thousands of stores,

00:43:03.446 --> 00:43:06.106 A:middle
including Neiman
Marcus and Macy's,

00:43:06.286 --> 00:43:09.946 A:middle
right from within the
Pinterest app using Apple Pay,

00:43:09.946 --> 00:43:11.406 A:middle
and only on iOS.

00:43:12.516 --> 00:43:19.776 A:middle
[Applause]

00:43:20.276 --> 00:43:22.276 A:middle
With the great momentum
of Apple Pay in the U.S.,

00:43:22.476 --> 00:43:24.316 A:middle
we are now excited to announce

00:43:24.316 --> 00:43:26.976 A:middle
that we are bringing
Apple Pay to the UK.

00:43:27.516 --> 00:43:32.346 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

00:43:32.846 --> 00:43:35.646 A:middle
And it's coming next month!

00:43:36.016 --> 00:43:37.556 A:middle
[Applause]

00:43:37.556 --> 00:43:40.866 A:middle
We will launch with eight
of the most popular banks,

00:43:40.866 --> 00:43:43.036 A:middle
with more coming this fall.

00:43:43.636 --> 00:43:46.096 A:middle
With this great lineup of
banks, we will support more

00:43:46.096 --> 00:43:50.636 A:middle
than 70 percent of the credit
and debit cards in the UK.

00:43:50.976 --> 00:43:53.756 A:middle
Great merchants are also
lining up to support Apple Pay,

00:43:53.756 --> 00:43:57.926 A:middle
like Boots, Costa Coffee,
and iconic British brands,

00:43:57.926 --> 00:43:59.936 A:middle
like Marks and Spencer
and Waitrose.

00:43:59.936 --> 00:44:04.026 A:middle
We will have over 250,000
locations supporting Apple Pay

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:59.936 --> 00:44:04.026 A:middle
We will have over 250,000
locations supporting Apple Pay

00:44:04.026 --> 00:44:04.706 A:middle
in the UK.

00:44:04.966 --> 00:44:06.856 A:middle
That's more than we
started with in the U.S.

00:44:06.856 --> 00:44:08.096 A:middle
at our initial launch.

00:44:09.286 --> 00:44:11.726 A:middle
We are also thrilled that
our customers will be able

00:44:11.726 --> 00:44:13.676 A:middle
to commute and pay
for their fares

00:44:13.676 --> 00:44:16.676 A:middle
on the London transportation
system with Apple Pay.

00:44:17.516 --> 00:44:24.146 A:middle
[Applause]

00:44:24.646 --> 00:44:26.126 A:middle
So that's Apple Pay
coming to the UK.

00:44:26.126 --> 00:44:28.916 A:middle
Now let's talk about
some of the new features

00:44:28.916 --> 00:44:30.606 A:middle
that we are adding in iOS 9.

00:44:31.506 --> 00:44:33.796 A:middle
First, you will be
able to add your store,

00:44:33.796 --> 00:44:35.366 A:middle
credit, and debit cards.

00:44:36.216 --> 00:44:39.306 A:middle
Store cards offer unique
membership benefits,

00:44:39.526 --> 00:44:42.816 A:middle
and leading retailers
like Kohl's, JCPenney,

00:44:42.906 --> 00:44:46.396 A:middle
and BJs will be the first to
offer their cards on Apple Pay.

00:44:47.416 --> 00:44:50.296 A:middle
We will also add loyalty
and rewards cards,

00:44:50.436 --> 00:44:52.226 A:middle
also with a great
lineup of merchants.

00:44:52.626 --> 00:44:55.676 A:middle
Kohl's will bring
Yes2You programs,

00:44:55.676 --> 00:44:59.146 A:middle
Walgreens their Balance Rewards
card, and for your coffee

00:44:59.146 --> 00:45:02.726 A:middle
and doughnut lovers, Dunkin'
Donuts will bring Apple Pay

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:59.146 --> 00:45:02.726 A:middle
and doughnut lovers, Dunkin'
Donuts will bring Apple Pay

00:45:02.856 --> 00:45:05.676 A:middle
to their DDPerks
beginning this fall.

00:45:06.516 --> 00:45:11.506 A:middle
[Applause]

00:45:12.006 --> 00:45:15.596 A:middle
and Apple Pay automatically
presents the right card,

00:45:15.686 --> 00:45:17.286 A:middle
so you will never miss a reward.

00:45:17.886 --> 00:45:21.666 A:middle
With the expansion of Apple
Pay and the new types of cards,

00:45:21.666 --> 00:45:25.516 A:middle
we decided it's time to
rename Passbook to Wallet.

00:45:26.516 --> 00:45:32.176 A:middle
[Applause]

00:45:32.676 --> 00:45:35.876 A:middle
One place for all your credit
and debit cards, loyalty cards,

00:45:35.956 --> 00:45:37.856 A:middle
boarding passes, and more.

00:45:38.466 --> 00:45:41.316 A:middle
We told you last year
that our ultimate goal was

00:45:41.316 --> 00:45:42.986 A:middle
to replace the wallet,
and we are well

00:45:42.986 --> 00:45:44.946 A:middle
on the way to doing just that.

00:45:45.936 --> 00:45:49.676 A:middle
We couldn't be happier with
the progress towards our vision

00:45:49.896 --> 00:45:51.786 A:middle
and with the momentum
of Apple Pay.

00:45:51.786 --> 00:45:52.566 A:middle
Thank you.

00:45:53.516 --> 00:46:02.516 A:middle
[Applause]

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

[Applause]

00:46:03.016 --> 00:46:03.986 A:middle
&gt;&gt; CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
So that's Apple Pay.

00:46:04.456 --> 00:46:06.756 A:middle
Let's turn now to
our enhancements

00:46:06.756 --> 00:46:11.026 A:middle
to the apps you use most, and we
are going to start with Notes.

00:46:11.666 --> 00:46:15.466 A:middle
Notes is used regularly by about
half of our users on iPhone,

00:46:15.916 --> 00:46:18.926 A:middle
and for iOS 9, we have some
really great enhancements.

00:46:19.656 --> 00:46:21.046 A:middle
It starts with how you
work with simple text.

00:46:21.876 --> 00:46:24.976 A:middle
So now Notes provides
a really handy toolbar

00:46:25.556 --> 00:46:28.016 A:middle
with formatting options,
so it's easy, for instance,

00:46:28.016 --> 00:46:31.206 A:middle
to create titles, heading
styles, numbered lists.

00:46:31.916 --> 00:46:35.406 A:middle
But of course, we all like to
create checklists in our notes,

00:46:35.406 --> 00:46:37.176 A:middle
and so Notes makes
that really easy.

00:46:37.506 --> 00:46:39.836 A:middle
And of course, you can
just check off your items

00:46:40.146 --> 00:46:40.726 A:middle
with just a tap.

00:46:41.886 --> 00:46:44.146 A:middle
Now, because a picture is
worth a thousand words,

00:46:44.616 --> 00:46:47.836 A:middle
we make it easy to get at your
camera and your camera roll

00:46:47.836 --> 00:46:50.796 A:middle
and put photos directly
in your notes.

00:46:50.916 --> 00:46:54.536 A:middle
We are also providing a great
new way to capture your ideas

00:46:55.256 --> 00:46:57.396 A:middle
by just drawing with
your finger.

00:46:58.036 --> 00:46:59.926 A:middle
We provide some great
drawing tools.

00:46:59.926 --> 00:47:01.626 A:middle
You can make sketches
with these tools

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:59.926 --> 00:47:01.626 A:middle
You can make sketches
with these tools

00:47:01.876 --> 00:47:03.706 A:middle
and drop them right
inside your note.

00:47:04.516 --> 00:47:08.206 A:middle
[Applause]

00:47:08.706 --> 00:47:10.446 A:middle
Now, I don't know
if you are like me,

00:47:10.446 --> 00:47:11.986 A:middle
but a lot of times the
things I want to put

00:47:11.986 --> 00:47:13.816 A:middle
on my notes are things I
am looking at that I find

00:47:13.816 --> 00:47:16.366 A:middle
in other apps -- for
instance, a web page in Safari.

00:47:17.236 --> 00:47:19.816 A:middle
So now from the Share
sheet, you can just

00:47:19.906 --> 00:47:23.506 A:middle
with a tap add a link
right back into your notes.

00:47:24.156 --> 00:47:26.506 A:middle
And we make it really
easy to find your notes.

00:47:26.946 --> 00:47:28.816 A:middle
So we organize them
by time, of course,

00:47:28.816 --> 00:47:30.416 A:middle
and now we have these
great thumbnails

00:47:30.416 --> 00:47:32.386 A:middle
to let you see your
embedded images at a glance,

00:47:32.386 --> 00:47:35.826 A:middle
but we also provide this
cool new Attachments view

00:47:36.286 --> 00:47:40.296 A:middle
that shows you all of your
photos, your maps links,

00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:43.116 A:middle
your website links, and when
you tap, you can get right back

00:47:43.296 --> 00:47:44.376 A:middle
to the note where
they came from.

00:47:44.996 --> 00:47:49.076 A:middle
Now, Notes is great
on iPhone, on iPad,

00:47:49.076 --> 00:47:50.636 A:middle
and of course, on
the Mac as well.

00:47:50.636 --> 00:47:54.346 A:middle
And all of your content is
kept up to date across all

00:47:54.346 --> 00:47:56.236 A:middle
of your devices via iCloud.

00:47:56.996 --> 00:47:58.616 A:middle
That's a quick update to Notes.

00:47:59.516 --> 00:48:04.696 A:middle

[Applause]

00:48:05.196 --> 00:48:06.926 A:middle
Next, let's turn to Maps.

00:48:07.146 --> 00:48:10.116 A:middle
We've continued to
invest heavily in Maps,

00:48:10.176 --> 00:48:12.036 A:middle
and the improvements
are really awesome.

00:48:12.366 --> 00:48:16.186 A:middle
We are seeing five billion
user requests per week.

00:48:17.046 --> 00:48:20.326 A:middle
Usage on iOS is 3.5 times higher

00:48:20.536 --> 00:48:23.726 A:middle
than for the next
leading mapping app.

00:48:23.726 --> 00:48:24.986 A:middle
Now, Maps, of course,

00:48:25.386 --> 00:48:28.786 A:middle
historically have been
focused on drivers.

00:48:29.116 --> 00:48:31.816 A:middle
They emphasize things
like freeways and roads.

00:48:32.466 --> 00:48:37.106 A:middle
But we know for a lot of our iOS
users, they are mostly focused

00:48:37.106 --> 00:48:41.416 A:middle
on public transit, and so now
we've created a great map just

00:48:41.416 --> 00:48:43.526 A:middle
for them.

00:48:43.856 --> 00:48:45.206 A:middle
[Applause] Yes, it's Transit.

00:48:46.516 --> 00:48:49.356 A:middle
[Applause]

00:48:49.856 --> 00:48:52.286 A:middle
With Transit, we provide
a map that emphasizes all

00:48:52.286 --> 00:48:55.576 A:middle
of the different transit
lines, buses, and trains,

00:48:55.576 --> 00:48:58.586 A:middle
subway stations and so forth,
and when you tap on a station,

00:48:59.026 --> 00:49:01.046 A:middle
you can see all the
lines that run through it

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:59.026 --> 00:49:01.046 A:middle
you can see all the
lines that run through it

00:49:01.266 --> 00:49:02.396 A:middle
with their departure times.

00:49:02.816 --> 00:49:07.376 A:middle
And we do multimodal routing,
whether you are taking a train,

00:49:07.726 --> 00:49:10.056 A:middle
a subway, a bus, or a ferry.

00:49:10.596 --> 00:49:14.066 A:middle
And we provide step-by-step
directions, including time

00:49:14.276 --> 00:49:15.386 A:middle
for walking directions.

00:49:15.386 --> 00:49:19.686 A:middle
But we've taken special care
to get the details right,

00:49:19.826 --> 00:49:21.686 A:middle
the ones that matter,
with Transit.

00:49:22.446 --> 00:49:25.916 A:middle
For instance, if you take a
subway station like this one

00:49:25.916 --> 00:49:30.036 A:middle
in Columbus Circle in New York,
it's not just a point on a map.

00:49:31.016 --> 00:49:32.016 A:middle
If you look closer,

00:49:32.296 --> 00:49:35.536 A:middle
it's actually an enormous
underground structure spanning

00:49:35.536 --> 00:49:40.736 A:middle
many city blocks, and so
we carefully surveyed all

00:49:40.736 --> 00:49:42.606 A:middle
of the entrances and exits

00:49:43.266 --> 00:49:46.166 A:middle
so that we could give you
walking directions based

00:49:46.166 --> 00:49:48.896 A:middle
on the time to travel from
where you actually are.

00:49:49.276 --> 00:49:51.456 A:middle
Now, this not only saves
you a ton of walking,

00:49:51.696 --> 00:49:53.276 A:middle
but it also probably
is the difference

00:49:53.326 --> 00:49:56.096 A:middle
between catching your train
on time and being stuck.

00:49:56.416 --> 00:49:57.836 A:middle
[Applause] It's really great.

00:49:58.516 --> 00:50:04.306 A:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:58.516 --> 00:50:04.306 A:middle
[Applause]

00:50:04.806 --> 00:50:08.076 A:middle
We've taught Siri all about
Transit, so it's effortless

00:50:08.076 --> 00:50:10.226 A:middle
to ask Siri for directions.

00:50:11.016 --> 00:50:13.986 A:middle
And we are going to be
rolling Maps out, Transit,

00:50:14.286 --> 00:50:18.286 A:middle
starting with these cities
across the world, and --

00:50:19.296 --> 00:50:21.786 A:middle
[Applause] -- with these
and 300 more in China.

00:50:22.516 --> 00:50:29.216 A:middle
[Applause]

00:50:29.716 --> 00:50:31.456 A:middle
Now, when it comes
to searching in Maps,

00:50:31.456 --> 00:50:33.686 A:middle
we are now letting
you find locations

00:50:33.686 --> 00:50:35.886 A:middle
by type nearby with just a tap.

00:50:35.886 --> 00:50:38.566 A:middle
And when you find the
location you are interested in,

00:50:39.206 --> 00:50:41.206 A:middle
the card will tell you
right away right there

00:50:41.206 --> 00:50:43.256 A:middle
in the bottom whether
they support Apple Pay.

00:50:43.576 --> 00:50:44.846 A:middle
Support those Apple
Pay merchants.

00:50:45.516 --> 00:50:48.846 A:middle
[Applause]

00:50:49.346 --> 00:50:52.776 A:middle
Maps is great on
iPhone and iPad,

00:50:52.776 --> 00:50:55.266 A:middle
and of course, the Mac as well.

00:50:56.296 --> 00:50:57.686 A:middle
And that is Maps.

00:50:58.516 --> 00:51:04.886 A:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:58.516 --> 00:51:04.886 A:middle
[Applause]

00:51:05.386 --> 00:51:09.996 A:middle
The apps that we've chosen
to build in to iOS are there

00:51:09.996 --> 00:51:12.676 A:middle
because they represent
fundamental experiences

00:51:13.506 --> 00:51:15.026 A:middle
to living on a mobile device.

00:51:15.756 --> 00:51:19.176 A:middle
And there's been one that we've
been wanting to do for years,

00:51:19.246 --> 00:51:22.746 A:middle
something that so many of
us find ourselves wanting

00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:27.916 A:middle
to do every day on our device,
and so today I'm pleased

00:51:27.916 --> 00:51:30.686 A:middle
to announce that we are
introducing a new application,

00:51:31.706 --> 00:51:33.166 A:middle
and it's called News.

00:51:34.436 --> 00:51:37.086 A:middle
News is beautiful content

00:51:37.816 --> 00:51:41.866 A:middle
from the world's greatest
sources personalized for you.

00:51:42.596 --> 00:51:44.876 A:middle
Now, here's an article in News.

00:51:45.466 --> 00:51:46.686 A:middle
It's absolutely stunning.

00:51:47.486 --> 00:51:51.306 A:middle
Now, publishers can easily
create beautiful content using

00:51:51.306 --> 00:51:56.406 A:middle
gorgeous imagery, custom
layout, and rich typography.

00:51:57.736 --> 00:52:01.256 A:middle
But News is also interactive,
and so to give you a look

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:57.736 --> 00:52:01.256 A:middle
But News is also interactive,
and so to give you a look

00:52:01.256 --> 00:52:03.876 A:middle
at News in action,
I'd like to invite

00:52:04.026 --> 00:52:06.846 A:middle
to the stage our Vice
President of Application,

00:52:07.086 --> 00:52:09.296 A:middle
Product Management,
Susan Prescott.

00:52:09.746 --> 00:52:09.956 A:middle
Susan.

00:52:10.516 --> 00:52:14.566 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

00:52:15.066 --> 00:52:19.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; SUSAN PRESCOTT:
Thanks, Craig.

00:52:19.666 --> 00:52:20.196 A:middle
Thank you.

00:52:20.196 --> 00:52:22.106 A:middle
I am really excited
to be the first person

00:52:22.106 --> 00:52:23.366 A:middle
to show you our new News app.

00:52:23.366 --> 00:52:25.296 A:middle
It's right here on
the Home screen.

00:52:25.756 --> 00:52:28.876 A:middle
The first thing News wants to do
is get a sense of what I like,

00:52:28.876 --> 00:52:30.226 A:middle
so it's going to
give me a short list

00:52:30.226 --> 00:52:32.396 A:middle
of really great choices
to choose from.

00:52:33.216 --> 00:52:37.156 A:middle
And you'll see as I tap,
additional recommendations come

00:52:37.156 --> 00:52:39.676 A:middle
in on the bottom to give
you even more choices.

00:52:39.946 --> 00:52:43.386 A:middle
So I read Atlantic, Wired,
New York Times, and ESPN.

00:52:43.386 --> 00:52:45.216 A:middle
I am still with you, Warriors!

00:52:46.256 --> 00:52:48.666 A:middle
And Daring Fireball.

00:52:48.666 --> 00:52:52.736 A:middle
Topics, too, like science,
baking, and travel.

00:52:52.736 --> 00:52:55.406 A:middle
I could keep going, but I
think that's a great start,

00:52:55.406 --> 00:52:57.786 A:middle
so I will tap Done.

00:52:57.786 --> 00:53:00.836 A:middle
News creates a personalized
feed called For You.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:52:57.786 --> 00:53:00.836 A:middle
News creates a personalized
feed called For You.

00:53:01.466 --> 00:53:03.876 A:middle
It's based on the
choices I just made,

00:53:04.086 --> 00:53:06.126 A:middle
and it's all my News
in one place.

00:53:06.836 --> 00:53:09.216 A:middle
You can see it looks great.

00:53:09.406 --> 00:53:14.546 A:middle
It's easy to scan, and it
updates every time I check News.

00:53:15.656 --> 00:53:17.566 A:middle
The articles can
come from anywhere,

00:53:17.806 --> 00:53:21.326 A:middle
but the best ones are built
in our new Apple News format,

00:53:22.226 --> 00:53:24.446 A:middle
like this Wired article
featuring Rashida Jones,

00:53:24.876 --> 00:53:26.956 A:middle
awesome in Parks &amp;
Rec and The Office.

00:53:28.036 --> 00:53:32.286 A:middle
Look at the rich
typography, beautiful images,

00:53:32.286 --> 00:53:35.916 A:middle
and my favorite part are
the really fun animations.

00:53:36.406 --> 00:53:37.546 A:middle
It's fast and fluid.

00:53:37.846 --> 00:53:41.686 A:middle
We think this offers the best
mobile reading experience ever.

00:53:42.346 --> 00:53:45.746 A:middle
To get to the next
article, I just swipe.

00:53:46.286 --> 00:53:47.996 A:middle
It's not just great
for magazines;

00:53:48.256 --> 00:53:49.476 A:middle
it's great for newspapers too.

00:53:49.476 --> 00:53:51.766 A:middle
This is a New York Times
article, and it looks

00:53:51.766 --> 00:53:52.906 A:middle
like a New York Times article.

00:53:53.576 --> 00:53:57.546 A:middle
Swipe down, there's a photo
gallery right in line, fast,

00:53:58.356 --> 00:53:59.406 A:middle
fluid to swipe through.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:54:00.256 --> 00:54:02.786 A:middle
Go to the next article,
this one's from Quartz,

00:54:02.786 --> 00:54:06.476 A:middle
but I am seeing it because I
said I am interested in science.

00:54:06.616 --> 00:54:08.806 A:middle
It's a pretty cool
article about a font based

00:54:08.806 --> 00:54:10.236 A:middle
on Albert Einstein's
handwriting.

00:54:10.836 --> 00:54:13.306 A:middle
The animation makes it
come to life, and frankly,

00:54:13.306 --> 00:54:14.796 A:middle
who knew he had such
neat handwriting?

00:54:15.006 --> 00:54:16.666 A:middle
It's kind of interesting.

00:54:17.076 --> 00:54:20.136 A:middle
Swipe again, and I get an
article from Bon Appetit.

00:54:21.036 --> 00:54:22.396 A:middle
Great summer recipes,

00:54:23.466 --> 00:54:27.926 A:middle
and a crazy little jiggly
thing, which is kind of fun.

00:54:27.926 --> 00:54:30.656 A:middle
[Laughter] So I am a little
busy right now, so I am going

00:54:30.656 --> 00:54:33.266 A:middle
to go ahead and bookmark
this to read later.

00:54:33.266 --> 00:54:37.156 A:middle
Now, ESPN, I love you, Steph.

00:54:38.516 --> 00:54:41.236 A:middle
[Applause]

00:54:41.736 --> 00:54:43.976 A:middle
Now, I read ESPN
for the articles,

00:54:44.506 --> 00:54:47.406 A:middle
but there's also
some beautiful --

00:54:47.966 --> 00:54:50.976 A:middle
[Laughter] -- photos and videos.

00:54:51.516 --> 00:54:58.816 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

00:54:59.316 --> 00:55:01.046 A:middle
Some photos and videos built in.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:54:59.316 --> 00:55:01.046 A:middle
Some photos and videos built in.

00:55:01.406 --> 00:55:02.266 A:middle
Not so much last night.

00:55:02.266 --> 00:55:05.306 A:middle
Let's see if Steph
can make this one.

00:55:05.376 --> 00:55:06.546 A:middle
Swish. All right.

00:55:06.546 --> 00:55:09.326 A:middle
He is going to be
there for us next game.

00:55:09.326 --> 00:55:15.116 A:middle
In addition, data and stats are
part of what's fun about sports,

00:55:15.116 --> 00:55:17.416 A:middle
so of course, rich info
graphics can be part of it.

00:55:17.416 --> 00:55:19.196 A:middle
I am going to swipe
back to For You.

00:55:19.386 --> 00:55:23.146 A:middle
Now, News is smart, so the
more I read, the better it gets

00:55:23.146 --> 00:55:25.266 A:middle
at showing me stories
I am interested in.

00:55:25.726 --> 00:55:28.686 A:middle
But what if I want to
discover something new?

00:55:28.896 --> 00:55:32.466 A:middle
I can tap here in the bottom
on Explore, and Explore,

00:55:32.656 --> 00:55:33.606 A:middle
based on what I've read,

00:55:33.986 --> 00:55:37.386 A:middle
will show me new publisher
channels I might be interested

00:55:37.386 --> 00:55:39.276 A:middle
in and suggested topics.

00:55:39.736 --> 00:55:41.646 A:middle
Well, I love technology.

00:55:41.646 --> 00:55:43.096 A:middle
I am going to go
ahead and follow that.

00:55:43.726 --> 00:55:47.096 A:middle
But News keeps track of
more than a million topics.

00:55:47.466 --> 00:55:50.216 A:middle
So I can be much more
specific about my interests.

00:55:50.586 --> 00:55:53.076 A:middle
To do that, I can tap
on Search and type.

00:55:53.146 --> 00:55:55.366 A:middle
I am going to type Swift.

00:55:55.366 --> 00:55:59.106 A:middle
And I get a number of hits,
everything from Taylor Swift,

00:55:59.966 --> 00:56:01.106 A:middle
to what I was looking for,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:55:59.966 --> 00:56:01.106 A:middle
to what I was looking for,

00:56:01.106 --> 00:56:02.746 A:middle
Apple's new programming
language.

00:56:03.296 --> 00:56:07.096 A:middle
So it's a beautiful feed,
and what's really cool

00:56:07.096 --> 00:56:10.116 A:middle
about this is there are powerful
machine learning algorithms

00:56:10.216 --> 00:56:12.706 A:middle
that analyze the contents
of the articles to figure

00:56:12.706 --> 00:56:15.386 A:middle
out which stories
belong in which article.

00:56:15.966 --> 00:56:17.836 A:middle
This looks like just
what I was hoping for.

00:56:17.836 --> 00:56:21.126 A:middle
I am going to go ahead and
add Swift to my Favorites.

00:56:21.606 --> 00:56:23.246 A:middle
So let's take a look
at Favorites.

00:56:23.246 --> 00:56:24.216 A:middle
I will tap down here.

00:56:25.356 --> 00:56:27.806 A:middle
Favorites is where I can see
everything I am following,

00:56:28.276 --> 00:56:30.726 A:middle
including Swift,
which I just added.

00:56:31.116 --> 00:56:33.036 A:middle
It's a great place to
go if I want to dig

00:56:33.036 --> 00:56:34.836 A:middle
into a particular
topic or if I want

00:56:34.836 --> 00:56:36.886 A:middle
to read a newspaper
or a magazine.

00:56:36.886 --> 00:56:39.106 A:middle
Let's say today I
want to read Wired.

00:56:39.856 --> 00:56:41.126 A:middle
You can tell I am in
the Wired channel.

00:56:41.126 --> 00:56:42.626 A:middle
You see the Wired
logo at the top

00:56:42.626 --> 00:56:45.376 A:middle
and the Wired channel
starting with Top Stories.

00:56:46.586 --> 00:56:49.856 A:middle
I can swipe through and see a
collection of the all the print

00:56:49.856 --> 00:56:52.446 A:middle
and web stories built
in Apple News format,

00:56:52.616 --> 00:56:53.446 A:middle
and it looks terrific.

00:56:53.446 --> 00:56:56.656 A:middle
I am going to look
at one more story.

00:56:57.736 --> 00:57:01.376 A:middle
This is about the first
civilian artist in space.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:56:57.736 --> 00:57:01.376 A:middle
This is about the first
civilian artist in space.

00:57:02.546 --> 00:57:04.356 A:middle
Cool concept and really cool.

00:57:04.866 --> 00:57:07.186 A:middle
I want to show you this.

00:57:07.346 --> 00:57:09.616 A:middle
We've taken photo
galleries to the next level

00:57:10.036 --> 00:57:11.986 A:middle
with something we
call Photo Mosaics.

00:57:12.416 --> 00:57:14.636 A:middle
Look how beautiful
it looks on the page.

00:57:15.736 --> 00:57:18.076 A:middle
Stunning. And, as you'd expect,

00:57:19.156 --> 00:57:22.666 A:middle
I just tap to zoom
in on the photos.

00:57:23.466 --> 00:57:24.706 A:middle
It looks great.

00:57:25.646 --> 00:57:28.086 A:middle
We think there's never been a
more beautiful magazine reading

00:57:28.086 --> 00:57:30.446 A:middle
experience, a mobile reading
experience in general,

00:57:30.446 --> 00:57:32.276 A:middle
and this is just
one of many channels

00:57:32.736 --> 00:57:35.296 A:middle
with beautiful stories
built in Apple News format.

00:57:35.516 --> 00:57:37.256 A:middle
That is a really
quick look at News.

00:57:37.416 --> 00:57:38.736 A:middle
We can't wait to get
it in your hands.

00:57:38.736 --> 00:57:39.866 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:57:40.516 --> 00:57:50.726 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

00:57:51.226 --> 00:57:52.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
So that's News.

00:57:52.526 --> 00:57:54.226 A:middle
Stunning content.

00:57:54.786 --> 00:57:56.186 A:middle
Personalized for you.

00:57:56.606 --> 00:58:00.706 A:middle
Fantastic on iPad and
on iPhone as well.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:57:56.606 --> 00:58:00.706 A:middle
Fantastic on iPad and
on iPhone as well.

00:58:01.276 --> 00:58:03.676 A:middle
And of course, unlike just

00:58:03.676 --> 00:58:06.256 A:middle
about any other news
aggregation service we are aware

00:58:06.256 --> 00:58:09.186 A:middle
of on the planet, News is
designed from the ground

00:58:09.186 --> 00:58:11.886 A:middle
up with your privacy in mind.

00:58:12.266 --> 00:58:14.516 A:middle
We worked with leading
publishers,

00:58:14.826 --> 00:58:15.976 A:middle
like The New York Times,

00:58:15.976 --> 00:58:19.926 A:middle
who will be delivering 33
articles daily to News users,

00:58:20.296 --> 00:58:23.826 A:middle
and ESPN, who will be
bringing the depth and range

00:58:23.886 --> 00:58:25.486 A:middle
of their phenomenal
sports reporting.

00:58:26.116 --> 00:58:29.506 A:middle
And Conde Nast, who are
bringing content from 17

00:58:29.626 --> 00:58:33.466 A:middle
of their magazines, like
Vanity Fair, Vogue, GQ,

00:58:34.006 --> 00:58:35.576 A:middle
Wired, and Bon Appetite.

00:58:36.196 --> 00:58:39.356 A:middle
And they will be joined
by many, many others read

00:58:39.356 --> 00:58:41.566 A:middle
by millions of users daily.

00:58:41.936 --> 00:58:45.456 A:middle
News isn't just for
the media titans.

00:58:45.546 --> 00:58:48.416 A:middle
Great content comes from
all kinds of sources,

00:58:48.606 --> 00:58:52.776 A:middle
and we want them all in News, so
whether it's a local newspaper,

00:58:52.776 --> 00:58:55.986 A:middle
a blog, or a special-interest
publication,

00:58:55.986 --> 00:58:57.446 A:middle
they will all be here.

00:58:57.506 --> 00:59:02.016 A:middle
We will be rolling out News
starting in the United States,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:58:57.506 --> 00:59:02.016 A:middle
We will be rolling out News
starting in the United States,

00:59:02.426 --> 00:59:04.306 A:middle
the UK, and Australia.

00:59:05.046 --> 00:59:06.316 A:middle
We think you are
really going to like it.

00:59:07.516 --> 00:59:15.516 A:middle
[Applause]

00:59:16.016 --> 00:59:18.126 A:middle
Next, let's turn to iPad.

00:59:18.126 --> 00:59:22.326 A:middle
Now, iPad is a transformational
device.

00:59:23.236 --> 00:59:29.006 A:middle
For our users in education,
business, and at home,

00:59:29.296 --> 00:59:32.506 A:middle
for many of them, their iPad
is their primary computer.

00:59:34.086 --> 00:59:38.206 A:middle
And iPads are just tremendously
powerful, so in iOS 9,

00:59:38.206 --> 00:59:41.746 A:middle
we are elevating the iPad
experience to a whole new level.

00:59:42.406 --> 00:59:43.986 A:middle
Now, it starts with
something really simple,

00:59:44.526 --> 00:59:46.206 A:middle
which is how you work with text.

00:59:47.286 --> 00:59:49.166 A:middle
That brings us to the
QuickType keyboard.

00:59:49.796 --> 00:59:53.156 A:middle
Now, in iOS 8, we
introduced the Suggestion bar

00:59:53.156 --> 00:59:55.196 A:middle
that makes it quicker
than ever to type

00:59:55.266 --> 00:59:56.926 A:middle
and enter what you
are trying to get in.

00:59:58.016 --> 01:00:02.516 A:middle
But now, in iOS 9, we've
added shortcuts to that bar,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:59:58.016 --> 01:00:02.516 A:middle
But now, in iOS 9, we've
added shortcuts to that bar,

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:06.776 A:middle
so with just a tap, you can cut,
copy, paste, format your text,

01:00:07.046 --> 01:00:08.266 A:middle
access your attachments.

01:00:08.496 --> 01:00:09.416 A:middle
It's really handy.

01:00:10.236 --> 01:00:13.716 A:middle
But you know, what makes
a Multi-Touch keyboard

01:00:13.716 --> 01:00:16.346 A:middle
so special is that it
can be anything you want.

01:00:16.346 --> 01:00:17.346 A:middle
It can transform.

01:00:17.876 --> 01:00:22.326 A:middle
So now when you want to move
the cursor or make a selection,

01:00:22.846 --> 01:00:26.116 A:middle
you can now just put two
fingers down on the keyboard,

01:00:26.306 --> 01:00:27.886 A:middle
and it becomes a
trackpad instantly.

01:00:28.516 --> 01:00:33.726 A:middle
[Applause]

01:00:34.226 --> 01:00:37.186 A:middle
You can move the cursor,
you can make selections.

01:00:37.616 --> 01:00:39.676 A:middle
Of course, you can use
the shortcut bar to cut,

01:00:40.116 --> 01:00:43.446 A:middle
drag to a new place, and
paste, editing more quickly

01:00:43.446 --> 01:00:45.976 A:middle
than ever before and without
your fingers ever leaving the

01:00:46.036 --> 01:00:46.546 A:middle
home row.

01:00:46.686 --> 01:00:47.446 A:middle
It's really great.

01:00:48.516 --> 01:00:52.776 A:middle
[Applause]

01:00:53.276 --> 01:00:55.706 A:middle
And if you do occasionally want
to hook a physical keyboard

01:00:55.706 --> 01:00:58.076 A:middle
to your iPad as well, we
made that better than ever.

01:00:58.766 --> 01:01:00.996 A:middle
We provide a way to
discover all of the shortcuts

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:00:58.766 --> 01:01:00.996 A:middle
We provide a way to
discover all of the shortcuts

01:01:00.996 --> 01:01:02.926 A:middle
that can accelerate
your operations

01:01:02.926 --> 01:01:04.596 A:middle
in the applications
using the keyboard,

01:01:05.076 --> 01:01:07.736 A:middle
and we've provided
shortcuts for app switching.

01:01:07.736 --> 01:01:09.156 A:middle
This might look familiar
to some of you.

01:01:09.326 --> 01:01:12.776 A:middle
As well as to searching
in Spotlight.

01:01:13.526 --> 01:01:16.966 A:middle
So that's QuickType, but now
I want to turn to the big one,

01:01:17.326 --> 01:01:18.296 A:middle
and that's Multitasking.

01:01:19.516 --> 01:01:24.956 A:middle
[Applause]

01:01:25.456 --> 01:01:28.676 A:middle
So iPad has always supported
forms of multitasking,

01:01:28.676 --> 01:01:30.466 A:middle
like this great graphical
task switcher,

01:01:30.886 --> 01:01:32.686 A:middle
and these nice four-finger
gestures

01:01:32.986 --> 01:01:34.816 A:middle
that let you move
between applications.

01:01:35.686 --> 01:01:38.736 A:middle
But for iOS 9, we are taking
it to a whole new place,

01:01:39.496 --> 01:01:41.946 A:middle
and I'd like to show
that to you now.

01:01:42.516 --> 01:01:47.296 A:middle
[Applause]

01:01:47.796 --> 01:01:49.086 A:middle
So let's start here on my iPad.

01:01:49.086 --> 01:01:51.736 A:middle
And what I am going to
do first is double-tap

01:01:51.736 --> 01:01:55.506 A:middle
on the Home button, and you
will see our new task switcher.

01:01:56.506 --> 01:01:57.906 A:middle
It's really gorgeous.

01:01:58.736 --> 01:02:02.616 A:middle
Big, full-screen
previews of all the apps.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:01:58.736 --> 01:02:02.616 A:middle
Big, full-screen
previews of all the apps.

01:02:03.466 --> 01:02:05.126 A:middle
Just move right into
Safari like this.

01:02:05.286 --> 01:02:07.406 A:middle
But of course, often when
I am in an app like Safari,

01:02:07.406 --> 01:02:09.386 A:middle
I then just want to
quickly check my messages.

01:02:10.166 --> 01:02:12.696 A:middle
So now with just a single
finger swipe from the side,

01:02:13.956 --> 01:02:16.476 A:middle
I can slide it right in with
what we call Slide Over.

01:02:16.986 --> 01:02:18.896 A:middle
Of course, it's fully
interactive.

01:02:18.896 --> 01:02:21.326 A:middle
I can take a quick look,
maybe type a response,

01:02:21.896 --> 01:02:23.486 A:middle
put it right back,
I am back in Safari.

01:02:23.956 --> 01:02:24.616 A:middle
Do that again.

01:02:25.536 --> 01:02:30.106 A:middle
From the top, I can pull down
and bring in other applications.

01:02:30.936 --> 01:02:31.996 A:middle
So let's bring in Calendar.

01:02:32.356 --> 01:02:34.836 A:middle
Of course, fully interactive
so I can tap into another day.

01:02:35.296 --> 01:02:36.106 A:middle
Let's bring in another app.

01:02:36.106 --> 01:02:38.766 A:middle
I am going to bring
in the new Notes app.

01:02:40.016 --> 01:02:41.116 A:middle
Just like that.

01:02:41.116 --> 01:02:43.196 A:middle
Now, sometimes, of course, I
want to stay working in Notes

01:02:43.196 --> 01:02:46.226 A:middle
and Safari both at the same
time, so I can just tap here

01:02:46.226 --> 01:02:49.056 A:middle
on the divider, and
now I am in split view.

01:02:49.056 --> 01:02:51.386 A:middle
They are both completely active.

01:02:51.876 --> 01:02:55.446 A:middle
In fact, for the first time
ever, multiapp, Multi-Touch,

01:02:55.706 --> 01:02:57.256 A:middle
I can move them both
at the same time.

01:02:58.516 --> 01:03:04.556 A:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:02:58.516 --> 01:03:04.556 A:middle
[Applause]

01:03:05.056 --> 01:03:07.746 A:middle
Now, Notes is actually
pinned to the side now,

01:03:07.746 --> 01:03:09.476 A:middle
so I want to show you what
happens when I switch apps.

01:03:09.476 --> 01:03:11.986 A:middle
I am just going to move
over here to Photos.

01:03:12.146 --> 01:03:14.526 A:middle
You notice now I have Photos
with Notes on the side.

01:03:14.526 --> 01:03:16.236 A:middle
This is really great if I am
taking notes while working

01:03:16.236 --> 01:03:17.946 A:middle
across a bunch of experiences.

01:03:18.276 --> 01:03:20.636 A:middle
And of course those four-finger
gestures continue to work great,

01:03:20.636 --> 01:03:23.496 A:middle
so I can swipe my way
right back into Safari.

01:03:23.496 --> 01:03:26.386 A:middle
I can follow links, of
course, from my notes.

01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:30.316 A:middle
Let me tap on this link, and you
see Safari loads it right here

01:03:30.566 --> 01:03:31.476 A:middle
on the side.

01:03:31.476 --> 01:03:32.756 A:middle
I can adjust the split.

01:03:32.756 --> 01:03:35.206 A:middle
Let me move that over
to a nice 50/50 view

01:03:35.206 --> 01:03:36.416 A:middle
with Notes and Safari.

01:03:36.816 --> 01:03:38.476 A:middle
I can tap on links
to other apps,

01:03:38.476 --> 01:03:42.576 A:middle
so let's follow a
link into Maps.

01:03:42.716 --> 01:03:45.126 A:middle
Maps -- I really want
location accuracy.

01:03:45.126 --> 01:03:47.066 A:middle
Thank you, very helpful.

01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:50.316 A:middle
Slides right in and
shows me the location.

01:03:50.646 --> 01:03:52.676 A:middle
I can follow another
link, Maps adjusts,

01:03:53.096 --> 01:03:55.106 A:middle
I am able to stay
focused right here

01:03:55.106 --> 01:03:56.616 A:middle
in these two apps side by side.

01:03:57.206 --> 01:03:59.936 A:middle
Let's say I now want to
work Notes full screen.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:04:00.066 --> 01:04:02.126 A:middle
I can pull right
across like that

01:04:02.126 --> 01:04:03.206 A:middle
and I am in full-screen Notes.

01:04:03.746 --> 01:04:05.196 A:middle
This gives me a great
opportunity

01:04:05.196 --> 01:04:07.896 A:middle
to show you what's new with
the QuickType keyboard.

01:04:07.896 --> 01:04:09.616 A:middle
I have a to-do list
I am building here.

01:04:10.076 --> 01:04:15.966 A:middle
I am going to add an item
here to buy a new ice chest.

01:04:16.506 --> 01:04:17.026 A:middle
There we go.

01:04:17.376 --> 01:04:20.206 A:middle
On second thought, I
should probably borrow one.

01:04:20.206 --> 01:04:21.876 A:middle
I am going to take two fingers

01:04:21.876 --> 01:04:24.416 A:middle
down on the keyboard,
swipe over here.

01:04:24.416 --> 01:04:25.816 A:middle
I can reposition the
cursor like this.

01:04:25.816 --> 01:04:27.646 A:middle
Tap and make a selection.

01:04:27.926 --> 01:04:29.056 A:middle
Extend the selection.

01:04:30.336 --> 01:04:31.276 A:middle
And type "borrow."

01:04:31.446 --> 01:04:32.426 A:middle
It's really easy.

01:04:32.706 --> 01:04:33.666 A:middle
I can make bigger moves too.

01:04:33.666 --> 01:04:36.406 A:middle
I can go to the top here, maybe
select the whole sentence,

01:04:37.166 --> 01:04:42.296 A:middle
drag down, maybe do a checklist
like this, and check them off.

01:04:42.716 --> 01:04:43.606 A:middle
Just like that.

01:04:43.836 --> 01:04:44.456 A:middle
Super cool.

01:04:45.516 --> 01:04:50.086 A:middle
[Applause]

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:53.506 A:middle
Next I want to show you
multitasking in the context

01:04:53.506 --> 01:04:56.236 A:middle
of something I think we all
do quite a bit on our iPads,

01:04:57.166 --> 01:05:00.436 A:middle
which is not that --
which is watching ESPN.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:04:57.166 --> 01:05:00.436 A:middle
which is not that --
which is watching ESPN.

01:05:01.426 --> 01:05:02.406 A:middle
So let's bring up a video.

01:05:03.206 --> 01:05:05.496 A:middle
I am going to play right here.

01:05:06.626 --> 01:05:10.046 A:middle
Now, often when I am watching
a video, I may decide I want

01:05:10.046 --> 01:05:11.606 A:middle
to look something up
or check something

01:05:11.606 --> 01:05:14.986 A:middle
or maybe even get a
notification, and I want you

01:05:14.986 --> 01:05:16.446 A:middle
to watch what happens
when I tap.

01:05:16.446 --> 01:05:17.066 A:middle
Watch the video.

01:05:18.626 --> 01:05:19.966 A:middle
Now I have Picture in Picture.

01:05:20.516 --> 01:05:26.256 A:middle
[Applause]

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:31.136 A:middle
So I can still listen, I
can watch my video, I can,

01:05:31.136 --> 01:05:34.256 A:middle
of course, resize the
PIP if I want, like this.

01:05:34.926 --> 01:05:37.546 A:middle
I can move it around the
screen so it's out of the way

01:05:37.546 --> 01:05:38.456 A:middle
of what I am working on.

01:05:39.346 --> 01:05:41.636 A:middle
I can even move it off the side.

01:05:41.696 --> 01:05:44.016 A:middle
Sometimes I just want to listen
for a while while I work.

01:05:44.016 --> 01:05:46.796 A:middle
Of course, it stays
with me wherever I go.

01:05:46.796 --> 01:05:49.116 A:middle
I can pull it back,
and when I am done,

01:05:49.116 --> 01:05:50.406 A:middle
just tap to put it away.

01:05:50.406 --> 01:05:54.056 A:middle
And that is Multitasking
in iOS 9.

01:05:55.516 --> 01:06:00.856 A:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:05:55.516 --> 01:06:00.856 A:middle
[Applause]

01:06:01.356 --> 01:06:04.366 A:middle
So iOS 9 delivers this great
app switcher, and of course,

01:06:04.586 --> 01:06:06.966 A:middle
that's available
on iPhone as well.

01:06:08.036 --> 01:06:11.136 A:middle
On iPad, we have Slide
Over so you can bring apps

01:06:11.136 --> 01:06:11.936 A:middle
in from the side.

01:06:12.596 --> 01:06:14.826 A:middle
You can tap and enter split view

01:06:14.826 --> 01:06:18.336 A:middle
for simultaneous
live two apps up.

01:06:18.796 --> 01:06:20.846 A:middle
And of course, Picture
in Picture.

01:06:21.446 --> 01:06:24.906 A:middle
Now, we provide developer APIs
to let your apps work this way,

01:06:24.906 --> 01:06:28.386 A:middle
and the good news is that you've
already done most of that work

01:06:28.846 --> 01:06:31.816 A:middle
because if you've adopted
Auto Layout and size classes

01:06:31.816 --> 01:06:35.766 A:middle
to work great on the iPhone 6
and 6 Plus, well, that carries

01:06:35.766 --> 01:06:39.786 A:middle
over just like this onto iPad.

01:06:40.076 --> 01:06:42.966 A:middle
Twitter came in and was able
to do it just in minutes.

01:06:42.966 --> 01:06:44.036 A:middle
It was really incredible.

01:06:45.556 --> 01:06:50.686 A:middle
Now, Slide Over is available
for the iPad Air, Air 2, mini 2,

01:06:50.686 --> 01:06:52.956 A:middle
and mini 3, as is
Picture in Picture,

01:06:53.466 --> 01:06:56.006 A:middle
and our most powerful
split view is available

01:06:56.006 --> 01:06:58.976 A:middle
on our most powerful
iPad, the iPad Air 2.

01:06:59.946 --> 01:07:00.686 A:middle
That's Multitasking.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:06:59.946 --> 01:07:00.686 A:middle
That's Multitasking.

01:07:01.516 --> 01:07:09.136 A:middle
[Applause]

01:07:09.636 --> 01:07:12.226 A:middle
So we've seen some
great end-user features,

01:07:12.886 --> 01:07:15.906 A:middle
but of course, we've also
focused on the foundations.

01:07:16.716 --> 01:07:21.956 A:middle
In performance, as you saw
earlier in El Capitan with OS X,

01:07:22.666 --> 01:07:25.636 A:middle
we've taken the core frameworks
that we use for drawing

01:07:25.636 --> 01:07:28.146 A:middle
on the system, Core
Animation and Core Graphics,

01:07:28.146 --> 01:07:29.346 A:middle
and we put them on top of Metal.

01:07:29.346 --> 01:07:31.336 A:middle
We are seeing great
acceleration,

01:07:31.336 --> 01:07:35.116 A:middle
1.6 times improvements in
animations and scrolling,

01:07:35.116 --> 01:07:38.056 A:middle
and a 50 percent reduction
in CPU usage for drawing.

01:07:38.056 --> 01:07:39.006 A:middle
It's really great.

01:07:39.826 --> 01:07:41.846 A:middle
With battery life, we focused

01:07:41.846 --> 01:07:45.246 A:middle
on real-world use cases
and optimized them.

01:07:45.576 --> 01:07:49.816 A:middle
And we are seeing an addition
of one hour of typical use

01:07:49.816 --> 01:07:51.196 A:middle
on a full charge on iPhone.

01:07:52.516 --> 01:07:56.416 A:middle
[Applause]

01:07:56.916 --> 01:07:59.186 A:middle
Now, we know that for a lot
of you if you are running low

01:07:59.186 --> 01:08:01.796 A:middle
on power, you start searching
all over for switches

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:07:59.186 --> 01:08:01.796 A:middle
on power, you start searching
all over for switches

01:08:01.796 --> 01:08:03.616 A:middle
and turning off features
in the hope

01:08:03.616 --> 01:08:06.166 A:middle
of extending your battery
life a little bit further.

01:08:06.756 --> 01:08:09.716 A:middle
Well, now in iOS 9, we
give you a single switch

01:08:09.716 --> 01:08:12.746 A:middle
to enter what we call Low
Power mode, and it pulls levers

01:08:12.746 --> 01:08:15.286 A:middle
that you didn't even
know existed and is able

01:08:15.286 --> 01:08:19.845 A:middle
to extend battery life for
an additional three hours

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:22.185 A:middle
of typical use on top
of that additional hour.

01:08:22.336 --> 01:08:22.975 A:middle
It's really great.

01:08:23.515 --> 01:08:28.816 A:middle
[Applause]

01:08:29.316 --> 01:08:32.265 A:middle
Now, with security, we want
to protect our users' data

01:08:32.366 --> 01:08:33.975 A:middle
on device and in the cloud,

01:08:33.975 --> 01:08:36.616 A:middle
and so we are bringing
two-factor authentication

01:08:36.616 --> 01:08:40.906 A:middle
and making it easy for everyone
to protect their data in iCloud.

01:08:41.576 --> 01:08:46.386 A:middle
And with Software Update, we
want everyone to get to iOS 9,

01:08:46.786 --> 01:08:50.895 A:middle
and so we've done major
enhancements to the architecture

01:08:50.895 --> 01:08:53.136 A:middle
for our over-the-air
updates, and we have been able

01:08:53.136 --> 01:08:56.996 A:middle
to reduce the amount of free
space you need to get to iOS 9

01:08:57.486 --> 01:09:01.206 A:middle
from the 4.6 gigs that
it took to get to iOS 8

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:08:57.486 --> 01:09:01.206 A:middle
from the 4.6 gigs that
it took to get to iOS 8

01:09:01.475 --> 01:09:04.166 A:middle
down to just 1.3, so we
think everybody is going

01:09:04.166 --> 01:09:04.966 A:middle
to be getting to iOS 9.

01:09:05.515 --> 01:09:11.196 A:middle
[Applause]

01:09:11.696 --> 01:09:14.376 A:middle
So iOS 9, intelligence
throughout the system,

01:09:14.676 --> 01:09:19.026 A:middle
Apple Pay, enhancements to
really popular apps like Notes

01:09:19.456 --> 01:09:24.866 A:middle
and Maps, an all-new News app,
and incredible features now

01:09:24.866 --> 01:09:27.996 A:middle
for iPad with Multitasking
and QuickType, and of course,

01:09:28.265 --> 01:09:30.126 A:middle
enhancements to the foundations.

01:09:30.626 --> 01:09:35.196 A:middle
Now, iOS 9 is a great release
for our users, but once again,

01:09:35.576 --> 01:09:38.946 A:middle
it's a fantastic release
for all of you developers,

01:09:39.826 --> 01:09:41.326 A:middle
bringing a ton of new features.

01:09:41.326 --> 01:09:42.866 A:middle
You saw search extensibility.

01:09:42.866 --> 01:09:45.786 A:middle
We are adding UI
testing to Xcode.

01:09:45.786 --> 01:09:45.876 A:middle
[Cheers and applause] Yes!

01:09:46.246 --> 01:09:50.566 A:middle
We have a new technology
called App Thinning,

01:09:50.975 --> 01:09:54.145 A:middle
which optimizes your
downloads to exactly the subset

01:09:54.145 --> 01:09:57.146 A:middle
of resources needed for that
user's device, so you are able

01:09:57.146 --> 01:09:59.506 A:middle
to get -- take less
space on device.

01:09:59.506 --> 01:10:00.506 A:middle
It's really great.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:09:59.506 --> 01:10:00.506 A:middle
It's really great.

01:10:01.016 --> 01:10:04.156 A:middle
Now, when it comes to gaming,
we've enhanced SpriteKit,

01:10:04.156 --> 01:10:07.556 A:middle
SceneKit, and Metal and
introduced three new frameworks,

01:10:07.806 --> 01:10:10.316 A:middle
GameplayKit to bring
artificial intelligence

01:10:10.316 --> 01:10:14.306 A:middle
with path avoid obstacle
avoidance and path finding;

01:10:14.646 --> 01:10:16.896 A:middle
Model I/O to provide
beautiful lighting

01:10:16.896 --> 01:10:19.446 A:middle
on your 3D models;
and ReplayKit.

01:10:19.806 --> 01:10:21.956 A:middle
It lets you enhance
your applications

01:10:21.956 --> 01:10:26.116 A:middle
to let users record their game
play as video and share it.

01:10:26.446 --> 01:10:27.266 A:middle
It's really great.

01:10:28.516 --> 01:10:34.546 A:middle
[Applause]

01:10:35.046 --> 01:10:38.726 A:middle
Now, HealthKit has been on
fire, so we've continued --

01:10:38.726 --> 01:10:40.666 A:middle
well, we added water,
actually, to HealthKit.

01:10:40.926 --> 01:10:42.656 A:middle
We are not trying
to put out the fire.

01:10:42.656 --> 01:10:46.616 A:middle
We are adding lots of additional
health metrics to be tracked,

01:10:46.616 --> 01:10:49.666 A:middle
for instance, hydration,
UV exposure,

01:10:49.996 --> 01:10:51.046 A:middle
and reproductive health.

01:10:51.716 --> 01:10:55.016 A:middle
Now, HomeKit has been taking off

01:10:55.486 --> 01:10:57.816 A:middle
with manufacturers
introducing HomeKit peripherals

01:10:57.816 --> 01:11:02.446 A:middle
to the market now in areas like
thermometers, locks, and lights.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:10:57.816 --> 01:11:02.446 A:middle
to the market now in areas like
thermometers, locks, and lights.

01:11:02.976 --> 01:11:05.436 A:middle
And now in iOS 9, we
are adding support

01:11:05.436 --> 01:11:08.436 A:middle
for window shades,
sensors of all kinds.

01:11:08.436 --> 01:11:11.936 A:middle
For instance, carbon monoxide
sensors, motion sensors.

01:11:12.216 --> 01:11:15.576 A:middle
And we're adding support for
security systems as well.

01:11:16.096 --> 01:11:18.636 A:middle
Perhaps most importantly,
we are allowing you

01:11:18.636 --> 01:11:23.456 A:middle
to access your home remotely
and securely via iCloud.

01:11:23.456 --> 01:11:26.256 A:middle
So no matter where you
are, you can control all

01:11:26.256 --> 01:11:27.516 A:middle
of your HomeKit devices.

01:11:28.516 --> 01:11:35.246 A:middle
[Applause]

01:11:35.746 --> 01:11:36.866 A:middle
Next, CarPlay.

01:11:37.256 --> 01:11:42.316 A:middle
So CarPlay supports audio
apps and now, in iOS 9,

01:11:42.506 --> 01:11:46.126 A:middle
it also supports apps by the
automaker to control things

01:11:46.126 --> 01:11:49.876 A:middle
in your own car without
leaving the CarPlay experience.

01:11:50.226 --> 01:11:52.676 A:middle
And CarPlay is supporting
more kinds of screens,

01:11:52.726 --> 01:11:55.006 A:middle
wider aspect ratios, high DPI.

01:11:55.006 --> 01:11:58.406 A:middle
But most significantly
with CarPlay,

01:11:59.036 --> 01:12:00.216 A:middle
we are pulling the cord.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:11:59.036 --> 01:12:00.216 A:middle
we are pulling the cord.

01:12:01.416 --> 01:12:04.566 A:middle
In future cars, you will
be able to get in your car

01:12:04.566 --> 01:12:07.786 A:middle
without taking your phone out of
your bag or out of your pocket

01:12:08.306 --> 01:12:11.966 A:middle
and start experiencing
CarPlay effortlessly.

01:12:12.266 --> 01:12:13.206 A:middle
It's going to be really great.

01:12:14.516 --> 01:12:19.016 A:middle
[Applause]

01:12:19.516 --> 01:12:22.436 A:middle
Finally, let's talk about Swift.

01:12:23.516 --> 01:12:27.996 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:12:28.496 --> 01:12:29.936 A:middle
You all know that the growth

01:12:29.936 --> 01:12:33.546 A:middle
that Swift has been experiencing
is just unprecedented,

01:12:33.546 --> 01:12:35.436 A:middle
and we've all seen
it with the flood

01:12:35.636 --> 01:12:37.986 A:middle
of applications coming
in to the App Store.

01:12:38.906 --> 01:12:43.516 A:middle
Well, now we are stepping on
the gas this year with Swift 2.

01:12:44.206 --> 01:12:47.006 A:middle
Now, Swift was designed from
the beginning to be fast,

01:12:47.536 --> 01:12:48.756 A:middle
and we've continued to roll

01:12:48.756 --> 01:12:52.876 A:middle
out targeted optimizations all
year long, and now with Swift 2,

01:12:52.876 --> 01:12:56.036 A:middle
we have an all-new optimization
technology that's especially

01:12:56.036 --> 01:12:59.266 A:middle
great for complex applications
and object-oriented programming

01:12:59.506 --> 01:13:02.166 A:middle
that we call Whole
Module Optimization,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:12:59.506 --> 01:13:02.166 A:middle
that we call Whole
Module Optimization,

01:13:02.516 --> 01:13:04.736 A:middle
and the results are
really fantastic.

01:13:05.926 --> 01:13:08.556 A:middle
In addition, we are bringing
the language features

01:13:08.556 --> 01:13:10.196 A:middle
that you've asked for most,

01:13:10.456 --> 01:13:12.236 A:middle
an elegant new error
handling model,

01:13:12.616 --> 01:13:14.416 A:middle
the ability to see
your interfaces

01:13:14.416 --> 01:13:17.996 A:middle
as synthesized headers
in Xcode, and the feature

01:13:17.996 --> 01:13:22.346 A:middle
that Tim has been begging for
all year, protocol extensions.

01:13:22.486 --> 01:13:23.506 A:middle
You are all going to love it.

01:13:25.176 --> 01:13:30.646 A:middle
Now, we think Swift is the
next big programming language,

01:13:30.676 --> 01:13:32.846 A:middle
the one that we will
all be doing application

01:13:33.146 --> 01:13:37.026 A:middle
and systems programming
on for 20 years to come.

01:13:37.986 --> 01:13:42.916 A:middle
And we think Swift should be
everywhere and used by everyone,

01:13:43.576 --> 01:13:45.876 A:middle
and so we're going to be
doing something really big.

01:13:46.606 --> 01:13:50.666 A:middle
Today we are announcing that
Swift will be open source.

01:13:51.516 --> 01:14:14.406 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:14:14.906 --> 01:14:16.646 A:middle
We will be rolling
out the compiler

01:14:17.876 --> 01:14:21.836 A:middle
and the standard libraries
for iOS, OS X, and Linux.

01:14:22.986 --> 01:14:27.766 A:middle
And it will all be out there
by the end of the year.

01:14:28.606 --> 01:14:30.566 A:middle
So that's Swift,
and that is iOS 9.

01:14:30.566 --> 01:14:33.776 A:middle
We are doing a developer
beta -- you guessed it --

01:14:33.776 --> 01:14:36.916 A:middle
today, and for the first
time for a major iOS release,

01:14:36.956 --> 01:14:40.676 A:middle
a public beta, so sign
up now at beta.apple.com,

01:14:40.806 --> 01:14:43.056 A:middle
and you can get the beta
when it comes out in July.

01:14:43.136 --> 01:14:45.096 A:middle
And of course, we
will be rolling it

01:14:45.096 --> 01:14:46.776 A:middle
out as a free upgrade
in the fall.

01:14:47.176 --> 01:14:51.976 A:middle
And iOS 9 will support
all of the devices

01:14:51.976 --> 01:14:53.686 A:middle
that were supported by iOS 8.

01:14:53.686 --> 01:14:55.086 A:middle
We are not dropping
any this year

01:14:55.086 --> 01:14:57.676 A:middle
because we want everyone
to get iOS 9.

01:14:58.016 --> 01:14:59.916 A:middle
[Applause]

01:14:59.916 --> 01:15:00.506 A:middle
That's iOS 9.

01:14:59.916 --> 01:15:00.506 A:middle
That's iOS 9.

01:15:00.636 --> 01:15:02.496 A:middle
I really appreciate your time.

01:15:02.626 --> 01:15:03.446 A:middle
Have a fantastic conference.

01:15:03.446 --> 01:15:03.796 A:middle
Thank you.

01:15:04.516 --> 01:15:11.426 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:15:11.926 --> 01:15:12.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TIM COOK: Thanks, Craig.

01:15:15.056 --> 01:15:18.856 A:middle
iOS just keeps getting better
and better for our many hundreds

01:15:18.856 --> 01:15:22.166 A:middle
of millions of users,
and iOS 9 takes it

01:15:22.166 --> 01:15:25.176 A:middle
to an even greater level
with incredible new apps

01:15:25.176 --> 01:15:27.796 A:middle
and intelligence
built right into iOS.

01:15:28.426 --> 01:15:32.856 A:middle
And as an avid iPad user, I
am also incredibly excited

01:15:32.856 --> 01:15:37.796 A:middle
about how far it extends the
iPad experience as we continue

01:15:37.796 --> 01:15:39.256 A:middle
to lead in the post-PC era.

01:15:40.906 --> 01:15:44.426 A:middle
With El Capitan, we've
created a new version of OS X

01:15:44.796 --> 01:15:47.406 A:middle
that dramatically
improves the experience

01:15:47.966 --> 01:15:51.196 A:middle
and the user experience and the
performance of the Macintosh.

01:15:52.026 --> 01:15:53.196 A:middle
And of course, Swift.

01:15:53.906 --> 01:15:58.556 A:middle
You've just heard Swift provides
a single language for you

01:15:58.556 --> 01:16:02.846 A:middle
to create apps for
both OS X and iOS.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:15:58.556 --> 01:16:02.846 A:middle
to create apps for
both OS X and iOS.

01:16:04.206 --> 01:16:08.196 A:middle
There's really so many
possibilities for you

01:16:08.346 --> 01:16:11.826 A:middle
to use these platforms
and these tools

01:16:12.246 --> 01:16:16.346 A:middle
to create unbelievable apps
that will impact business

01:16:16.826 --> 01:16:21.246 A:middle
and healthcare and education and
really everything in our lives.

01:16:22.656 --> 01:16:26.806 A:middle
There's seemingly no
limit to what you can do.

01:16:27.746 --> 01:16:33.196 A:middle
And of course, underpinning
this, the App Store is very key.

01:16:34.276 --> 01:16:38.996 A:middle
It's hard to believe that the
App Store was launched only

01:16:39.136 --> 01:16:40.126 A:middle
seven years ago.

01:16:41.136 --> 01:16:43.036 A:middle
It's hard to remember
a day without it.

01:16:44.286 --> 01:16:45.826 A:middle
Now, I'm happy to announce

01:16:46.476 --> 01:16:50.926 A:middle
that the App Store recently
passed a major milestone.

01:16:51.476 --> 01:16:59.776 A:middle
The App Store has passed
100 billion apps downloads.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

[Applause]

01:17:07.396 --> 01:17:10.916 A:middle
The rate of growth
and the momentum is

01:17:10.916 --> 01:17:12.636 A:middle
absolutely staggering.

01:17:13.456 --> 01:17:16.346 A:middle
The industry has never seen
anything like this before.

01:17:17.296 --> 01:17:19.916 A:middle
The App Store has
forever changed software

01:17:19.916 --> 01:17:21.316 A:middle
and software distribution.

01:17:22.706 --> 01:17:25.746 A:middle
And it's also been
an economic boon.

01:17:26.446 --> 01:17:29.906 A:middle
We've now paid over $30
billion to developers.

01:17:30.516 --> 01:17:34.386 A:middle
[Applause]

01:17:34.886 --> 01:17:36.296 A:middle
The App Store continues

01:17:36.396 --> 01:17:42.816 A:middle
to be the most profitable app
marketplace on the planet.

01:17:42.936 --> 01:17:50.216 A:middle
Now, we could not be more proud
of the work that you are doing.

01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:55.346 A:middle
More and more, developers
are transforming, empowering,

01:17:55.896 --> 01:17:58.376 A:middle
and reimagining the
very important things

01:17:58.406 --> 01:18:00.256 A:middle
that we do in our daily lives.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:17:58.406 --> 01:18:00.256 A:middle
that we do in our daily lives.

01:18:01.536 --> 01:18:06.306 A:middle
We've made a video about
your incredible impact

01:18:07.106 --> 01:18:11.546 A:middle
and just how far you've come
in such a short period of time,

01:18:11.976 --> 01:18:13.466 A:middle
and I'd love to run
it for you now.

01:18:23.066 --> 01:18:25.786 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Eight years ago, when
the iPhone was launched,

01:18:25.786 --> 01:18:26.536 A:middle
it didn't have an App Store.

01:18:26.536 --> 01:18:32.286 A:middle
And there was tremendous desire
on the part of developers

01:18:32.286 --> 01:18:34.316 A:middle
and customers for Apple

01:18:34.316 --> 01:18:36.686 A:middle
to let third-party
applications be created.

01:18:36.686 --> 01:18:40.906 A:middle
We all had this dream
that apps were going

01:18:40.906 --> 01:18:45.276 A:middle
to become really important,
but it took some time

01:18:45.276 --> 01:18:48.396 A:middle
to realize how they would affect
everything that we care about,

01:18:48.396 --> 01:18:53.726 A:middle
and as that cumulative effect
appeared, then we all start

01:18:53.726 --> 01:18:55.866 A:middle
to realize, oh, my
goodness, this is bigger

01:18:55.866 --> 01:18:56.816 A:middle
than any of us imagined.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:19:04.496 --> 01:19:07.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Apps plus handheld devices,

01:19:07.096 --> 01:19:11.156 A:middle
I think that's a watershed
moment in civilization.

01:19:11.156 --> 01:19:12.656 A:middle
I put it up there
with the invention

01:19:12.656 --> 01:19:14.506 A:middle
of the microscope
and the telescope.

01:19:14.506 --> 01:19:21.876 A:middle
We live in a time where the most
powerful tools ever imagined

01:19:21.876 --> 01:19:25.866 A:middle
to investigate and probe
our world are in the hand

01:19:25.866 --> 01:19:26.926 A:middle
of essentially everyone.

01:19:29.146 --> 01:19:32.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; If you think the Industrial
Revolution was transformational,

01:19:32.116 --> 01:19:34.126 A:middle
the App Store is way bigger.

01:19:34.156 --> 01:19:37.396 A:middle
I don't think we've seen
anything reach a mass adoption

01:19:37.396 --> 01:19:38.736 A:middle
at anything close to this pace.

01:19:38.826 --> 01:19:42.656 A:middle
It took, for example,
electricity over a hundred years

01:19:42.656 --> 01:19:44.776 A:middle
to get to its first
50 million users.

01:19:45.046 --> 01:19:48.486 A:middle
It took television 13
years, and the App Store got

01:19:48.536 --> 01:19:49.976 A:middle
to 50 million users
in only 17 months.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:20:02.156 --> 01:20:04.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The thing the App
Store did was give each

01:20:04.556 --> 01:20:06.166 A:middle
and every developer a voice.

01:20:06.166 --> 01:20:09.776 A:middle
It's a testament that two
guys in a room working

01:20:09.816 --> 01:20:13.226 A:middle
on an idea can launch an app
and instantly have hundreds

01:20:13.226 --> 01:20:14.756 A:middle
of millions of people
very quickly.

01:20:14.756 --> 01:20:19.396 A:middle
The iPhone made photography
universally accessible.

01:20:26.046 --> 01:20:29.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I cannot think
of a single industry

01:20:29.206 --> 01:20:31.196 A:middle
that doesn't need an app.

01:20:31.196 --> 01:20:33.256 A:middle
People want data at
their fingertips.

01:20:33.256 --> 01:20:35.216 A:middle
They want personalized
experiences.

01:20:35.506 --> 01:20:38.836 A:middle
They want power over
their money.

01:20:38.836 --> 01:20:42.406 A:middle
And it's not just for banking;
it's for every industry.

01:20:42.406 --> 01:20:45.146 A:middle
The App Store has fundamentally
shifted how we all need

01:20:45.146 --> 01:20:45.656 A:middle
to deliver.

01:20:45.656 --> 01:20:47.976 A:middle
It's leveling the playing field.

01:20:52.046 --> 01:20:54.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; We don't have to own things.

01:20:54.736 --> 01:20:57.046 A:middle
We don't have to
own our own cars.

01:20:57.046 --> 01:20:59.126 A:middle
We don't have to
own our own music.

01:20:59.126 --> 01:21:02.836 A:middle
We can call it up
when we need it.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:20:59.126 --> 01:21:02.836 A:middle
We can call it up
when we need it.

01:21:02.836 --> 01:21:05.106 A:middle
That's a big change, all
flowing from the idea

01:21:05.106 --> 01:21:07.776 A:middle
of not just convenience
but people building

01:21:07.876 --> 01:21:10.306 A:middle
up an infrastructure
around that.

01:21:10.306 --> 01:21:13.546 A:middle
We are now talking
not about hundreds

01:21:13.546 --> 01:21:16.756 A:middle
of people getting the benefits
of an idea, but millions.

01:21:22.846 --> 01:21:25.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; If you had told me when I
was a kid that you would be able

01:21:25.346 --> 01:21:30.136 A:middle
to write an idea and then film
that idea and then distribute it

01:21:30.136 --> 01:21:32.306 A:middle
to the world on a device
that you could also put

01:21:32.306 --> 01:21:35.256 A:middle
in your pocket, I would
never have stopped laughing,

01:21:35.676 --> 01:21:36.626 A:middle
and I would have
thought you were insane.

01:21:38.446 --> 01:21:40.526 A:middle
The App Store gives
everyone access

01:21:40.706 --> 01:21:43.116 A:middle
to incredibly powerful tools,

01:21:44.656 --> 01:21:47.766 A:middle
and there's an incredible
generation of filmmakers

01:21:47.766 --> 01:21:48.606 A:middle
and storytellers to come.

01:21:59.096 --> 01:22:02.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Kids love technology,
and they love interacting

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

&gt;&gt; Kids love technology,

01:22:02.816 --> 01:22:06.456 A:middle
with the iPad and with apps.

01:22:06.456 --> 01:22:10.216 A:middle
That wonder and awe that gets
ignited is actually being

01:22:10.406 --> 01:22:13.596 A:middle
utilized to help
that person learn.

01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:15.796 A:middle
Certainly in education
there's so much potential

01:22:15.986 --> 01:22:18.256 A:middle
to take the classroom
with you anywhere.

01:22:23.046 --> 01:22:25.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; We all know we are
in this magic moment.

01:22:26.326 --> 01:22:30.716 A:middle
There are so many incredible
apps, and they do things

01:22:30.716 --> 01:22:32.976 A:middle
for people that change
their lives.

01:22:35.586 --> 01:22:37.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Music for me,
it's like everything.

01:22:37.766 --> 01:22:39.026 A:middle
It's really special.

01:22:39.026 --> 01:22:46.576 A:middle
This amazing feeling that
music gives me, I want everyone

01:22:46.686 --> 01:22:50.796 A:middle
to have that, even if
the person cannot hear.

01:22:50.796 --> 01:22:57.856 A:middle
So the idea of the app is to
introduce music for deaf people.

01:22:57.856 --> 01:23:03.546 A:middle

your wrist, so if you play,

My dream is to bring
music to everyone.

&gt;&gt; It is an amazing
time to be a developer.

01:23:30.276 --> 01:23:32.986 A:middle
We are still just at the
beginning of all this,

01:23:32.986 --> 01:23:37.096 A:middle
this moment where the technology
of an iPhone and an iPad

01:23:37.096 --> 01:23:40.876 A:middle
and the Watch enable so
many incredible things.

01:23:44.426 --> 01:23:47.106 A:middle
There's so much that can
still change and evolve due

01:23:47.106 --> 01:23:48.976 A:middle
to the power of applications.

And that's the opportunity to
bring native apps to the Watch

01:25:06.336 --> 01:25:08.816 A:middle
with a new version of watchOS.

01:25:09.516 --> 01:25:14.566 A:middle
[Applause]

01:25:15.066 --> 01:25:18.886 A:middle
For us, this is a giant moment.

01:25:20.306 --> 01:25:24.056 A:middle
This is how we felt when
we launched the App Store.

01:25:24.916 --> 01:25:27.306 A:middle
Opening a new platform
to developers

01:25:28.016 --> 01:25:31.916 A:middle
to create new applications

01:25:32.786 --> 01:25:34.826 A:middle
that can really change
people's lives.

01:25:36.346 --> 01:25:38.396 A:middle
We really believe
deeply in this space.

01:25:38.456 --> 01:25:41.486 A:middle
We believe in technology
designed for the wrist.

01:25:42.876 --> 01:25:45.156 A:middle
And we believe by
opening up the platform

01:25:45.156 --> 01:25:49.756 A:middle
that you will create
new and powerful uses

01:25:50.436 --> 01:25:52.956 A:middle
that today we can
only begin to imagine.

01:25:53.696 --> 01:25:59.266 A:middle
We began making the Apple Watch
available just six weeks ago,

01:25:59.266 --> 01:26:04.186 A:middle
and it's pretty amazing that
today we're already talking

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:25:59.266 --> 01:26:04.186 A:middle
and it's pretty amazing that
today we're already talking

01:26:04.186 --> 01:26:07.386 A:middle
about the next version
of the watchOS.

01:26:08.366 --> 01:26:12.536 A:middle
This new version will have
great new capabilities,

01:26:13.326 --> 01:26:16.556 A:middle
and it will bring native
apps right to your wrist.

01:26:17.706 --> 01:26:22.326 A:middle
To tell you all about it, I'd
like to invite up my friend

01:26:22.326 --> 01:26:24.576 A:middle
and colleague Kevin Lynch.

01:26:24.766 --> 01:26:24.976 A:middle
Kevin.

01:26:25.516 --> 01:26:29.856 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:26:30.356 --> 01:26:30.786 A:middle
&gt;&gt; KEVIN LYNCH: Hi.

01:26:33.496 --> 01:26:37.066 A:middle
So we're moving really fast on
watchOS, and I am super excited

01:26:37.066 --> 01:26:39.076 A:middle
to talk with you about the
enhancements that are coming

01:26:39.076 --> 01:26:40.606 A:middle
in watchOS, as well

01:26:40.606 --> 01:26:43.006 A:middle
as the powerful new
abilities for app development.

01:26:43.406 --> 01:26:44.836 A:middle
Let's start with
the enhancements.

01:26:45.836 --> 01:26:49.146 A:middle
The enhancements include
great new Timepiece functions,

01:26:49.526 --> 01:26:52.346 A:middle
improvements in communication
as well as in Health &amp; Fitness,

01:26:52.446 --> 01:26:54.226 A:middle
and support for the
new capabilities

01:26:54.226 --> 01:26:56.386 A:middle
in Apple Pay, Maps, and Siri.

01:26:56.886 --> 01:26:58.256 A:middle
Let's start with Timepiece.

01:26:59.076 --> 01:27:02.096 A:middle
Now, already, Apple Watch
is a really great timepiece,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:26:59.076 --> 01:27:02.096 A:middle
Now, already, Apple Watch
is a really great timepiece,

01:27:02.096 --> 01:27:04.776 A:middle
the most customizable one in the
world, and a lot of that is due

01:27:04.776 --> 01:27:06.776 A:middle
to the Watch faces and
how you can change them.

01:27:07.026 --> 01:27:09.436 A:middle
We are adding some new
Watch faces in watchOS 2.

01:27:10.196 --> 01:27:12.896 A:middle
That includes a beautiful
new Photos face to be able

01:27:12.896 --> 01:27:15.576 A:middle
to select any photo you have and
create a Watch face out of it.

01:27:15.576 --> 01:27:18.506 A:middle
You can create more than one and
switch between them as you like.

01:27:19.136 --> 01:27:20.616 A:middle
Or you can select a photo album,

01:27:20.896 --> 01:27:22.216 A:middle
and every time you
raise your wrist,

01:27:22.216 --> 01:27:24.506 A:middle
you will see a different
photo from your album show up.

01:27:24.506 --> 01:27:27.136 A:middle
It's a great way of seeing
your photos throughout the day.

01:27:27.696 --> 01:27:30.126 A:middle
We went a little
further with this,

01:27:30.126 --> 01:27:31.566 A:middle
and we shot some
photos ourselves.

01:27:31.566 --> 01:27:33.096 A:middle
We did some time-lapse
photography

01:27:33.096 --> 01:27:34.866 A:middle
in some beautiful
locations around the world.

01:27:35.656 --> 01:27:37.286 A:middle
The way this works is
when you raise your wrist,

01:27:37.566 --> 01:27:39.826 A:middle
you will see this
24-hour shoot we have done

01:27:39.826 --> 01:27:42.646 A:middle
in different locations, and it
will be the current time there.

01:27:42.646 --> 01:27:44.306 A:middle
If it's in noon, you
will see noon in London.

01:27:44.566 --> 01:27:46.596 A:middle
If it's night, you'll
see Big Ben all lit up.

01:27:46.916 --> 01:27:48.286 A:middle
We've done this not
only for London,

01:27:48.286 --> 01:27:49.596 A:middle
but some other locations too.

01:27:49.916 --> 01:27:52.116 A:middle
You can choose from
Hong Kong, Mack Lake --

01:27:52.116 --> 01:27:53.786 A:middle
which a beautiful
place in the Sierras --

01:27:53.786 --> 01:27:56.586 A:middle
as well as New York,
Shanghai, and London.

01:27:57.306 --> 01:28:00.146 A:middle
It's a great way to see really
beautiful imagery, both your own

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:27:57.306 --> 01:28:00.146 A:middle
It's a great way to see really
beautiful imagery, both your own

01:28:00.146 --> 01:28:01.886 A:middle
and these time-lapse
images, on your wrist.

01:28:01.886 --> 01:28:05.166 A:middle
You can customize your
Watch with these images

01:28:05.416 --> 01:28:07.516 A:middle
but you can also choose to
show the information that you

01:28:07.516 --> 01:28:10.056 A:middle
like on your Watch
face with something

01:28:10.056 --> 01:28:12.656 A:middle
in traditional Watch terms
that's called Complications.

01:28:13.396 --> 01:28:17.116 A:middle
With watchOS 2, we are really
excited to enable app developers

01:28:17.276 --> 01:28:18.866 A:middle
to make your own Complications.

01:28:19.516 --> 01:28:25.936 A:middle
[Applause]

01:28:26.436 --> 01:28:29.086 A:middle
So be able to do things
like show your flight time

01:28:29.086 --> 01:28:32.036 A:middle
from United, see the state
of your home control system,

01:28:32.316 --> 01:28:34.396 A:middle
look at the charge level
of your electric car,

01:28:34.596 --> 01:28:37.066 A:middle
or see sports scores, for
example, from the MLB app.

01:28:37.326 --> 01:28:38.896 A:middle
You can choose the
information that you most

01:28:38.896 --> 01:28:40.716 A:middle
like to see right
on your Watch face.

01:28:40.806 --> 01:28:42.246 A:middle
It's going to be
really, really cool.

01:28:42.596 --> 01:28:44.396 A:middle
And this will work not
only on the modular face

01:28:44.756 --> 01:28:47.136 A:middle
but across the others that
support Complications as well.

01:28:47.136 --> 01:28:49.546 A:middle
You will be able to choose
from a variety of templates,

01:28:49.546 --> 01:28:51.316 A:middle
and we'll make those
look beautiful in each

01:28:51.316 --> 01:28:52.456 A:middle
of the different Watch faces.

01:28:53.226 --> 01:28:54.616 A:middle
So it's going to be
a really fast way

01:28:54.616 --> 01:28:55.726 A:middle
to look at this information.

01:28:56.496 --> 01:28:57.596 A:middle
Now, we went further than this.

01:28:57.596 --> 01:28:59.256 A:middle
We thought it's really
great to be able

01:28:59.256 --> 01:29:00.486 A:middle
to see the current information,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:28:59.256 --> 01:29:00.486 A:middle
to see the current information,

01:29:00.936 --> 01:29:02.386 A:middle
but what about future
information,

01:29:02.386 --> 01:29:05.096 A:middle
like the weather later
today or your meeting

01:29:05.096 --> 01:29:06.566 A:middle
after the current one?

01:29:07.036 --> 01:29:09.226 A:middle
And what if you could go
forward in time and actually see

01:29:09.226 --> 01:29:11.076 A:middle
that information update
on your Watch face?

01:29:11.986 --> 01:29:13.756 A:middle
Well, we are supporting
that in watchOS 2

01:29:13.756 --> 01:29:15.806 A:middle
with something we
call Time Travel.

01:29:16.556 --> 01:29:18.866 A:middle
And you will be able to
rotate your Digital Crown,

01:29:18.866 --> 01:29:21.426 A:middle
and you can go both forward
and backward through time,

01:29:21.426 --> 01:29:23.886 A:middle
and the information will
update right on your screen.

01:29:24.546 --> 01:29:25.356 A:middle
Let's take a look here.

01:29:25.976 --> 01:29:28.536 A:middle
So I've got my meeting in
the middle there and weather

01:29:28.536 --> 01:29:30.656 A:middle
and the charge level of
the car and time in London.

01:29:31.006 --> 01:29:33.776 A:middle
When I rotate the Crown, you
can see it's changing the time

01:29:33.776 --> 01:29:35.276 A:middle
and showing me things
that are coming up.

01:29:36.006 --> 01:29:38.196 A:middle
Now, we know a really popular
one here might be the stocks

01:29:38.196 --> 01:29:40.046 A:middle
Complication, but we
haven't cracked that one yet.

01:29:40.366 --> 01:29:43.596 A:middle
We are working on it.

01:29:44.256 --> 01:29:46.206 A:middle
You can keep rotating,
keep going forward,

01:29:46.206 --> 01:29:47.186 A:middle
get all the way to tonight.

01:29:47.186 --> 01:29:49.436 A:middle
You can see I have a date
night tonight, weather is going

01:29:49.436 --> 01:29:52.116 A:middle
to be good, time in London will
be 2:00 a.m. You can see all the

01:29:52.116 --> 01:29:55.286 A:middle
information you like to see in
the time you want to look at it.

01:29:55.286 --> 01:29:57.416 A:middle
Really, really fun
way to interact

01:29:57.786 --> 01:29:59.186 A:middle
with time on your Watch.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:30:00.136 --> 01:30:01.976 A:middle
That's Time Travel.

01:30:02.516 --> 01:30:07.446 A:middle
[Applause]

01:30:07.946 --> 01:30:10.616 A:middle
Now, we also thought, What
would be a great experience

01:30:10.616 --> 01:30:12.676 A:middle
for the Watch when it's on
your nightstand and charging?

01:30:13.306 --> 01:30:15.406 A:middle
Well, we've come up with a
new user interface for this

01:30:15.406 --> 01:30:17.556 A:middle
in watchOS 2 called
Nightstand Mode.

01:30:18.036 --> 01:30:20.046 A:middle
When you put your Watch on
its side and it's charging,

01:30:20.246 --> 01:30:22.226 A:middle
you will get this beautiful
display now of the time,

01:30:22.706 --> 01:30:24.736 A:middle
and of course, you can set
an alarm that will wake you

01:30:24.736 --> 01:30:27.196 A:middle
up in the morning, and it
will go something like this.

01:30:28.241 --> 01:30:30.241 A:middle
[Alarm tone]

01:30:30.466 --> 01:30:32.536 A:middle
So a beautiful little
bedside alarm clock now

01:30:32.536 --> 01:30:35.116 A:middle
with Apple Watch, and
the buttons on the side

01:30:35.116 --> 01:30:38.666 A:middle
and the Crown act as your
Snooze and your Off button.

01:30:38.666 --> 01:30:41.776 A:middle
A really fun way to have a
Nightstand view on your Watch.

01:30:42.156 --> 01:30:44.866 A:middle
Those are some of the great
new Timepiece functions

01:30:44.866 --> 01:30:46.256 A:middle
that are coming in watchOS 2.

01:30:47.406 --> 01:30:48.526 A:middle
Let's look at communication.

01:30:49.016 --> 01:30:50.396 A:middle
Now, already Apple
Watch is great

01:30:50.396 --> 01:30:51.676 A:middle
at communicating
with your friends.

01:30:52.046 --> 01:30:55.076 A:middle
You can just press the side
button and see your 12 friends

01:30:55.076 --> 01:30:55.766 A:middle
that you have selected.

01:30:56.296 --> 01:30:58.236 A:middle
Now, we realize that some of
you have more than 12 friends,

01:30:58.586 --> 01:31:01.576 A:middle
so now in watchOS 2, you
can have different sets

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:30:58.586 --> 01:31:01.576 A:middle
so now in watchOS 2, you
can have different sets

01:31:01.576 --> 01:31:04.246 A:middle
of friends you can select,
and you can add a friend right

01:31:04.246 --> 01:31:05.906 A:middle
from your Watch by
pressing the plus sign

01:31:06.136 --> 01:31:07.606 A:middle
and add a friend right there.

01:31:08.766 --> 01:31:09.566 A:middle
Isn't that cool?

01:31:10.516 --> 01:31:13.086 A:middle
[Applause]

01:31:13.586 --> 01:31:14.746 A:middle
Now, when you are
communicating with someone,

01:31:14.746 --> 01:31:17.576 A:middle
you can make a phone call or
send a message or send a drawing

01:31:17.576 --> 01:31:20.676 A:middle
with Digital Touch, and now
in watchOS 2, you will be able

01:31:20.676 --> 01:31:22.546 A:middle
to use multiple colors
in your drawings,

01:31:22.546 --> 01:31:24.246 A:middle
so you can draw a
beautiful flower

01:31:24.496 --> 01:31:26.076 A:middle
that has more than
just one color.

01:31:26.886 --> 01:31:29.176 A:middle
Even my drawings are starting
to look better now with this.

01:31:30.396 --> 01:31:31.196 A:middle
Also an email.

01:31:31.256 --> 01:31:32.976 A:middle
You can already read
email on your Watch.

01:31:33.106 --> 01:31:35.976 A:middle
With watchOS 2, you will
be able to reply to email.

01:31:36.516 --> 01:31:40.546 A:middle
[Applause]

01:31:41.046 --> 01:31:42.926 A:middle
And with the phone, you can
already take phone calls

01:31:42.926 --> 01:31:43.476 A:middle
on your Watch.

01:31:43.476 --> 01:31:45.476 A:middle
We are now going to
support FaceTime Audio,

01:31:45.476 --> 01:31:47.526 A:middle
so you will get really
high-fidelity calls right

01:31:47.526 --> 01:31:47.976 A:middle
on your wrist.

01:31:48.516 --> 01:31:52.816 A:middle
[Applause]

01:31:53.316 --> 01:31:54.376 A:middle
And with Health &amp; Fitness,

01:31:54.886 --> 01:31:57.366 A:middle
already Apple Watch is a great
partner for Health &amp; Fitness.

01:31:57.806 --> 01:32:01.206 A:middle
With watchOS 2, we are enabling
your favorite fitness apps

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:31:57.806 --> 01:32:01.206 A:middle
With watchOS 2, we are enabling
your favorite fitness apps

01:32:01.206 --> 01:32:02.816 A:middle
to run natively on the Watch

01:32:02.816 --> 01:32:05.836 A:middle
so you can use them wherever
you are, and your workouts

01:32:05.836 --> 01:32:07.936 A:middle
with these apps will
contribute directly

01:32:07.936 --> 01:32:10.306 A:middle
to your all-day activity,
which will be really great,

01:32:10.306 --> 01:32:11.656 A:middle
so if you go on a bike
ride, it will count.

01:32:12.516 --> 01:32:14.926 A:middle
[Applause]

01:32:15.426 --> 01:32:17.876 A:middle
We are also enabling
Siri to start workouts,

01:32:17.876 --> 01:32:20.076 A:middle
so you can just raise your
wrist and say, hey, Siri,

01:32:20.076 --> 01:32:21.466 A:middle
start a 30-minute
run in the park,

01:32:21.466 --> 01:32:24.076 A:middle
and it will start the Workout
app and get it going for you.

01:32:24.536 --> 01:32:27.866 A:middle
You can also say things like
"go for a 300-calorie bike ride"

01:32:28.146 --> 01:32:31.436 A:middle
or "go for a 5-mile run, "
and it will start the workout

01:32:31.436 --> 01:32:32.976 A:middle
for you without having to
touch the watch at all.

01:32:33.496 --> 01:32:35.036 A:middle
When you achieve something,

01:32:35.036 --> 01:32:37.296 A:middle
there are some beautiful new
achievements you will see

01:32:37.646 --> 01:32:38.526 A:middle
that look like this.

01:32:39.116 --> 01:32:40.886 A:middle
They spin right in, they're
beautiful, you can play

01:32:40.886 --> 01:32:42.746 A:middle
with them in 3D on the
Watch, they are engraved

01:32:42.746 --> 01:32:45.896 A:middle
on the back now with your
name, and you can share these

01:32:45.896 --> 01:32:48.756 A:middle
with people over Messages,
Facebook, or Twitter.

01:32:48.996 --> 01:32:52.376 A:middle
Really cool Health &amp; Fitness.

01:32:53.516 --> 01:32:56.356 A:middle
[Applause]

01:32:56.856 --> 01:32:58.366 A:middle
With Apple Pay, you saw some

01:32:58.366 --> 01:33:00.066 A:middle
of the great new
support we are bringing

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:32:58.366 --> 01:33:00.066 A:middle
of the great new
support we are bringing

01:33:00.066 --> 01:33:01.536 A:middle
for store cards and
rewards cards.

01:33:01.536 --> 01:33:03.126 A:middle
We are supporting
that in the Watch,

01:33:03.126 --> 01:33:05.726 A:middle
so you can select a store card
and use it right in your Watch

01:33:05.726 --> 01:33:07.836 A:middle
in a merchant terminal
just by waving it

01:33:07.836 --> 01:33:08.986 A:middle
at the store stand there.

01:33:08.986 --> 01:33:11.686 A:middle
And with Wallet coming to Watch,

01:33:11.836 --> 01:33:13.596 A:middle
all of your rewards cards
will be right there,

01:33:13.596 --> 01:33:15.546 A:middle
and you can also use those
right from your Watch

01:33:15.546 --> 01:33:16.446 A:middle
as you are doing purchases.

01:33:17.396 --> 01:33:19.696 A:middle
With Transit, we are
supporting, of course,

01:33:19.696 --> 01:33:22.486 A:middle
the mass transit capabilities
in Maps now, so you will be able

01:33:22.486 --> 01:33:23.976 A:middle
to see the transit
lines on your wrist.

01:33:24.366 --> 01:33:25.986 A:middle
You can actually see
the departure times

01:33:25.986 --> 01:33:27.186 A:middle
for different stations
you are near.

01:33:27.596 --> 01:33:30.016 A:middle
When you are navigating, you
will get step-by-step directions

01:33:30.296 --> 01:33:32.326 A:middle
about getting through the
different mass transit you use.

01:33:33.296 --> 01:33:36.156 A:middle
With Siri, we are continuing
to add new domains for Siri.

01:33:36.466 --> 01:33:38.646 A:middle
In watchOS 2, we
are enabling Siri

01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:41.046 A:middle
to get you mass transit
directions, like bus directions

01:33:41.046 --> 01:33:42.806 A:middle
to the Ferry Building,
which will look like this

01:33:42.806 --> 01:33:44.076 A:middle
and you can just
start navigating.

01:33:44.506 --> 01:33:46.866 A:middle
Or you can control things
in your home with Siri,

01:33:47.266 --> 01:33:49.946 A:middle
you can say things like "hey
Siri set the dinner scene,"

01:33:49.946 --> 01:33:52.406 A:middle
and it will talk to any
HomeKit-enabled devices

01:33:52.406 --> 01:33:54.906 A:middle
in your house and set the
lights just how you want them.

01:33:55.386 --> 01:33:57.136 A:middle
Isn't that cool?

01:33:57.686 --> 01:33:58.926 A:middle
It's going to be great.

01:33:59.516 --> 01:34:02.546 A:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:33:59.516 --> 01:34:02.546 A:middle
[Applause]

01:34:03.046 --> 01:34:05.216 A:middle
Another great thing is you
can actually ask for any

01:34:05.216 --> 01:34:07.846 A:middle
of the Glances you have,
so you can say "hey, Siri,

01:34:07.846 --> 01:34:10.026 A:middle
show me the Instagram
Glance," and it will show

01:34:10.026 --> 01:34:11.036 A:middle
up right on your Watch face.

01:34:11.346 --> 01:34:13.586 A:middle
This could be a glance you
don't have currently selected.

01:34:13.866 --> 01:34:15.716 A:middle
It's a great way
to show information

01:34:15.716 --> 01:34:17.876 A:middle
from third-party apps
right there in Siri.

01:34:19.296 --> 01:34:20.716 A:middle
So those are just
some of the highlights

01:34:20.716 --> 01:34:22.146 A:middle
of what's coming in watchOS 2.

01:34:22.146 --> 01:34:23.146 A:middle
We think it's going
to be a really,

01:34:23.146 --> 01:34:24.686 A:middle
really great update
to the Watch.

01:34:26.266 --> 01:34:26.936 A:middle
Now, that's not all.

01:34:27.516 --> 01:34:30.956 A:middle
[Applause]

01:34:31.456 --> 01:34:34.356 A:middle
We also, of course, focused on
what we can do for developers,

01:34:34.736 --> 01:34:37.686 A:middle
and already, out of the gate
on day one, you can build apps

01:34:37.716 --> 01:34:40.026 A:middle
for Apple Watch using
something called WatchKit,

01:34:40.026 --> 01:34:43.826 A:middle
and that has enabled many
thousands of apps now

01:34:43.946 --> 01:34:47.036 A:middle
to be created for Apple Watch,
and these apps today function

01:34:47.196 --> 01:34:48.336 A:middle
by relying on your phone.

01:34:48.816 --> 01:34:50.786 A:middle
So you might have, for
example, an app on your Watch

01:34:50.966 --> 01:34:52.696 A:middle
and the user interface
runs on your phone

01:34:53.036 --> 01:34:55.676 A:middle
and the user interface is on
your Watch, but all the logic

01:34:55.676 --> 01:34:57.826 A:middle
for your app today
runs on your phone.

01:34:58.126 --> 01:35:00.676 A:middle
With native apps, you will
be able to move that logic

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:34:58.126 --> 01:35:00.676 A:middle
With native apps, you will
be able to move that logic

01:35:00.746 --> 01:35:03.456 A:middle
to the watch so both the
UI and the logic are there,

01:35:03.456 --> 01:35:06.006 A:middle
it will all run locally,
performance will be great,

01:35:06.096 --> 01:35:07.266 A:middle
responsiveness will be great,

01:35:07.266 --> 01:35:09.776 A:middle
it's going to be a great new
frontier for apps on Apple Watch

01:35:09.816 --> 01:35:10.926 A:middle
with native app support.

01:35:11.516 --> 01:35:17.476 A:middle
[Applause]

01:35:17.976 --> 01:35:20.486 A:middle
When you are actually wandering
away from your phone sometimes,

01:35:20.876 --> 01:35:22.436 A:middle
your apps will be able
to communicate directly

01:35:22.436 --> 01:35:24.276 A:middle
with the network with
known Wi-Fi networks,

01:35:24.476 --> 01:35:26.466 A:middle
so you can get the information
you want wherever you are

01:35:26.466 --> 01:35:27.186 A:middle
with your Watch.

01:35:28.516 --> 01:35:32.196 A:middle
[Applause]

01:35:32.696 --> 01:35:34.816 A:middle
So we heard from you as we
were working on native apps,

01:35:34.816 --> 01:35:36.616 A:middle
a lot of feature requests
of things you would

01:35:36.616 --> 01:35:37.556 A:middle
like to do on the Watch.

01:35:37.766 --> 01:35:39.256 A:middle
These are a bunch of the
things that we've heard.

01:35:39.746 --> 01:35:40.916 A:middle
So we've been listening to that.

01:35:41.216 --> 01:35:42.816 A:middle
Let's go through
some of the things

01:35:42.816 --> 01:35:44.996 A:middle
that will be possible
now in watchOS 2.

01:35:44.996 --> 01:35:45.846 A:middle
You can see how we did on this.

01:35:46.386 --> 01:35:48.806 A:middle
So one of the things we
heard was really wanted

01:35:48.806 --> 01:35:50.816 A:middle
to access the microphone
on the Watch.

01:35:51.346 --> 01:35:54.146 A:middle
So yes, in watchOS 2, you can
access the microphone right

01:35:54.146 --> 01:35:56.546 A:middle
on the Watch and bring that
audio right into your app.

01:35:57.516 --> 01:36:00.046 A:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:35:57.516 --> 01:36:00.046 A:middle
[Applause]

01:36:00.546 --> 01:36:02.606 A:middle
We also heard you want to
play audio out of the speaker.

01:36:02.976 --> 01:36:03.646 A:middle
You can do that.

01:36:03.646 --> 01:36:05.636 A:middle
WatchOS 2 with native
apps, you can play back

01:36:05.636 --> 01:36:07.996 A:middle
through the Watch speaker
or you can play audio

01:36:08.226 --> 01:36:10.286 A:middle
to a Bluetooth headset
or speaker connected,

01:36:10.286 --> 01:36:12.136 A:middle
both short-form and
long-form audio.

01:36:12.666 --> 01:36:14.406 A:middle
Video. We know you
wanted to play video.

01:36:14.406 --> 01:36:16.816 A:middle
You can play back short-form
video right on the Watch face.

01:36:16.816 --> 01:36:18.756 A:middle
It looks beautiful
on the Watch display.

01:36:19.866 --> 01:36:20.966 A:middle
Access to HealthKit.

01:36:21.456 --> 01:36:22.436 A:middle
We definitely heard that.

01:36:22.756 --> 01:36:25.156 A:middle
You now will have access,
native HealthKit on the watch,

01:36:25.496 --> 01:36:28.186 A:middle
including streaming heart rate
data, so if you are doing,

01:36:28.186 --> 01:36:29.996 A:middle
for example, a bike
ride with Strava,

01:36:29.996 --> 01:36:32.306 A:middle
you can see what heart rate zone
you are in while you are biking.

01:36:33.516 --> 01:36:38.396 A:middle
[Applause]

01:36:38.896 --> 01:36:41.546 A:middle
HomeKit is natively on the Watch
so you will be able to talk

01:36:41.546 --> 01:36:43.826 A:middle
to your HomeKit devices from
your Watch and control them.

01:36:44.056 --> 01:36:45.516 A:middle
We think this is going
to be a great future

01:36:45.516 --> 01:36:46.776 A:middle
for control right
from your wrist.

01:36:46.776 --> 01:36:49.536 A:middle
You will be able to
access the Accelerometer

01:36:49.536 --> 01:36:50.706 A:middle
so you can get movement data.

01:36:51.036 --> 01:36:53.986 A:middle
So for example, from the iPING
golf app here, you can check

01:36:53.986 --> 01:36:55.686 A:middle
out your golf swing tempo

01:36:55.686 --> 01:36:58.066 A:middle
as you are swinging the golf
club with your Watch on.

01:36:59.336 --> 01:37:02.486 A:middle
Taptic Engine is one of the
things we've really done a lot

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:36:59.336 --> 01:37:02.486 A:middle
Taptic Engine is one of the
things we've really done a lot

01:37:02.486 --> 01:37:04.746 A:middle
of focused work on to make it a
great experience on the wrist.

01:37:05.136 --> 01:37:07.626 A:middle
We are bringing access to
the Taptic Engine for you

01:37:07.676 --> 01:37:08.696 A:middle
for your app development.

01:37:09.136 --> 01:37:11.436 A:middle
You will be able to choose from
a range of different feelings

01:37:11.706 --> 01:37:13.706 A:middle
as well as audio that
will come out the speaker.

01:37:14.096 --> 01:37:16.406 A:middle
So for example, if I am
unlocking my car here,

01:37:16.406 --> 01:37:19.226 A:middle
I will get feedback on my
wrist, both audio and felt.

01:37:19.516 --> 01:37:20.866 A:middle
Just like that.

01:37:22.296 --> 01:37:25.276 A:middle
Another great interaction on the
Watch is using the Digital Crown

01:37:25.306 --> 01:37:28.636 A:middle
to manipulate the UI, and we are
enabling access to Digital Crown

01:37:28.636 --> 01:37:29.806 A:middle
as well with watchOS 2.

01:37:29.806 --> 01:37:32.746 A:middle
You will be able to
control custom UI element

01:37:32.746 --> 01:37:34.446 A:middle
like changing the
temperature here just

01:37:34.446 --> 01:37:35.756 A:middle
by rotating the Crown like this.

01:37:36.446 --> 01:37:38.366 A:middle
Super easy way to
interact with your Watch.

01:37:39.516 --> 01:37:44.266 A:middle
[Applause]

01:37:44.766 --> 01:37:46.736 A:middle
So we've done a great job
bringing a lot of access

01:37:46.736 --> 01:37:48.186 A:middle
to the Watch now
with native apps.

01:37:48.186 --> 01:37:50.016 A:middle
I would like to show you a
demo now with some examples.

01:37:51.516 --> 01:37:55.636 A:middle
[Applause]

01:37:56.136 --> 01:37:58.606 A:middle
So I've got a Watch here,
and I am going to put it on.

01:37:59.086 --> 01:38:01.806 A:middle
It's connected to the display
here through this little cable.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:37:59.086 --> 01:38:01.806 A:middle
It's connected to the display
here through this little cable.

01:38:02.376 --> 01:38:02.766 A:middle
All right.

01:38:04.166 --> 01:38:08.436 A:middle
Let's start by looking at
three examples of new features

01:38:08.436 --> 01:38:10.636 A:middle
in watchOS 2, then I
will show you three apps.

01:38:11.386 --> 01:38:13.476 A:middle
Let's start with
making a photo face,

01:38:13.476 --> 01:38:17.276 A:middle
so I will press my Digital Crown
here, go to the Home screen.

01:38:17.586 --> 01:38:18.476 A:middle
There's my Photos.

01:38:18.476 --> 01:38:21.496 A:middle
You can see I've got a
bunch of photos on here.

01:38:21.496 --> 01:38:23.496 A:middle
I can zoom in with
the Crown, pan around,

01:38:23.926 --> 01:38:25.046 A:middle
and I can pick a photo

01:38:25.046 --> 01:38:27.106 A:middle
that might make a nice
Watch face like that one.

01:38:27.616 --> 01:38:29.086 A:middle
I want to zoom in and
crop it a little more.

01:38:29.086 --> 01:38:31.376 A:middle
I am going to zoom in a
little more, move it over like

01:38:31.436 --> 01:38:32.446 A:middle
that to get it just right.

01:38:32.736 --> 01:38:34.186 A:middle
I think that's going to
make a great Watch face,

01:38:34.816 --> 01:38:37.736 A:middle
so I just Force Touch,
choose Create Watch Face,

01:38:38.426 --> 01:38:39.976 A:middle
and there you go, a
beautiful new Watch face.

01:38:40.516 --> 01:38:45.446 A:middle
[Applause]

01:38:45.946 --> 01:38:46.806 A:middle
Let's look at Time Travel.

01:38:46.806 --> 01:38:48.446 A:middle
I will go over to
my modular face,

01:38:48.576 --> 01:38:49.716 A:middle
got some more information here.

01:38:50.096 --> 01:38:51.596 A:middle
I have flight times
here on United.

01:38:51.846 --> 01:38:53.146 A:middle
I can see the temperature,

01:38:53.146 --> 01:38:56.156 A:middle
my VW car's charge
level, and time in London.

01:38:56.426 --> 01:38:58.936 A:middle
So I just rotate the Crown
here, I can go forward in time.

01:38:59.786 --> 01:39:00.806 A:middle
Time is updating.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:38:59.786 --> 01:39:00.806 A:middle
Time is updating.

01:39:01.056 --> 01:39:03.286 A:middle
My flight is leaving,
you can see, at 1:45.

01:39:03.286 --> 01:39:06.036 A:middle
I wonder if my charge level will
be enough to get to the airport.

01:39:06.266 --> 01:39:09.776 A:middle
So if I keep going forward in
time here, we will get to 1:45,

01:39:09.776 --> 01:39:11.856 A:middle
and you can see my charge
level is just going to be great

01:39:11.856 --> 01:39:12.676 A:middle
to get to the airport.

01:39:13.316 --> 01:39:15.366 A:middle
In fact, you can keep going
and look at boarding time

01:39:15.366 --> 01:39:16.586 A:middle
and arrival time
for your flight.

01:39:16.586 --> 01:39:18.606 A:middle
So you can get a great
preview of your day just

01:39:18.606 --> 01:39:20.616 A:middle
by rotating the Crown
right on the Watch face.

01:39:20.616 --> 01:39:21.966 A:middle
It's a lot of fun.

01:39:22.936 --> 01:39:25.576 A:middle
Just press the Crown
and go back to Home.

01:39:25.576 --> 01:39:28.686 A:middle
If you get an email, you can
reply to email now in watchOS 2.

01:39:29.096 --> 01:39:31.516 A:middle
Here is an email that's
just come in from Marc.

01:39:32.746 --> 01:39:35.326 A:middle
I can reply to this by pressing
the button right below the

01:39:35.326 --> 01:39:37.736 A:middle
message, or you can
use Siri to reply

01:39:37.736 --> 01:39:39.696 A:middle
to a message right
from a notification.

01:39:40.186 --> 01:39:44.966 A:middle
If I just use Siri here,
I can reply like this.

01:39:45.176 --> 01:39:52.916 A:middle
Reply: I would love to.

01:39:53.176 --> 01:39:55.306 A:middle
So Siri is making
the message there.

01:39:55.306 --> 01:39:56.666 A:middle
It's created a response.

01:39:56.666 --> 01:39:58.966 A:middle
I just press Send, and
it now goes off to Marc.

01:39:59.496 --> 01:40:01.456 A:middle
So just by pressing the
Crown, you can use Siri

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:39:59.496 --> 01:40:01.456 A:middle
So just by pressing the
Crown, you can use Siri

01:40:01.456 --> 01:40:03.486 A:middle
to send a message
right from your wrist.

01:40:03.916 --> 01:40:05.756 A:middle
Now, let's look at a
few third-party apps.

01:40:05.756 --> 01:40:08.286 A:middle
Let's look at the VW app you
saw on slides a second ago.

01:40:08.756 --> 01:40:10.176 A:middle
I will show you how that works.

01:40:10.906 --> 01:40:13.326 A:middle
Here it is.

01:40:13.536 --> 01:40:14.956 A:middle
Now, I can lock my car just

01:40:14.956 --> 01:40:16.636 A:middle
by pressing this
control right here.

01:40:16.636 --> 01:40:18.606 A:middle
It responds right away.

01:40:18.606 --> 01:40:20.286 A:middle
You can see the app also
opened very quickly.

01:40:20.286 --> 01:40:22.126 A:middle
And I can control
the temperature here

01:40:22.126 --> 01:40:24.656 A:middle
that we were looking at before
by just rotating the Crown.

01:40:24.656 --> 01:40:26.586 A:middle
You can see how responsive
it is as I go up and down

01:40:26.586 --> 01:40:27.356 A:middle
through temperatures here.

01:40:27.356 --> 01:40:28.576 A:middle
Really, really cool.

01:40:28.576 --> 01:40:30.616 A:middle
I will get it nice and warm for
me so when I get down there,

01:40:30.616 --> 01:40:31.966 A:middle
it will be nice and toasty.

01:40:31.966 --> 01:40:32.966 A:middle
Okay. Turn it on.

01:40:32.966 --> 01:40:35.026 A:middle
All right.

01:40:35.026 --> 01:40:37.086 A:middle
I've got confirmation
that it actually enabled

01:40:37.086 --> 01:40:38.636 A:middle
that on my car now.

01:40:38.636 --> 01:40:41.066 A:middle
Access to the mic is going
to be really helpful in apps,

01:40:41.406 --> 01:40:43.396 A:middle
and some of the apps that will
really benefit are communication

01:40:43.396 --> 01:40:44.496 A:middle
apps like We Chat.

01:40:44.766 --> 01:40:47.936 A:middle
A lot of messages sent via
WeChat are audio messages,

01:40:47.936 --> 01:40:50.686 A:middle
so let's see how that
will work with watchOS 2.

01:40:51.186 --> 01:40:53.336 A:middle
I have a message from Becky.

01:40:53.676 --> 01:40:56.526 A:middle
I can reply by pressing
the Reply button,

01:40:56.636 --> 01:40:58.206 A:middle
and you can see I've
got a microphone now

01:40:58.206 --> 01:40:59.556 A:middle
so I can do an audio response.

01:40:59.946 --> 01:41:01.246 A:middle
Let's do that.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:40:59.946 --> 01:41:01.246 A:middle
Let's do that.

01:41:04.236 --> 01:41:05.326 A:middle
That sounds great.

01:41:05.326 --> 01:41:09.016 A:middle
You can see as I was recording
it, it got the audio levels

01:41:09.016 --> 01:41:11.126 A:middle
of my voice and now
it sent that to Becky.

01:41:11.576 --> 01:41:13.296 A:middle
I can also reply
with stickers here.

01:41:13.296 --> 01:41:14.926 A:middle
There's different
categories of them.

01:41:15.316 --> 01:41:18.716 A:middle
With the Digital Crown now
being able to connect to the UI,

01:41:18.716 --> 01:41:22.136 A:middle
I can flip through recent
stickers, pick one quickly

01:41:22.136 --> 01:41:24.346 A:middle
that I like, and just
send that one as well.

01:41:24.836 --> 01:41:26.296 A:middle
So very fast to interact now

01:41:26.526 --> 01:41:29.796 A:middle
with all these new controls you
have available in watchOS 2.

01:41:29.796 --> 01:41:31.856 A:middle
Now, let's look at
the Vine glance.

01:41:32.316 --> 01:41:35.926 A:middle
Vine is a great example of
playing back video on the Watch,

01:41:36.376 --> 01:41:39.086 A:middle
and its format is really
perfect for the Watch face.

01:41:39.766 --> 01:41:41.726 A:middle
Here is a recent one on Vine.

01:41:50.796 --> 01:41:52.506 A:middle
So that's video playing back
right on the Watch face.

01:41:52.536 --> 01:41:54.986 A:middle
So those are just some
examples of what you can do now

01:41:55.176 --> 01:41:57.346 A:middle
with watchOS 2, and
I am super excited

01:41:57.346 --> 01:41:58.876 A:middle
to see what all you guys
do with all this stuff.

01:41:59.516 --> 01:42:07.486 A:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:41:59.516 --> 01:42:07.486 A:middle
[Applause]

01:42:07.986 --> 01:42:09.456 A:middle
So some great new
enhancements coming,

01:42:09.456 --> 01:42:12.396 A:middle
as well as some super powerful
app development tools for you.

01:42:12.666 --> 01:42:14.456 A:middle
And we've been working
really hard on this,

01:42:14.566 --> 01:42:17.406 A:middle
and I am really happy to say
that this stuff is all available

01:42:17.406 --> 01:42:19.936 A:middle
to you today to start
building these native apps.

01:42:20.516 --> 01:42:24.206 A:middle
[Applause]

01:42:24.706 --> 01:42:27.016 A:middle
Just six weeks from our
launch, it's unbelievable.

01:42:27.016 --> 01:42:30.356 A:middle
Then it will be available
in the fall to everyone,

01:42:30.356 --> 01:42:31.916 A:middle
and we will work
across all the watches,

01:42:31.916 --> 01:42:33.766 A:middle
of course, and it will be free.

01:42:34.416 --> 01:42:36.076 A:middle
So this has been
a great adventure.

01:42:36.076 --> 01:42:37.916 A:middle
We are just getting
started here,

01:42:38.076 --> 01:42:40.226 A:middle
and I am really looking forward
to the journey ahead with all

01:42:40.226 --> 01:42:41.296 A:middle
of you on Apple Watch.

01:42:41.536 --> 01:42:42.146 A:middle
Thank you very much.

01:42:42.356 --> 01:42:42.746 A:middle
Back to Tim.

01:42:43.381 --> 01:42:45.381 A:middle
[Applause]

01:42:45.746 --> 01:42:46.426 A:middle
Thank you, Tim.

01:42:46.426 --> 01:42:50.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TIM COOK: Thanks, Kevin.

01:42:50.536 --> 01:42:53.146 A:middle
We're really excited to have
Apple Watch out in the world,

01:42:53.146 --> 01:42:56.066 A:middle
and we can't wait to see
what you do with watchOS.

01:42:57.216 --> 01:43:00.996 A:middle
And we couldn't be more
excited about how developers

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:42:57.216 --> 01:43:00.996 A:middle
And we couldn't be more
excited about how developers

01:43:01.096 --> 01:43:05.476 A:middle
and users will use the powerful
ecosystems of both products

01:43:05.766 --> 01:43:10.356 A:middle
and platforms, three
amazing platforms.

01:43:11.266 --> 01:43:13.726 A:middle
The opportunities
really are limitless.

01:43:15.276 --> 01:43:23.916 A:middle
Now, before we close this
morning, we do have ...

01:43:25.296 --> 01:43:25.976 A:middle
one more thing.

01:43:26.516 --> 01:43:32.526 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:43:33.026 --> 01:43:34.556 A:middle
I'd like to tell
you about something

01:43:35.606 --> 01:43:37.816 A:middle
that we've been working
really hard on

01:43:37.816 --> 01:43:40.326 A:middle
and something we are
super excited about.

01:43:41.306 --> 01:43:46.216 A:middle
You know, we love music, and
music is such an important part

01:43:46.286 --> 01:43:49.346 A:middle
of our lives and our culture.

01:43:50.366 --> 01:43:53.266 A:middle
We've had a long relationship
with music at Apple,

01:43:54.686 --> 01:43:58.056 A:middle
and music has had a very
rich history of change,

01:43:58.326 --> 01:43:59.856 A:middle
some of which we've
played a part in.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

We've made a great video
about the history of music,

01:44:04.776 --> 01:44:07.396 A:middle
and I would like to play
it for you this morning.

01:44:14.516 --> 01:45:41.516 A:middle
[Music]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:45:42.016 --> 01:45:47.000 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:45:47.616 --> 01:45:50.456 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TIM COOK: Today we're
announcing Apple Music,

01:45:50.636 --> 01:45:54.766 A:middle
the next chapter in music, and
I know you are going to love it.

01:45:55.256 --> 01:45:58.606 A:middle
It will change the way that
you experience music forever.

01:45:59.816 --> 01:46:03.526 A:middle
To tell you more about it,
I'd like to bring up someone

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:45:59.816 --> 01:46:03.526 A:middle
To tell you more about it,
I'd like to bring up someone

01:46:04.146 --> 01:46:05.976 A:middle
who knows more about music

01:46:06.186 --> 01:46:09.316 A:middle
and the music experience
than anyone I know.

01:46:10.376 --> 01:46:14.326 A:middle
He's worked with amazing
artists from Bruce Springsteen

01:46:14.966 --> 01:46:17.756 A:middle
to John Lennon and
countless others.

01:46:18.456 --> 01:46:21.756 A:middle
We are thrilled to have him
a part of the Apple team.

01:46:22.626 --> 01:46:25.066 A:middle
Please join me in
welcoming Jimmy Iovine.

01:46:25.066 --> 01:46:25.436 A:middle
Jimmy.

01:46:26.516 --> 01:46:34.556 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:46:35.056 --> 01:46:35.696 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JIMMY IOVINE: Thanks, Tim.

01:46:36.756 --> 01:46:39.156 A:middle
Well, it's really
an honor to be here.

01:46:39.156 --> 01:46:41.186 A:middle
I'm here because in 2003,

01:46:41.186 --> 01:46:44.916 A:middle
the record industry was
a ball of confusion.

01:46:45.076 --> 01:46:49.406 A:middle
We had Napster, we had
LimeWire, we had BitTorrent.

01:46:50.406 --> 01:46:53.686 A:middle
This giant invader from
the north, technology.

01:46:54.816 --> 01:46:57.236 A:middle
I'm looking at my guys saying,
well, what do we do with this?

01:46:58.516 --> 01:47:01.796 A:middle
So I go up to Apple, and I
see Steve Jobs and Eddy Cue,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:46:58.516 --> 01:47:01.796 A:middle
So I go up to Apple, and I
see Steve Jobs and Eddy Cue,

01:47:01.796 --> 01:47:06.766 A:middle
and they showed me something
brilliant and groundbreaking,

01:47:07.026 --> 01:47:12.536 A:middle
a simple, elegant way to
buy music online, iTunes.

01:47:13.806 --> 01:47:17.866 A:middle
I'm like, wow, the ads are real.

01:47:18.236 --> 01:47:20.326 A:middle
These guys really
do think different.

01:47:21.446 --> 01:47:28.016 A:middle
[Laughter] So they could help
move culture the same way

01:47:28.156 --> 01:47:29.726 A:middle
that art moves culture.

01:47:30.756 --> 01:47:37.746 A:middle
Technology and art can work
together, at least at Apple.

01:47:37.976 --> 01:47:43.776 A:middle
So now 2015, music industry
is a fragmented mess.

01:47:44.766 --> 01:47:48.486 A:middle
If you want to stream
music, you can go over here.

01:47:48.486 --> 01:47:51.486 A:middle
If you want to stream
some video,

01:47:52.206 --> 01:47:54.036 A:middle
you can check some
of these places out.

01:47:54.736 --> 01:47:56.256 A:middle
If you want to follow
some artist,

01:47:56.726 --> 01:47:59.676 A:middle
there's more confusion for that.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:48:01.116 --> 01:48:05.556 A:middle
So I reached out to Tim Cook
and Eddy Cue, and I said guys,

01:48:06.106 --> 01:48:12.436 A:middle
can we build a bigger and better
ecosystem with the elegance

01:48:12.436 --> 01:48:15.416 A:middle
and simplicity that
only Apple can do?

01:48:16.746 --> 01:48:20.666 A:middle
One complete thought
around music.

01:48:21.696 --> 01:48:25.276 A:middle
And from that, I'm
standing here today so proud

01:48:25.276 --> 01:48:29.016 A:middle
of everyone that's worked
so hard, and I am going

01:48:29.016 --> 01:48:31.046 A:middle
to introduce you to Apple Music.

01:48:32.516 --> 01:48:36.546 A:middle
[Applause]

01:48:37.046 --> 01:48:39.136 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Music has such
power in our lives.

01:48:39.136 --> 01:48:40.846 A:middle
The way we listen to

01:48:40.846 --> 01:48:45.316 A:middle
and experience music is
undergoing a profound change

01:48:45.416 --> 01:48:45.866 A:middle
these days.

01:48:45.866 --> 01:48:48.006 A:middle
To have access to nearly
all the music in the world

01:48:48.006 --> 01:48:50.976 A:middle
at our fingertips and in
our pockets is remarkable.

01:48:51.046 --> 01:48:53.786 A:middle
And yet there needs
to be a place

01:48:53.786 --> 01:48:55.966 A:middle
where music can be treated
less like digital bits

01:48:55.966 --> 01:48:57.976 A:middle
and more like the art it is,

01:48:58.046 --> 01:49:00.826 A:middle
with a sense of respect
and discovery.

with a sense of respect
and discovery.

01:49:01.816 --> 01:49:03.536 A:middle
And if that place could
actually accommodate

01:49:03.536 --> 01:49:05.596 A:middle
and support the artists
who make the music,

01:49:05.596 --> 01:49:06.936 A:middle
not just the top-tier artists,

01:49:07.116 --> 01:49:10.536 A:middle
but the kids in their
bedrooms too, provide them all

01:49:10.536 --> 01:49:12.846 A:middle
with a home and a way to
engage with their audiences,

01:49:13.616 --> 01:49:14.926 A:middle
that would be pretty great.

01:49:16.066 --> 01:49:17.826 A:middle
And that's what we set out
to do with Apple Music.

01:49:18.516 --> 01:49:23.776 A:middle
[Music]

01:49:24.276 --> 01:49:27.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; On Apple Music, all the
ways you love music can now

01:49:27.306 --> 01:49:29.226 A:middle
live together.

01:49:29.226 --> 01:49:31.966 A:middle
Stream from the millions
of songs on iTunes any time

01:49:31.966 --> 01:49:34.786 A:middle
and on demand, along with
hand-picked playlists,

01:49:34.976 --> 01:49:37.316 A:middle
recommendations,
and all that's great

01:49:37.316 --> 01:49:39.226 A:middle
and breaking in music right now.

01:49:40.096 --> 01:49:44.696 A:middle
And broadcasting every day is
Apple's first 24/7 worldwide

01:49:44.696 --> 01:49:48.706 A:middle
radio station, live
in over 100 countries,

01:49:48.776 --> 01:49:51.326 A:middle
Beats 1 is anchored
by Zane Lowe in LA.

01:49:51.556 --> 01:49:53.536 A:middle
Ero Dodden in New York.

01:49:53.826 --> 01:49:56.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; New York City

01:49:56.236 --> 01:49:58.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And me, Julie out of London.

01:50:02.236 --> 01:50:06.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And at the heart of Apple
Music, there's Connect,

01:50:06.306 --> 01:50:08.926 A:middle
where artists can share
with fans like never before.

01:50:09.606 --> 01:50:12.686 A:middle
Songs, remixes, demos,
mix tapes, photos,

01:50:12.686 --> 01:50:15.886 A:middle
videos, lyrics, soundbites.

01:50:15.886 --> 01:50:18.976 A:middle
Really, any way an artist
chooses to express themselves.

01:50:21.166 --> 01:50:21.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TRENT REZNOR: For fans,

01:50:22.756 --> 01:50:24.596 A:middle
we tried to create a
complete experience,

01:50:24.596 --> 01:50:27.326 A:middle
by combining the catalog
of the world's music

01:50:27.326 --> 01:50:29.306 A:middle
with the music that's
not in that catalog yet,

01:50:29.306 --> 01:50:30.916 A:middle
direct from the artist to you

01:50:31.506 --> 01:50:32.976 A:middle
in a shared experience
with Beats 1.

01:50:33.066 --> 01:50:36.786 A:middle
For the artists, we've built
an ecosystem we hope can start

01:50:36.786 --> 01:50:40.586 A:middle
to provide the tools to grow,
nurture, and sustain careers.

01:50:40.586 --> 01:50:44.536 A:middle
One place, one complete
thought around music.

01:50:45.516 --> 01:50:49.516 A:middle

One app, one single

01:51:13.606 --> 01:51:15.316 A:middle
Apple Music is three things.

01:51:16.206 --> 01:51:21.066 A:middle
It's a revolutionary
music service.

01:51:21.226 --> 01:51:25.836 A:middle
Oh. A revolutionary
music service curated

01:51:25.836 --> 01:51:29.946 A:middle
by the leading music experts
who we helped hand-pick.

01:51:30.486 --> 01:51:32.366 A:middle
These people are
going to help you

01:51:32.366 --> 01:51:34.556 A:middle
with the most difficult
question in music.

01:51:34.696 --> 01:51:38.826 A:middle
When you are listening to a
playlist, what song comes next?

01:51:38.916 --> 01:51:41.526 A:middle
The only song that's
as important

01:51:41.526 --> 01:51:43.266 A:middle
as the one you are
listening to at

01:51:43.266 --> 01:51:46.166 A:middle
that moment is the
one that follows it.

01:51:46.286 --> 01:51:47.226 A:middle
Now, picture this.

01:51:47.746 --> 01:51:51.286 A:middle
You are in a special moment.

01:51:53.136 --> 01:51:56.586 A:middle
You're exercising or some
other special moment.

01:51:57.576 --> 01:51:57.936 A:middle
[Laughter] Right, Dre?

01:51:58.766 --> 01:52:00.036 A:middle
He exercises a lot.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:51:58.766 --> 01:52:00.036 A:middle
He exercises a lot.

01:52:01.926 --> 01:52:03.516 A:middle
And your heart's pumping.

01:52:04.526 --> 01:52:06.696 A:middle
And you are about
to turn up the reps.

01:52:06.696 --> 01:52:09.956 A:middle
And the next song
comes on, ehhh!

01:52:10.536 --> 01:52:11.796 A:middle
Buzz kill.

01:52:11.796 --> 01:52:14.586 A:middle
You may ask why that happened.

01:52:14.716 --> 01:52:17.276 A:middle
It happened because it
was probably programmed

01:52:17.566 --> 01:52:19.586 A:middle
by an algorithm alone.

01:52:19.916 --> 01:52:23.496 A:middle
Algorithms alone can't
do that emotional task.

01:52:24.006 --> 01:52:26.996 A:middle
You need a human touch, and
that's why at Apple Music,

01:52:26.996 --> 01:52:29.606 A:middle
we want to give you the right
song, the right playlist,

01:52:29.786 --> 01:52:32.586 A:middle
at the right moment,
all on demand.

01:52:33.066 --> 01:52:40.326 A:middle
Now, the first-ever live
24-hour worldwide radio station,

01:52:40.656 --> 01:52:43.626 A:middle
so Trent Reznor calls
me up and says I got it.

01:52:44.186 --> 01:52:45.426 A:middle
This is what we're going to do.

01:52:46.156 --> 01:52:51.436 A:middle
Let's build the first-ever
worldwide live radio station

01:52:51.436 --> 01:52:55.926 A:middle
broadcast from three cities
that plays music not based

01:52:55.926 --> 01:53:02.086 A:middle
on research, not based on
genre, not based on drum beats,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:52:55.926 --> 01:53:02.086 A:middle
on research, not based on
genre, not based on drum beats,

01:53:03.046 --> 01:53:07.776 A:middle
only music that is
great and feels great.

01:53:09.076 --> 01:53:13.016 A:middle
A station that has only
one master, music itself.

01:53:14.396 --> 01:53:18.426 A:middle
So I said why do artists
always have the greatest ideas

01:53:18.426 --> 01:53:22.536 A:middle
that are practically
impossible to execute?

01:53:22.536 --> 01:53:24.726 A:middle
So I said, well, wait a second.

01:53:25.366 --> 01:53:27.146 A:middle
That's why we are at Apple.

01:53:27.146 --> 01:53:30.816 A:middle
We are at Apple to help
artists' dreams be realized.

01:53:30.816 --> 01:53:37.186 A:middle
So we built the station, and
it's a music lover's dream.

01:53:37.586 --> 01:53:41.526 A:middle
If you love great music without
any restrictions, you are going

01:53:41.526 --> 01:53:44.346 A:middle
to love Apple Music's Beats 1.

01:53:45.586 --> 01:53:49.966 A:middle
Finally, Connect, a fantastic
way for established and new

01:53:49.966 --> 01:53:53.296 A:middle
and even unsigned artists
to connect directly

01:53:53.296 --> 01:53:54.926 A:middle
with music lovers anywhere.

01:53:56.246 --> 01:53:58.726 A:middle
This is going to be very
powerful for musicians.

01:53:59.456 --> 01:54:02.076 A:middle
Can you imagine being
an up-and-coming artist

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:53:59.456 --> 01:54:02.076 A:middle
Can you imagine being
an up-and-coming artist

01:54:02.076 --> 01:54:04.426 A:middle
and being able to
share your music

01:54:05.406 --> 01:54:07.826 A:middle
on the biggest music
platform on the world

01:54:07.886 --> 01:54:11.156 A:middle
that people already
have, Apple Music?

01:54:12.446 --> 01:54:14.546 A:middle
Remember, this is an ecosystem.

01:54:15.316 --> 01:54:17.536 A:middle
It's built to fit together.

01:54:17.566 --> 01:54:19.566 A:middle
It feeds off each other.

01:54:19.846 --> 01:54:21.416 A:middle
When you upload your music

01:54:21.416 --> 01:54:25.956 A:middle
to Apple Music, anything
can happen.

01:54:26.176 --> 01:54:29.586 A:middle
So now let me leave
the real heavy lifting

01:54:29.586 --> 01:54:31.806 A:middle
to my great friend, Eddy Cue,

01:54:31.956 --> 01:54:33.866 A:middle
and tell you how this
all works together.

01:54:34.516 --> 01:54:41.656 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:54:42.156 --> 01:54:42.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; EDDY CUE: Thank you, Jimmy.

01:54:43.806 --> 01:54:45.516 A:middle
It's great to be here
this morning with you.

01:54:46.226 --> 01:54:49.126 A:middle
So Apple Music, it's a
revolutionary music service,

01:54:49.556 --> 01:54:51.426 A:middle
and it starts with My Music.

01:54:52.056 --> 01:54:54.386 A:middle
We've added some great new
features from iTunes like the

01:54:54.386 --> 01:54:58.966 A:middle
Up Next queue, and also
your recently added albums

01:54:58.966 --> 01:55:00.546 A:middle
and songs right across the top.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:54:58.966 --> 01:55:00.546 A:middle
and songs right across the top.

01:55:00.546 --> 01:55:02.726 A:middle
And all of the music
you've purchased,

01:55:02.916 --> 01:55:05.186 A:middle
along with the playlists
you've created on your Mac

01:55:05.546 --> 01:55:07.336 A:middle
or your iPhone, are right here.

01:55:08.456 --> 01:55:11.046 A:middle
Now, of course, you can
search your music library,

01:55:11.166 --> 01:55:14.556 A:middle
but now you can search and
stream the millions and millions

01:55:14.556 --> 01:55:17.226 A:middle
of songs that we have on iTunes.

01:55:18.316 --> 01:55:22.256 A:middle
Now, in addition to My Music,
when you can stream and listen

01:55:22.256 --> 01:55:25.246 A:middle
to any song you want, you
need a great place to start,

01:55:25.966 --> 01:55:28.436 A:middle
and that's why we've
created For You.

01:55:29.236 --> 01:55:31.536 A:middle
For You recommends
playlists and albums

01:55:31.856 --> 01:55:33.836 A:middle
that we think you
are going to love.

01:55:34.056 --> 01:55:36.066 A:middle
They are personalized
to your taste based

01:55:36.066 --> 01:55:38.776 A:middle
on the music you listen
to, the artists you love.

01:55:38.946 --> 01:55:42.146 A:middle
And it isn't just algorithms.

01:55:43.356 --> 01:55:46.906 A:middle
It's recommendations made by
real people who love music,

01:55:47.166 --> 01:55:48.786 A:middle
and they are our
team of experts.

01:55:49.976 --> 01:55:51.196 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at New.

01:55:51.596 --> 01:55:54.146 A:middle
Here you will discover new
artists and albums every week,

01:55:55.056 --> 01:55:58.536 A:middle
along with the top charts, and
every one of our playlists,

01:55:58.636 --> 01:56:02.996 A:middle
all human-curated, available
by genre or by activity.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:55:58.636 --> 01:56:02.996 A:middle
all human-curated, available
by genre or by activity.

01:56:04.576 --> 01:56:07.016 A:middle
So when you think
of Apple Music,

01:56:07.306 --> 01:56:10.716 A:middle
it's My Music, For You and New.

01:56:11.716 --> 01:56:13.226 A:middle
It makes it fun and easy

01:56:13.506 --> 01:56:16.316 A:middle
to experience the catalog
of the world's music.

01:56:17.206 --> 01:56:19.516 A:middle
And that is the revolutionary
music service.

01:56:20.196 --> 01:56:21.566 A:middle
Now let's talk about Radio.

01:56:22.386 --> 01:56:25.726 A:middle
The truth is Internet
radio isn't really radio.

01:56:26.096 --> 01:56:27.726 A:middle
It's just a playlist of songs.

01:56:27.726 --> 01:56:30.226 A:middle
And so we wanted to do
something really big.

01:56:31.066 --> 01:56:34.676 A:middle
We wanted to create a worldwide
live radio station broadcasting

01:56:35.016 --> 01:56:38.456 A:middle
around the globe, and we've
done that with Beats 1.

01:56:39.206 --> 01:56:42.216 A:middle
It's the world's best radio
station now meets the world's

01:56:42.216 --> 01:56:46.186 A:middle
best voice, and that's
why we've hired Zane Lowe.

01:56:46.446 --> 01:56:50.646 A:middle
Zane is a masterful interviewer
and an influential music figure

01:56:50.646 --> 01:56:54.716 A:middle
in his own right, and to tell
you more about it, here is Zane.

01:56:55.216 --> 01:56:59.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; ZANE LOWE: I am a music fan.

01:56:59.666 --> 01:57:01.286 A:middle
I play records.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:56:59.666 --> 01:57:01.286 A:middle
I play records.

01:57:01.496 --> 01:57:04.016 A:middle
What I love is watching
a group of people react

01:57:04.016 --> 01:57:06.206 A:middle
to a great record
for the first time.

01:57:06.976 --> 01:57:09.926 A:middle
When I play that record on the
radio, the audience tell me,

01:57:09.926 --> 01:57:11.296 A:middle
the time lines light up,

01:57:11.416 --> 01:57:13.796 A:middle
my friends tell me,
my phone lights up.

01:57:14.066 --> 01:57:16.226 A:middle
They love it or they hate it.

01:57:16.536 --> 01:57:17.836 A:middle
But it creates a debate.

01:57:18.406 --> 01:57:20.676 A:middle
That's what good music
on the radio does.

01:57:21.556 --> 01:57:24.256 A:middle
When Apple first asked me to be
involved in this, they told us

01:57:24.256 --> 01:57:28.236 A:middle
to put the great music in front
of the average, the unexpected,

01:57:28.236 --> 01:57:31.966 A:middle
the undiscovered, the
anticipated, the underrated.

01:57:32.246 --> 01:57:34.386 A:middle
Their words: Move the needle.

01:57:34.386 --> 01:57:36.236 A:middle
And that's what we are doing.

01:57:36.696 --> 01:57:39.446 A:middle
We have real music fans
running this place.

01:57:39.596 --> 01:57:43.096 A:middle
We have great music DJs and
incredible artists who are

01:57:43.096 --> 01:57:46.306 A:middle
in the studio right now
building real radio shows

01:57:46.306 --> 01:57:47.706 A:middle
that are going to
blow your mind.

01:57:48.026 --> 01:57:51.816 A:middle
And the only place that can
pull off an imaginative idea

01:57:51.816 --> 01:57:53.826 A:middle
as big as this -- Apple.

01:57:53.936 --> 01:57:55.716 A:middle
We are called Beats 1.

01:57:55.986 --> 01:58:01.146 A:middle
We are always on, playing
the music that we love.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:57:55.986 --> 01:58:01.146 A:middle
We are always on, playing
the music that we love.

01:58:01.646 --> 01:58:05.276 A:middle
[Applause]

01:58:05.776 --> 01:58:07.386 A:middle
&gt;&gt; EDDY CUE: So Beats 1.

01:58:07.596 --> 01:58:11.426 A:middle
It is worldwide, it is live,
it is broadcasting 24 by 7,

01:58:11.426 --> 01:58:13.486 A:middle
and it is coming
from New York, LA,

01:58:13.486 --> 01:58:16.616 A:middle
and London, and that is Radio.

01:58:17.426 --> 01:58:20.726 A:middle
Next, we wanted to find a
way to bring fans closer

01:58:20.726 --> 01:58:23.446 A:middle
to the artists they love,
and we call it Connect.

01:58:23.496 --> 01:58:29.016 A:middle
It's a place where artists are
free to upload their music,

01:58:29.016 --> 01:58:33.416 A:middle
their videos, their photos,
all directly to a fan.

01:58:34.486 --> 01:58:37.716 A:middle
Let's take Pharrell, a favorite
musician and songwriter of mine.

01:58:38.626 --> 01:58:42.196 A:middle
He is prolific, and
he does a lot.

01:58:42.196 --> 01:58:44.136 A:middle
Let me show you how
it works with Connect.

01:58:44.446 --> 01:58:45.846 A:middle
He takes a lot of photos.

01:58:46.526 --> 01:58:47.926 A:middle
He writes a lot of lyrics.

01:58:48.686 --> 01:58:51.356 A:middle
He's experimenting and
mixing songs all the time.

01:58:51.846 --> 01:58:54.776 A:middle
Or he just has something
new and interesting to say.

01:58:55.496 --> 01:58:57.986 A:middle
All of this lives
right in Connect.

01:58:58.956 --> 01:59:03.236 A:middle
Artists can post and
publish and upload anything,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:58:58.956 --> 01:59:03.236 A:middle
Artists can post and
publish and upload anything,

01:59:03.276 --> 01:59:06.736 A:middle
including directly to Facebook,
Twitter, and their own website,

01:59:06.736 --> 01:59:10.446 A:middle
and fans can like and
comment on those posts.

01:59:11.756 --> 01:59:14.796 A:middle
And it's not just for one
artist, but it's for all

01:59:14.796 --> 01:59:16.276 A:middle
of the artists that you love.

01:59:16.796 --> 01:59:18.756 A:middle
And to give you a
little sense of what it's

01:59:18.756 --> 01:59:21.476 A:middle
like to be an artist on Connect,

01:59:21.866 --> 01:59:24.776 A:middle
I'd like to invite
up a friend, Drake.

01:59:25.516 --> 01:59:39.806 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

01:59:40.306 --> 01:59:40.636 A:middle
&gt;&gt; DRAKE: Thank you.

01:59:41.906 --> 01:59:47.546 A:middle
I want to say, honestly, what an
honor it is to be in this room

01:59:48.306 --> 01:59:50.736 A:middle
with so many individuals
that have changed the way

01:59:50.736 --> 01:59:52.426 A:middle
in which the world
relates to technology,

01:59:52.426 --> 01:59:53.926 A:middle
so give yourselves a
round of applause, please.

01:59:54.516 --> 01:59:58.546 A:middle
[Applause]

01:59:59.046 --> 02:00:04.466 A:middle
For example, I bought this
vintage Apple employee's jacket

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:59:59.046 --> 02:00:04.466 A:middle
For example, I bought this
vintage Apple employee's jacket

02:00:04.466 --> 02:00:08.176 A:middle
using a tool known in the
rap world as the Internet.

02:00:08.176 --> 02:00:09.246 A:middle
It's going to be huge this year.

02:00:10.786 --> 02:00:11.506 A:middle
It's out of this world.

02:00:11.506 --> 02:00:13.236 A:middle
He is excited, he knows about
it, that guy right there.

02:00:14.266 --> 02:00:17.266 A:middle
[Laughter] Honestly, in all
seriousness, I came here today

02:00:17.266 --> 02:00:21.366 A:middle
to share my story, about the
way technology changed what I do

02:00:21.366 --> 02:00:21.906 A:middle
for a living.

02:00:21.906 --> 02:00:24.736 A:middle
I am from Toronto, Canada.

02:00:25.516 --> 02:00:29.516 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

02:00:30.016 --> 02:00:32.000 A:middle
[Laughter]

02:00:32.356 --> 02:00:35.746 A:middle
You know, as a kid growing up,
I always wondered if my city

02:00:35.746 --> 02:00:39.666 A:middle
or even my country would
have somebody break

02:00:39.666 --> 02:00:42.496 A:middle
into the global music
scene as a true superstar.

02:00:42.586 --> 02:00:46.336 A:middle
You know, the dream seemed
unattainable at the time.

02:00:46.996 --> 02:00:49.796 A:middle
Even myself, I tried to
do it the traditional way,

02:00:49.796 --> 02:00:54.706 A:middle
the towering New York label
buildings, the lobby littered

02:00:54.706 --> 02:00:57.136 A:middle
with other people's
accomplishments.

02:00:58.106 --> 02:01:00.946 A:middle
It's improbable to think that
every talented artist is going

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

02:00:58.106 --> 02:01:00.946 A:middle
It's improbable to think that
every talented artist is going

02:01:00.946 --> 02:01:03.166 A:middle
to get a shot to have
their vision validated.

02:01:03.686 --> 02:01:07.706 A:middle
And then that's when
the game changed.

02:01:08.216 --> 02:01:10.406 A:middle
And we had to change it.

02:01:10.816 --> 02:01:14.886 A:middle
Myself and my team
brought our vision

02:01:15.766 --> 02:01:17.596 A:middle
and our music directly
to the people.

02:01:18.146 --> 02:01:25.716 A:middle
And that was kind of the first
time that we really got noticed.

02:01:26.046 --> 02:01:31.096 A:middle
The dream of being a new artist
like myself five years ago

02:01:31.776 --> 02:01:34.676 A:middle
and connecting directly with
an audience has never been more

02:01:34.676 --> 02:01:36.856 A:middle
close and reachable
than right now.

02:01:37.656 --> 02:01:43.056 A:middle
See, now we encourage you to
spend the time on your body

02:01:43.056 --> 02:01:47.616 A:middle
of work, spend the time on your
craft, assemble the right body

02:01:47.616 --> 02:01:49.986 A:middle
of work, and instead of
having to post your stuff

02:01:49.986 --> 02:01:53.276 A:middle
on all these different and
sometimes confusing places,

02:01:54.216 --> 02:01:56.626 A:middle
it all lives in one very simple,

02:01:56.626 --> 02:02:00.696 A:middle
very easy place,
and that is Connect.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

02:01:56.626 --> 02:02:00.696 A:middle
very easy place,
and that is Connect.

02:02:00.806 --> 02:02:03.396 A:middle
It's right from where
you are in your city

02:02:03.396 --> 02:02:04.506 A:middle
in front of your computer.

02:02:05.526 --> 02:02:08.376 A:middle
And this approach is
how we broke in 2008,

02:02:08.376 --> 02:02:11.536 A:middle
and it has been perfected
and simplified, of course,

02:02:11.536 --> 02:02:14.216 A:middle
by the great people at Apple.

02:02:14.446 --> 02:02:20.526 A:middle
So you know, as I'm working
tirelessly on this next album,

02:02:20.626 --> 02:02:22.156 A:middle
this comes at the
perfect time for me.

02:02:22.676 --> 02:02:28.186 A:middle
Given the great success of my
last mix tape that went directly

02:02:28.516 --> 02:02:30.596 A:middle
to iTunes, this really --

02:02:30.596 --> 02:02:37.266 A:middle
I can't wait to incorporate
Apple Music

02:02:37.266 --> 02:02:39.156 A:middle
and especially Connect
into what I am doing next.

02:02:39.156 --> 02:02:40.616 A:middle
I am really excited about
what I am working on.

02:02:40.906 --> 02:02:44.076 A:middle
And as an artist, I can say for
all those kids sitting at home,

02:02:44.796 --> 02:02:49.326 A:middle
it's truly amazing to be part
of something that I believe in,

02:02:49.326 --> 02:02:54.186 A:middle
and this is something
that simplifies everything

02:02:54.796 --> 02:02:56.726 A:middle
for the modern musician
like myself

02:02:57.406 --> 02:02:59.776 A:middle
and the modern music
consumer like you.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

02:03:00.416 --> 02:03:02.166 A:middle
So I hope you enjoy Apple Music.

02:03:02.166 --> 02:03:03.156 A:middle
I hope you enjoy Connect.

02:03:03.156 --> 02:03:04.936 A:middle
My name is Drake, and
thank you for your time.

02:03:05.056 --> 02:03:05.726 A:middle
Appreciate it.

02:03:06.516 --> 02:03:13.106 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

02:03:13.606 --> 02:03:14.386 A:middle
&gt;&gt; EDDY CUE: Thank you, Drake.

02:03:16.356 --> 02:03:17.566 A:middle
And that is Connect.

02:03:18.026 --> 02:03:20.976 A:middle
Now, I'd love to give you
a demo of Apple Music,

02:03:21.656 --> 02:03:23.856 A:middle
but before I start, I do want

02:03:23.856 --> 02:03:26.976 A:middle
to wish Phil Schiller
a happy birthday.

02:03:27.516 --> 02:03:39.066 A:middle
[Cheers and applause]

02:03:39.566 --> 02:03:43.526 A:middle
So let's go ahead and
launch our new Music app.

02:03:43.526 --> 02:03:45.736 A:middle
You will notice right away
it's got a brand-new UI,

02:03:45.736 --> 02:03:46.786 A:middle
much simpler to use.

02:03:47.196 --> 02:03:49.826 A:middle
Your recently added albums and
songs right across the top.

02:03:49.826 --> 02:03:51.966 A:middle
Let's play this new
song from Spoon I added.

02:03:53.516 --> 02:03:56.676 A:middle
[Music]

02:03:57.176 --> 02:03:58.226 A:middle
One of the things
you will notice,

02:03:58.226 --> 02:04:00.056 A:middle
we have a new mini
player across the bottom

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

02:03:58.226 --> 02:04:00.056 A:middle
we have a new mini
player across the bottom

02:04:00.056 --> 02:04:01.656 A:middle
that always shows
you what's playing.

02:04:02.056 --> 02:04:04.826 A:middle
If I tap on it, I
get full screen,

02:04:04.986 --> 02:04:06.656 A:middle
and I can see the
beautiful artwork,

02:04:07.066 --> 02:04:08.286 A:middle
all the playback controls.

02:04:08.476 --> 02:04:13.596 A:middle
I can just swipe down,
and it disappears.

02:04:16.026 --> 02:04:18.316 A:middle
Now, I like looking
at my music by artist.

02:04:18.606 --> 02:04:19.706 A:middle
It's really easy to do that too.

02:04:19.706 --> 02:04:22.696 A:middle
I will just tap on
Albums, switch to Artists,

02:04:23.726 --> 02:04:25.306 A:middle
and let's take a look
at Aretha Franklin.

02:04:25.306 --> 02:04:28.336 A:middle
The first thing you will notice
is we add beautiful artwork

02:04:28.336 --> 02:04:29.476 A:middle
to all the artist pages.

02:04:30.346 --> 02:04:32.606 A:middle
Notice as I swipe
up, it goes away,

02:04:32.606 --> 02:04:34.206 A:middle
and you see Aretha at the top.

02:04:34.206 --> 02:04:37.396 A:middle
No demo goes complete
without playing this song.

02:04:39.516 --> 02:04:49.786 A:middle
[Music]

02:04:50.286 --> 02:04:53.566 A:middle
Now, you not only get all of
your Aretha Franklin songs

02:04:53.626 --> 02:04:56.126 A:middle
in your music library, but
you can also tap on All,

02:04:56.546 --> 02:04:59.316 A:middle
and now you can see all of
the songs on Apple Music,

02:04:59.346 --> 02:05:02.226 A:middle
including the latest
release, what the top song is,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

02:04:59.346 --> 02:05:02.226 A:middle
including the latest
release, what the top song is,

02:05:02.786 --> 02:05:04.296 A:middle
what the top album is.

02:05:05.736 --> 02:05:07.936 A:middle
Now, it is hard to stop this
song, but I want to keep going.

02:05:08.156 --> 02:05:11.256 A:middle
Now let's go back to my library,

02:05:11.256 --> 02:05:13.086 A:middle
and let's take a
look at my playlists.

02:05:13.876 --> 02:05:15.896 A:middle
Now, despite the game last
night, I am getting ready

02:05:15.896 --> 02:05:17.836 A:middle
for tomorrow night, and I
have already started creating

02:05:17.836 --> 02:05:18.586 A:middle
my playlist.

02:05:19.166 --> 02:05:21.016 A:middle
One of the first things you will
notice is you can add your own

02:05:21.016 --> 02:05:22.386 A:middle
artwork to your playlist.

02:05:22.386 --> 02:05:24.496 A:middle
I am going to be
doing this tonight,

02:05:24.496 --> 02:05:27.786 A:middle
getting the Warriors
ready, but let's go back.

02:05:27.786 --> 02:05:32.966 A:middle
It is karaoke night, and
these are some of the songs

02:05:32.966 --> 02:05:35.556 A:middle
that our team has to
look forward to tonight.

02:05:35.556 --> 02:05:36.646 A:middle
Let's go ahead and play that.

02:05:37.081 --> 02:05:39.081 A:middle
[Music]

02:05:39.146 --> 02:05:39.846 A:middle
Just imagine.

02:05:40.516 --> 02:05:44.516 A:middle
[Music]

02:05:45.016 --> 02:05:48.036 A:middle
Now, if I tap on
the mini player,

02:05:48.036 --> 02:05:50.116 A:middle
I can see the full screen.

02:05:50.116 --> 02:05:52.886 A:middle
If I tap on the right-hand side
next to the playback controls,

02:05:53.036 --> 02:05:55.306 A:middle
I can see the complete
playlist, and it's very easy

02:05:55.306 --> 02:05:56.376 A:middle
for me to reorganize it.

02:05:56.376 --> 02:05:57.906 A:middle
Let's say I want to
move Jealous back up,

02:05:58.896 --> 02:06:00.576 A:middle
and now that will be the
next song that plays.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

02:05:58.896 --> 02:06:00.576 A:middle
and now that will be the
next song that plays.

02:06:00.776 --> 02:06:01.646 A:middle
It's that simple.

02:06:02.516 --> 02:06:08.596 A:middle
[Applause]

02:06:09.096 --> 02:06:10.046 A:middle
Now, that's great.

02:06:10.046 --> 02:06:12.986 A:middle
The first time we go to For You,
we want to find out a little bit

02:06:12.986 --> 02:06:14.896 A:middle
about your musical
tastes, so we are going

02:06:14.896 --> 02:06:16.766 A:middle
to ask you what genres you like.

02:06:16.766 --> 02:06:23.576 A:middle
I am a big fan of rock, pop,
hip-hop, and alternative.

02:06:24.646 --> 02:06:28.266 A:middle
And now it will ask me for
some artists that I like.

02:06:29.156 --> 02:06:31.566 A:middle
Well, I love Bruce Springsteen,
so I am going to tap twice.

02:06:31.696 --> 02:06:35.686 A:middle
I like Lorde, like
Alabama Shakes.

02:06:36.416 --> 02:06:37.686 A:middle
Now we are going to take all

02:06:37.686 --> 02:06:40.286 A:middle
of this information you've
provided, along with all

02:06:40.286 --> 02:06:43.736 A:middle
of your playlists and the songs
that you've purchased on iTunes,

02:06:43.736 --> 02:06:46.226 A:middle
and we are going to make
recommendations just for you.

02:06:46.626 --> 02:06:48.756 A:middle
So here is one inspired
by Bruce Springsteen.

02:06:49.926 --> 02:06:51.936 A:middle
Here's one called
Bring the Big Rock.

02:06:51.936 --> 02:06:52.976 A:middle
Let's play that.

02:06:53.516 --> 02:06:56.876 A:middle
[Music]

02:06:57.376 --> 02:06:58.776 A:middle
That's a great Foo
Fighters song.

02:06:59.376 --> 02:07:01.246 A:middle
I can just tap and see
the rest of the songs.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

02:06:59.376 --> 02:07:01.246 A:middle
I can just tap and see
the rest of the songs.

02:07:03.206 --> 02:07:04.296 A:middle
Definitely going to
like this playlist.

02:07:07.226 --> 02:07:09.216 A:middle
Now, here's another
one from Pharrell.

02:07:09.216 --> 02:07:11.866 A:middle
I also get new albums
that are available to me,

02:07:11.866 --> 02:07:14.196 A:middle
and even some classic albums
that I should be listening to.

02:07:14.196 --> 02:07:17.636 A:middle
And so here are some
brand-new albums

02:07:17.636 --> 02:07:19.046 A:middle
from the artists
that I really love.

02:07:19.796 --> 02:07:25.556 A:middle
Now, here is an interesting
one, a Cuban playlist.

02:07:25.556 --> 02:07:27.026 A:middle
You might be wondering
how did that get in there?

02:07:27.026 --> 02:07:31.546 A:middle
Well, I like a lot of Latin
music, so Apple Music knows that

02:07:31.546 --> 02:07:33.006 A:middle
and is recommending
this playlist to me.

02:07:33.006 --> 02:07:34.506 A:middle
Let's take a look at it.

02:07:36.516 --> 02:07:42.886 A:middle
[Music]

02:07:43.386 --> 02:07:44.976 A:middle
Definitely gets my
Cuban blood going.

02:07:45.516 --> 02:07:50.046 A:middle
[Music]

02:07:50.546 --> 02:07:53.646 A:middle
Now, this is a playlist I
definitely want to keep,

02:07:53.716 --> 02:07:56.546 A:middle
so I am going to tap on the
plus sign, and I've added

02:07:56.546 --> 02:07:57.906 A:middle
that now to my playlist.

02:07:58.216 --> 02:08:03.456 A:middle
Now, let's take a
look at what's new.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

02:07:58.216 --> 02:08:03.456 A:middle
Now, let's take a
look at what's new.

02:08:04.216 --> 02:08:06.426 A:middle
You can see new albums
across the top.

02:08:07.456 --> 02:08:09.796 A:middle
More here, and even the
hot singles that are out.

02:08:09.796 --> 02:08:12.006 A:middle
Let's play this one from
Florence and the Machine.

02:08:13.516 --> 02:08:24.016 A:middle
[Music]

02:08:24.516 --> 02:08:29.846 A:middle
I can keep scrolling and
see some recent releases.

02:08:30.356 --> 02:08:33.586 A:middle
But of course, everyone loves
the charts, so let's go ahead

02:08:33.586 --> 02:08:36.486 A:middle
and take a look at the
charts, see the top songs.

02:08:37.976 --> 02:08:38.906 A:middle
The top albums.

02:08:38.906 --> 02:08:41.166 A:middle
And even the top music videos.

02:08:41.166 --> 02:08:44.616 A:middle
We have tens of thousands of
music videos in HD, all ad-free.

02:08:45.256 --> 02:08:47.036 A:middle
Let's take a look at this
one from Mark Ronson.

02:08:50.516 --> 02:09:19.716 A:middle
[Music]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

[Music]

02:09:20.216 --> 02:09:21.946 A:middle
I've got to work on some of
those moves for next year.

02:09:24.336 --> 02:09:25.866 A:middle
[Laughter] Now, sometimes
you just want to sit back

02:09:25.866 --> 02:09:29.316 A:middle
and let someone else be your
DJ, so let's go to Radio.

02:09:29.356 --> 02:09:30.966 A:middle
And to give you a little taste

02:09:30.966 --> 02:09:32.656 A:middle
of what Beats 1 is
going to sound like ...

02:09:37.446 --> 02:09:37.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Beats 1.

02:09:37.776 --> 02:09:39.376 A:middle
Welcome our special guest,

02:09:39.476 --> 02:09:40.936 A:middle
Florence from Florence
and the Machine.

02:09:41.046 --> 02:09:44.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; On paper, it sounds like
super, not how you think a rock

02:09:44.656 --> 02:09:45.976 A:middle
and roll album would be made.

02:09:46.406 --> 02:09:47.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Was that you in
your sweatpants?

02:09:47.936 --> 02:09:50.756 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That was me in an anorak
cycling to the studio.

02:09:52.076 --> 02:09:54.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; We are looking for the
most exciting music and people

02:09:54.406 --> 02:09:56.666 A:middle
that love it in all
corners of the globe,

02:09:56.666 --> 02:09:58.636 A:middle
broadcasting to 100 countries.

02:09:58.636 --> 02:10:00.896 A:middle
That shared experience
just got so much bigger.

That shared experience
just got so much bigger.

02:10:03.176 --> 02:10:03.243 A:middle
&gt;&gt; LA.

02:10:03.356 --> 02:10:03.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; New York City.

02:10:05.766 --> 02:10:05.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; London.

02:10:06.046 --> 02:10:06.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; EDDY CUE: That's
really awesome.

02:10:07.636 --> 02:10:08.876 A:middle
Let's take a look at Connect

02:10:08.876 --> 02:10:11.306 A:middle
and see what my favorite
artists are up to.

02:10:12.256 --> 02:10:14.766 A:middle
Here's Pharrell and some
behind-the-scenes footage.

02:10:15.386 --> 02:10:16.356 A:middle
Here is Chris Cornell.

02:10:16.356 --> 02:10:18.236 A:middle
This is an interesting one.

02:10:18.236 --> 02:10:21.176 A:middle
He has posted lyrics of a new
song that's coming out before,

02:10:21.176 --> 02:10:23.106 A:middle
obviously, he's even
recorded it.

02:10:23.356 --> 02:10:25.096 A:middle
Here's Bastille.

02:10:25.166 --> 02:10:28.016 A:middle
They are working on
their next album.

02:10:28.016 --> 02:10:29.456 A:middle
Let's see what they have to say.

02:10:31.476 --> 02:10:33.626 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Mark is just through
here, and we are working

02:10:33.626 --> 02:10:36.466 A:middle
on a song called Blame, which
some of you might have heard

02:10:36.466 --> 02:10:38.826 A:middle
at festivals or gigs before,

02:10:39.186 --> 02:10:42.306 A:middle
but we're really excited to
have finally recorded it.

02:10:42.356 --> 02:10:43.996 A:middle
It's a song about gangsters.

02:10:43.996 --> 02:10:45.206 A:middle
And yeah, this is the riff,

02:10:45.206 --> 02:10:47.096 A:middle
which we already
have sounding great.

02:10:48.516 --> 02:10:54.496 A:middle
[Music]

02:10:54.996 --> 02:10:56.926 A:middle
&gt;&gt; EDDY CUE: It's great to be
able to get behind the scenes

02:10:56.926 --> 02:10:59.726 A:middle
and see what the process that
an artist uses to create a song.

02:10:59.726 --> 02:11:03.146 A:middle
As we keep going
down, here's a shot

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

As we keep going
down, here's a shot

02:11:03.146 --> 02:11:05.486 A:middle
from Alabama Shakes
a couple nights ago.

02:11:06.026 --> 02:11:09.026 A:middle
And here is a studio session,
actually, at Capital Studio A.

02:11:09.376 --> 02:11:11.216 A:middle
Those of you who know,
Capitol Studio is one

02:11:11.216 --> 02:11:13.346 A:middle
of the premier studios,
historical,

02:11:13.756 --> 02:11:15.976 A:middle
and Alabama Shakes was just
there a couple nights ago.

[Music]

02:11:40.656 --> 02:11:41.386 A:middle
&gt;&gt; EDDY CUE: Again, be able

02:11:41.386 --> 02:11:44.116 A:middle
to see things you've never
been able to hear or see.

02:11:45.216 --> 02:11:48.406 A:middle
Loren Kramar, you probably
have never heard of him.

02:11:48.406 --> 02:11:51.146 A:middle
He is an unsigned artist, I
just started following him.

02:11:51.776 --> 02:11:54.416 A:middle
He has posted a new song
right up on Connect,

02:11:54.416 --> 02:11:55.766 A:middle
and I would love to play it now.

02:11:56.126 --> 02:11:57.986 A:middle
First time anyone's heard it.

02:12:06.046 --> 02:12:07.086 A:middle
Just imagine you
are a new artist,

02:12:07.086 --> 02:12:09.216 A:middle
and look at all the
people who have been able

02:12:09.216 --> 02:12:10.976 A:middle
to hear this song right
now thanks to Connect.

02:12:11.516 --> 02:12:26.046 A:middle
[Music]

02:12:26.546 --> 02:12:27.486 A:middle
So Loren Kramar.

02:12:27.586 --> 02:12:28.556 A:middle
Remember that name.

02:12:28.896 --> 02:12:30.726 A:middle
We think he is going to
be really, really huge.

02:12:31.736 --> 02:12:34.456 A:middle
Now, of course, you can always
search for music across all

02:12:34.456 --> 02:12:35.866 A:middle
of our millions and
millions of songs.

02:12:35.866 --> 02:12:38.396 A:middle
I like to do a little
bit of stuff with Siri

02:12:38.396 --> 02:12:40.766 A:middle
because Siri has been learning
a lot more about music.

02:12:42.016 --> 02:12:43.826 A:middle
Play Born to Run.

02:12:59.396 --> 02:13:01.096 A:middle

It's one of my favorite
songs of all time.

02:13:01.096 --> 02:13:02.476 A:middle
Let's get a little
more specific.

02:13:02.476 --> 02:13:05.976 A:middle
Play the top ten
songs in Alternative.

02:13:09.516 --> 02:13:20.376 A:middle
[Music]

02:13:20.876 --> 02:13:23.916 A:middle
If I tap on the Up Next
queue, I can see all

02:13:23.916 --> 02:13:25.856 A:middle
of the top ten songs
and what's next.

02:13:30.216 --> 02:13:34.116 A:middle
Now, I feel like reminiscing
a little, and let's go back

02:13:34.116 --> 02:13:36.256 A:middle
to my high school
days when I graduated.

02:13:37.596 --> 02:13:40.976 A:middle
Play the top song from May 1982.

Now, that brings back some
memories, but we will leave

02:14:04.276 --> 02:14:05.176 A:middle
that for another time.

02:14:05.176 --> 02:14:10.026 A:middle
Have you ever gone to a movie
and you love the soundtrack

02:14:10.026 --> 02:14:12.476 A:middle
or the song that was on there,
but you don't know the name

02:14:13.006 --> 02:14:14.446 A:middle
or you have forgotten
about it later?

02:14:14.446 --> 02:14:17.736 A:middle
Well, it's really
easy with Siri.

02:14:17.736 --> 02:14:19.466 A:middle
Play the song from Selma.

02:14:25.516 --> 02:14:29.346 A:middle

02:14:29.846 --> 02:14:32.766 A:middle
Let's do that again.

02:14:32.766 --> 02:14:33.976 A:middle
Play the song from Selma.

02:14:54.686 --> 02:14:57.866 A:middle

an exciting way for fans

month with iOS 8.4 for your

as well as a new version

a new version of

Or you share an account even
though you are not supposed to.

02:16:09.926 --> 02:16:12.316 A:middle
And now all of you can't
play at the same time,

02:16:13.406 --> 02:16:14.336 A:middle
and your playlists

02:16:14.336 --> 02:16:16.296 A:middle

of our team that have worked

02:18:43.825 --> 02:18:47.106 A:middle
so hard on making
and creating all

02:18:47.106 --> 02:18:48.766 A:middle

and it's not only a hot
new artist, but he's going

02:19:25.136 --> 02:19:29.776 A:middle
to do a worldwide premiere of
his newest song this morning.
