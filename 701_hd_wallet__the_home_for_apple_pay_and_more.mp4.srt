00:00:06.726 --> 00:00:16.015 A:middle
&gt;&gt; DANVIN RUANGCHAN: All
right, good morning, everyone,

00:00:26.206 --> 00:00:31.476 A:middle
and welcome to session 701.

00:00:31.746 --> 00:00:34.646 A:middle
My name is Danvin, and I'm
really excited to be here today

00:00:34.646 --> 00:00:36.876 A:middle
to talk to you guys
about Wallet,

00:00:37.596 --> 00:00:40.136 A:middle
the app formerly
known as Passbook.

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:41.016 A:middle
All right.

00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:44.856 A:middle
With a new name, we
also have a new logo!

00:00:45.676 --> 00:00:48.996 A:middle
And you may have seen our
icon if you installed iOS 9,

00:00:49.226 --> 00:00:54.136 A:middle
this is now our new icon, but
beauty is more than skin deep.

00:00:54.606 --> 00:00:57.156 A:middle
We have been working on a
lot of features for Wallet

00:00:57.156 --> 00:00:58.306 A:middle
over the past few years.

00:00:58.586 --> 00:01:00.836 A:middle
We will talk about a
few of those today.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:58.586 --> 00:01:00.836 A:middle
We will talk about a
few of those today.

00:01:01.236 --> 00:01:03.506 A:middle
So let's take a look at
our agenda and take a look

00:01:03.506 --> 00:01:05.206 A:middle
at what we will be
talking about today.

00:01:05.786 --> 00:01:08.166 A:middle
First we're going to take a
glance at what we've been up to

00:01:08.906 --> 00:01:11.676 A:middle
and then a quick history lesson

00:01:11.836 --> 00:01:13.976 A:middle
and review all of
Wallet's features.

00:01:14.186 --> 00:01:16.086 A:middle
We will talk about
what is a Pass.

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.586 A:middle
We will talk about PassKit,
our framework inside iOS

00:01:19.586 --> 00:01:24.356 A:middle
and we're going to talk about
Apple Pay and then there's more!

00:01:24.606 --> 00:01:25.276 A:middle
So stick around.

00:01:25.276 --> 00:01:27.316 A:middle
We have a lot of content
to talk about today.

00:01:27.946 --> 00:01:28.996 A:middle
So what have we been up to?

00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:32.126 A:middle
Well, Apple Pay is
what we have been up to

00:01:32.386 --> 00:01:34.906 A:middle
and Apple Pay was
introduced last fall,

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.566 A:middle
and the responses
have been great!

00:01:38.236 --> 00:01:40.426 A:middle
Consumers have loved
its ease of use.

00:01:40.746 --> 00:01:43.726 A:middle
And merchants have loved
its higher conversion rates.

00:01:44.876 --> 00:01:48.276 A:middle
And now with Apple Pay we have
now enabled contactless payments

00:01:48.626 --> 00:01:50.526 A:middle
on our phones, our watches.

00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:52.006 A:middle
We even released an API

00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:56.946 A:middle
so you can take Apple Pay
inside your apps as well.

00:01:58.226 --> 00:02:00.646 A:middle
But to understand the
essence of Wallet,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:58.226 --> 00:02:00.646 A:middle
But to understand the
essence of Wallet,

00:02:00.756 --> 00:02:04.826 A:middle
to understand what we are about,
we need to take a look back.

00:02:05.396 --> 00:02:08.906 A:middle
Take a look back and
see how we got here.

00:02:09.936 --> 00:02:12.346 A:middle
Does this ring a bell?

00:02:12.346 --> 00:02:13.656 A:middle
Does this look familiar
to anyone.

00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:15.836 A:middle
Does anyone have a wallet
that looks like this?

00:02:17.296 --> 00:02:18.526 A:middle
I'm sure someone out there

00:02:18.526 --> 00:02:19.876 A:middle
who has a wallet
that looks like this.

00:02:19.876 --> 00:02:21.966 A:middle
This is a real problem.

00:02:22.406 --> 00:02:25.606 A:middle
We stick our gift cards in here,
our debit cards and credit cards

00:02:25.606 --> 00:02:28.626 A:middle
and our coupons and
then when we try

00:02:28.626 --> 00:02:31.316 A:middle
to find something,
we can't find it.

00:02:32.726 --> 00:02:36.196 A:middle
The overstuffed wallet
is a real problem.

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:39.206 A:middle
And we are trying to solve
that problem with Wallet.

00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:41.846 A:middle
We do so with passes.

00:02:41.846 --> 00:02:45.176 A:middle
We have beautiful
passes inside Wallet.

00:02:45.376 --> 00:02:50.716 A:middle
We have passes for coupons, for
event tickets for store cards,

00:02:51.186 --> 00:02:53.016 A:middle
and even for boarding
passes as well.

00:02:53.716 --> 00:02:56.106 A:middle
But all the things that
these passes have in common,

00:02:56.416 --> 00:03:00.646 A:middle
is that they all allow us to
take action in the real world.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:56.416 --> 00:03:00.646 A:middle
is that they all allow us to
take action in the real world.

00:03:01.216 --> 00:03:05.426 A:middle
And now, with Apple Pay,
we have your credit cards

00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:08.386 A:middle
and debit cards inside
Wallet as well.

00:03:08.386 --> 00:03:10.116 A:middle
But we went beyond that.

00:03:10.116 --> 00:03:12.196 A:middle
We want to solve the problem
where we can't find the thing

00:03:12.196 --> 00:03:13.806 A:middle
at the right place at the
right time so we built

00:03:13.806 --> 00:03:17.076 A:middle
in relevancy inside
our passes as well.

00:03:17.076 --> 00:03:17.946 A:middle
And they look like this.

00:03:17.946 --> 00:03:19.416 A:middle
If you come to the airport,

00:03:19.716 --> 00:03:21.786 A:middle
your boarding pass is right
there waiting for you.

00:03:22.316 --> 00:03:24.636 A:middle
All I do is swipe
on the lock screen

00:03:24.886 --> 00:03:27.636 A:middle
and my boarding pass
is ready to use.

00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:29.816 A:middle
It's so great!

00:03:29.816 --> 00:03:32.736 A:middle
It's that great surprise in the
light factor that this brings.

00:03:32.956 --> 00:03:37.246 A:middle
But let's take a
look at these passes.

00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:39.996 A:middle
In essence, these passes
contain information.

00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:43.766 A:middle
On the top left-hand corner
you will see there's a logo.

00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:47.876 A:middle
It clearly states the entity
that this pass belongs to.

00:03:48.016 --> 00:03:49.236 A:middle
In this particular
case we are looking

00:03:49.236 --> 00:03:50.526 A:middle
at a United boarding pass.

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:54.306 A:middle
So their logo is
predominantly up there

00:03:54.306 --> 00:03:55.566 A:middle
in the top left-hand corner.

00:03:56.746 --> 00:03:59.386 A:middle
We put our important
information in our header field.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:00.546 --> 00:04:02.716 A:middle
In this case, our gate
information is present there.

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:05.826 A:middle
Our users will know exactly
what gate they need to go to,

00:04:06.216 --> 00:04:07.816 A:middle
when boarding time arrives.

00:04:08.356 --> 00:04:12.646 A:middle
We put our important information
down in our primary fields.

00:04:13.606 --> 00:04:17.005 A:middle
And this particular case, we
have a flight that takes off

00:04:17.005 --> 00:04:20.046 A:middle
from Newark and arrives
in Stockholm.

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:25.326 A:middle
We also have auxiliary and
secondary fields and this is

00:04:25.326 --> 00:04:28.466 A:middle
where we put our nice go to
know pieces of information,

00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:30.196 A:middle
things like the seat number.

00:04:30.726 --> 00:04:34.806 A:middle
And, of course, we
have our bar code.

00:04:34.806 --> 00:04:36.296 A:middle
And this is that link.

00:04:36.686 --> 00:04:39.826 A:middle
It's the message that connects
the users to your system,

00:04:39.826 --> 00:04:42.526 A:middle
to be able to take action in the
real world, and in this case,

00:04:42.526 --> 00:04:46.786 A:middle
this boarding pass will allow
the user to board a flight.

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:50.646 A:middle
And we can flip this
to the back.

00:04:51.016 --> 00:04:53.396 A:middle
We call this the
back of the pass.

00:04:53.486 --> 00:04:54.346 A:middle
And you'll notice right away

00:04:54.346 --> 00:04:58.066 A:middle
on the very top you can
associate an app with this pass,

00:04:58.626 --> 00:05:02.926 A:middle
and appropriately we have the
United Airlines app associated

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:58.626 --> 00:05:02.926 A:middle
and appropriately we have the
United Airlines app associated

00:05:02.926 --> 00:05:03.556 A:middle
with this pass.

00:05:04.376 --> 00:05:06.326 A:middle
There are two options
for users here as well.

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:08.666 A:middle
To be able to automatically
update this pass,

00:05:08.706 --> 00:05:10.256 A:middle
that's very important
we're going touch

00:05:10.256 --> 00:05:12.956 A:middle
on that a little bit later in
our presentation to be able

00:05:12.956 --> 00:05:16.286 A:middle
to update these passes to
keep information up to date.

00:05:17.186 --> 00:05:20.006 A:middle
We can also turn on and
off relevancy on and off

00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:21.226 A:middle
on the back of the pass as well.

00:05:21.226 --> 00:05:24.246 A:middle
That's the option there,
Suggest Pass on Lock Screen.

00:05:24.586 --> 00:05:26.526 A:middle
And along with that, on
the back of the pass,

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:29.066 A:middle
with he have some other nice
to know pieces of information,

00:05:29.126 --> 00:05:34.386 A:middle
things like terms can go
open the back of the pass.

00:05:34.386 --> 00:05:35.546 A:middle
What makes a pass a pass?

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:40.586 A:middle
Let's take a look at this
beautiful MLB event ticket.

00:05:41.756 --> 00:05:45.426 A:middle
The pass is made from
a pass.json file.

00:05:45.426 --> 00:05:47.046 A:middle
The contents and the layout

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:49.136 A:middle
of this pass is defined
in that file.

00:05:49.136 --> 00:05:52.296 A:middle
And it just your standard JSON
file with keys and values.

00:05:52.816 --> 00:05:55.566 A:middle
In this case the keys and
values determine the content

00:05:55.716 --> 00:05:57.676 A:middle
and the styling and the
layout of this pass.

00:05:59.456 --> 00:06:02.666 A:middle
And this MLB pass also has
some really beautiful images.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:59.456 --> 00:06:02.666 A:middle
And this MLB pass also has
some really beautiful images.

00:06:02.666 --> 00:06:06.536 A:middle
We have a logo that's an image
on the top left-hand corner

00:06:07.456 --> 00:06:09.656 A:middle
and we have a strip image
that spans that pass.

00:06:09.656 --> 00:06:11.476 A:middle
It really makes that
pass come to life.

00:06:11.916 --> 00:06:14.306 A:middle
And when we package
all of these things

00:06:14.306 --> 00:06:18.236 A:middle
up together we get what
is called a PKPass file.

00:06:19.506 --> 00:06:21.516 A:middle
And the file hierarchy
looks something like this.

00:06:22.226 --> 00:06:25.106 A:middle
Your PKPass file will
contain the pass.json

00:06:25.256 --> 00:06:28.596 A:middle
and those images we talked
about and there are a couple

00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:30.396 A:middle
of other files in there
I want to point out.

00:06:31.306 --> 00:06:33.406 A:middle
First of all, there are
localized strings in here.

00:06:33.946 --> 00:06:35.636 A:middle
Yes, passes can be localized,

00:06:35.636 --> 00:06:37.296 A:middle
I will encourage
you guys to do so.

00:06:37.826 --> 00:06:40.866 A:middle
You'll also notice
on the bottom,

00:06:41.296 --> 00:06:43.546 A:middle
the manifest file
and a signature file.

00:06:44.686 --> 00:06:46.626 A:middle
Our passes are cryptographically
signed

00:06:46.746 --> 00:06:49.056 A:middle
so that their authenticity
can be verified

00:06:49.496 --> 00:06:52.616 A:middle
and that the users know that the
pass came from a known entity.

00:06:53.126 --> 00:06:54.636 A:middle
This is great.

00:06:55.036 --> 00:06:56.766 A:middle
So now with a PK pass file

00:06:56.766 --> 00:06:58.606 A:middle
and this is now just
a generic pass file.

00:06:58.606 --> 00:06:59.666 A:middle
How do we make this unique?

00:06:59.666 --> 00:07:01.636 A:middle
How do we make this your pass?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.666 --> 00:07:01.636 A:middle
How do we make this your pass?

00:07:02.416 --> 00:07:04.746 A:middle
Well we use three
different values to be able

00:07:04.746 --> 00:07:06.946 A:middle
to determine the
uniqueness of your pass.

00:07:08.486 --> 00:07:10.886 A:middle
The first one is
the teamIdentifier

00:07:10.886 --> 00:07:14.016 A:middle
and this is just a 10 character
string that you can find

00:07:14.016 --> 00:07:16.986 A:middle
in the developer portal and
we use this to entitle apps

00:07:17.866 --> 00:07:20.726 A:middle
to gain access via
PassKit, our framework.

00:07:21.236 --> 00:07:25.616 A:middle
The second value we use
is a passTypeIdentifier.

00:07:25.976 --> 00:07:29.296 A:middle
And now this defines the class
or the category of passes

00:07:29.396 --> 00:07:31.966 A:middle
that this particular pass is.

00:07:31.966 --> 00:07:34.446 A:middle
You register for this in the
developer portal as well.

00:07:34.846 --> 00:07:37.896 A:middle
We also use this value
to group passes together.

00:07:38.726 --> 00:07:42.226 A:middle
And lastly, we have
the pass serialNumber.

00:07:43.216 --> 00:07:45.556 A:middle
And now, this is unique
for every single pass.

00:07:45.796 --> 00:07:48.346 A:middle
And it's completely chosen
by you, and opaque to us.

00:07:49.566 --> 00:07:52.116 A:middle
Now, when we combine this
value, the serialNumber

00:07:52.586 --> 00:07:53.986 A:middle
with a passTypeIdentifier,

00:07:54.686 --> 00:07:58.806 A:middle
we get our guaranteed global
uniqueness for your pass.

00:07:59.596 --> 00:08:03.006 A:middle
Along with all of these
values, the pass.json is also

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:59.596 --> 00:08:03.006 A:middle
Along with all of these
values, the pass.json is also

00:08:03.006 --> 00:08:05.106 A:middle
where you declare
your pass' relevancy.

00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:06.866 A:middle
Let's take a look
at relevancy now.

00:08:08.036 --> 00:08:11.456 A:middle
Relevancy can be determined
by three different categories.

00:08:12.116 --> 00:08:14.196 A:middle
You can use date.

00:08:14.196 --> 00:08:16.306 A:middle
You can use location.

00:08:17.116 --> 00:08:18.576 A:middle
And you can use beacons.

00:08:18.896 --> 00:08:22.276 A:middle
And it's the combination
of these categories

00:08:22.466 --> 00:08:25.276 A:middle
that make these passes
really, really powerful.

00:08:25.276 --> 00:08:28.786 A:middle
So let's take a look at
how we implement relevancy

00:08:28.926 --> 00:08:30.856 A:middle
on our pass.json.

00:08:31.266 --> 00:08:32.086 A:middle
We have a few keys.

00:08:32.885 --> 00:08:33.535 A:middle
First of all, we're going

00:08:33.535 --> 00:08:35.616 A:middle
to take a look at
the locations key.

00:08:36.006 --> 00:08:38.226 A:middle
That takes an array
of dictionaries

00:08:38.596 --> 00:08:43.135 A:middle
and that dictionary will contain
in it a latitude, a longitude

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:44.726 A:middle
and an optional relevantText.

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:47.176 A:middle
This relevant text will
then appear when your users

00:08:47.266 --> 00:08:48.986 A:middle
in that locate or
near that location.

00:08:49.476 --> 00:08:52.606 A:middle
So it's good to declare
those to be able to clarify

00:08:52.606 --> 00:08:56.716 A:middle
to your user exactly why
that's shown to the user.

00:08:57.566 --> 00:08:59.416 A:middle
And then we have
the relevantDate,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:00.236 --> 00:09:03.666 A:middle
and that's just your standard
W3C format, relevantDate,

00:09:04.436 --> 00:09:06.466 A:middle
and then we have our beacons.

00:09:07.136 --> 00:09:10.156 A:middle
The beacons key is an array.

00:09:10.896 --> 00:09:12.496 A:middle
Inside that array
are dictionaries,

00:09:13.226 --> 00:09:16.736 A:middle
the proximityUUID will
uniquely identify your beacon.

00:09:17.306 --> 00:09:18.836 A:middle
Again, we have that relevantText

00:09:18.836 --> 00:09:20.816 A:middle
and the optional name
field here as well.

00:09:21.296 --> 00:09:22.726 A:middle
Again, it's when you combine all

00:09:22.726 --> 00:09:24.516 A:middle
of these relevancy
categories together is

00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:28.336 A:middle
when you make your passes
really, really powerful.

00:09:28.336 --> 00:09:30.086 A:middle
And it's a great surprise
in the live feature

00:09:30.086 --> 00:09:31.356 A:middle
for your users as well.

00:09:31.966 --> 00:09:35.406 A:middle
Passes are only interesting to
the user when the information

00:09:35.406 --> 00:09:37.276 A:middle
on them is up to date.

00:09:37.586 --> 00:09:39.816 A:middle
So how do we keep our
passes up to date?

00:09:39.816 --> 00:09:42.976 A:middle
Now, I'm going to give
a very high level glance

00:09:42.976 --> 00:09:45.176 A:middle
at how this works,
and I'm going to refer

00:09:45.176 --> 00:09:48.796 A:middle
to a WWDC talk we
gave back in 2012

00:09:49.006 --> 00:09:50.926 A:middle
that goes really
in-depth into this topic.

00:09:51.376 --> 00:09:52.446 A:middle
Let's take a look at this now.

00:09:54.576 --> 00:09:57.756 A:middle
So your server will implement
the Apple Push Service.

00:09:57.756 --> 00:10:01.766 A:middle
And we utilize the Apple Push
Service to start a pass' update.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:57.756 --> 00:10:01.766 A:middle
And we utilize the Apple Push
Service to start a pass' update.

00:10:03.046 --> 00:10:05.866 A:middle
We get pass down, a
passTypeIdentifier.

00:10:05.906 --> 00:10:08.476 A:middle
That's what we talked about
a couple of slides earlier.

00:10:09.646 --> 00:10:12.656 A:middle
With that passTypeIdentifier,
we then look at your pass.json

00:10:12.996 --> 00:10:15.716 A:middle
and look for the webService key.

00:10:16.746 --> 00:10:19.726 A:middle
That webService key will
contain a URL that we can hit

00:10:20.356 --> 00:10:21.886 A:middle
and ask for updated passes.

00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:26.026 A:middle
And then we get brand new
.pkpass files with updates

00:10:26.026 --> 00:10:29.836 A:middle
on them sent down to our devices
and we update the user's pass.

00:10:30.826 --> 00:10:33.146 A:middle
Now that's a very high level
view of how this works.

00:10:33.596 --> 00:10:37.366 A:middle
I would highly recommend going
back to that WWDC talk from 2012

00:10:37.836 --> 00:10:41.996 A:middle
and dig into how to implement
a web service for your passes.

00:10:42.876 --> 00:10:44.156 A:middle
Okay. This is great.

00:10:44.156 --> 00:10:47.136 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at how
we can programmatically get

00:10:47.136 --> 00:10:47.966 A:middle
to these passes.

00:10:48.516 --> 00:10:50.406 A:middle
We do have PassKit
after all inside iOS.

00:10:50.406 --> 00:10:51.916 A:middle
Let's see how we use it.

00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:54.776 A:middle
The main class that
we're going to be using

00:10:54.776 --> 00:10:57.836 A:middle
in PassKit is PKPassLibrary.

00:10:57.836 --> 00:10:59.246 A:middle
This is your link.

00:10:59.716 --> 00:11:02.296 A:middle
This is what you are
going to use to be able

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.716 --> 00:11:02.296 A:middle
This is what you are
going to use to be able

00:11:02.296 --> 00:11:03.906 A:middle
to query your user's passes,

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:07.276 A:middle
and access to it is
gated by entitlements.

00:11:07.756 --> 00:11:09.256 A:middle
We talked about that
a little bit earlier,

00:11:09.736 --> 00:11:11.606 A:middle
using your passTypeIdentifier.

00:11:12.816 --> 00:11:15.636 A:middle
Let's take a look at some of the
methods inside PKPassLibrary.

00:11:17.356 --> 00:11:20.356 A:middle
First we have a function
that asks,

00:11:20.996 --> 00:11:23.376 A:middle
is the PassLibrary
available on this device.

00:11:23.376 --> 00:11:25.456 A:middle
This is a very good
question to ask.

00:11:26.616 --> 00:11:32.296 A:middle
When we get a positive answer
back, you can then get passes.

00:11:32.296 --> 00:11:35.046 A:middle
When you call passes, you will
get back an array of PKPass.

00:11:35.306 --> 00:11:39.376 A:middle
And these are all the passes
that you are entitled to see.

00:11:40.656 --> 00:11:42.936 A:middle
You can also find a
particular, a specific pass

00:11:42.936 --> 00:11:43.486 A:middle
that you are looking

00:11:43.486 --> 00:11:45.766 A:middle
for by calling
passWithPassTypeIdentifier,

00:11:46.196 --> 00:11:49.776 A:middle
serialNumber, passing
it the identifier string

00:11:49.826 --> 00:11:50.916 A:middle
and the serial number string.

00:11:50.916 --> 00:11:52.886 A:middle
That will get you the exact
pass that you are looking for.

00:11:53.386 --> 00:11:56.256 A:middle
We also have another
one called passesOfType,

00:11:57.086 --> 00:11:58.086 A:middle
passing a PKPassType.

00:11:58.086 --> 00:12:00.036 A:middle
And you may wonder what are
all the different pass types?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.086 --> 00:12:00.036 A:middle
And you may wonder what are
all the different pass types?

00:12:00.036 --> 00:12:02.816 A:middle
Well here they are
there's Barcode,

00:12:03.346 --> 00:12:05.216 A:middle
there's Payment and there's Any.

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:08.546 A:middle
So you may ask yourself, Danvin,

00:12:08.546 --> 00:12:10.086 A:middle
why would you want
to get passes?

00:12:10.086 --> 00:12:11.606 A:middle
Why do you want to see
your user's passes.

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:14.056 A:middle
Well as a developer
you may want to know --

00:12:14.056 --> 00:12:18.396 A:middle
any of your passes that your
users already have on the system

00:12:18.396 --> 00:12:20.976 A:middle
so you don't duplicate
things again.

00:12:20.976 --> 00:12:23.516 A:middle
For payment passes, we're
going talk about earlier,

00:12:23.516 --> 00:12:26.516 A:middle
banks and other merchants
may want to be able

00:12:26.516 --> 00:12:30.386 A:middle
to activate payment passes
from your users' pass library.

00:12:30.386 --> 00:12:32.866 A:middle
We will get into that when we
get into the Apple Pay section.

00:12:33.676 --> 00:12:36.246 A:middle
Now we have our passes
together, they're beautiful,

00:12:36.246 --> 00:12:38.296 A:middle
they're relevant, they're up
to date, how do we get them

00:12:38.296 --> 00:12:39.546 A:middle
in the hands of our users.

00:12:40.806 --> 00:12:45.316 A:middle
Well the PKPass file is pretty
portable, so you can host them

00:12:45.316 --> 00:12:48.206 A:middle
on a website, you can
email them to your users,

00:12:48.206 --> 00:12:50.746 A:middle
you can even include
them inside your apps.

00:12:52.326 --> 00:12:54.916 A:middle
And I want to point one
neat little feature,

00:12:55.116 --> 00:12:56.636 A:middle
we give special treatment

00:12:56.636 --> 00:12:59.876 A:middle
to PKPass files inside
our iOS apps like Mail.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:00.426 --> 00:13:03.426 A:middle
When we receive a PKPass file

00:13:03.796 --> 00:13:07.176 A:middle
in our email Mail will give
it some special treatment

00:13:07.176 --> 00:13:11.106 A:middle
with this action button and you
can see exactly what PKPass file

00:13:11.106 --> 00:13:13.186 A:middle
is in that email.

00:13:13.536 --> 00:13:17.446 A:middle
And if you host this on a
website or put this on an app,

00:13:17.446 --> 00:13:19.116 A:middle
we even have a banner for you,

00:13:19.116 --> 00:13:22.866 A:middle
you can include inside your
sites and on your apps.

00:13:23.716 --> 00:13:25.556 A:middle
But you may be telling
me, Danvin,

00:13:25.556 --> 00:13:27.426 A:middle
you know that says Passbook.

00:13:28.156 --> 00:13:29.826 A:middle
I know. I know this
says Passbook.

00:13:29.826 --> 00:13:33.746 A:middle
This is a good little
transition for me to talk about.

00:13:33.826 --> 00:13:35.206 A:middle
We are in the middle
of a transition.

00:13:35.416 --> 00:13:37.486 A:middle
We are moving from
Passbook to Wallet.

00:13:37.996 --> 00:13:40.886 A:middle
And for now, in the public, we
are still known as Passbook.

00:13:41.026 --> 00:13:41.916 A:middle
So be aware of that.

00:13:42.516 --> 00:13:45.316 A:middle
But please stay tuned as
we get closer and closer

00:13:45.316 --> 00:13:50.056 A:middle
to iOS 9's release, we will keep
you up to date on this topic.

00:13:50.116 --> 00:13:52.706 A:middle
I'm really glad we got
to talk about that.

00:13:53.506 --> 00:13:57.326 A:middle
But let's say we want to add
these passes programmatically,

00:13:57.386 --> 00:13:58.196 A:middle
how would you do that?

00:13:58.956 --> 00:14:00.376 A:middle
Well, PKPassLibrary does that.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:58.956 --> 00:14:00.376 A:middle
Well, PKPassLibrary does that.

00:14:01.076 --> 00:14:03.846 A:middle
We have a function in
there called addPasses.

00:14:05.086 --> 00:14:06.676 A:middle
That's right, multiple passes.

00:14:06.716 --> 00:14:07.756 A:middle
Why would you want to do this?

00:14:07.756 --> 00:14:12.926 A:middle
Well, consider a flight with
multiple segments and you want

00:14:12.926 --> 00:14:16.036 A:middle
to be able to ingest all
the passes all at once.

00:14:16.826 --> 00:14:18.016 A:middle
This is a great way to do that.

00:14:18.016 --> 00:14:20.906 A:middle
So addPasses
withCompletionHandler will alert

00:14:20.906 --> 00:14:23.986 A:middle
the user with a small
and very subtle dialog

00:14:24.066 --> 00:14:26.236 A:middle
to add these passes
into their library.

00:14:26.286 --> 00:14:29.816 A:middle
Please make sure before you call
this that you already denoted

00:14:29.816 --> 00:14:33.506 A:middle
to the user that they
are about to add a pass.

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:36.516 A:middle
We do have one more way to add
passes into the pass library

00:14:36.516 --> 00:14:39.706 A:middle
and that's using
PKAddPassesViewController.

00:14:40.606 --> 00:14:43.056 A:middle
you may have seen this before if
you have added passes to Mail.

00:14:43.456 --> 00:14:46.316 A:middle
It looks something like
this, you tap on a pass,

00:14:47.426 --> 00:14:49.116 A:middle
they call
PKAddPassesViewController

00:14:49.186 --> 00:14:51.776 A:middle
and we get this nice beautiful
view controller fully rendered

00:14:51.776 --> 00:14:55.456 A:middle
out with an action up top
for the user to choose.

00:14:56.486 --> 00:14:57.096 A:middle
How does this work.

00:14:57.496 --> 00:14:59.996 A:middle
PKAddPassesViewerController
has a function

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:00.096 --> 00:15:02.216 A:middle
that checks can you add
passes to this device?

00:15:03.156 --> 00:15:05.396 A:middle
And then like before, you
can add a single pass,

00:15:06.896 --> 00:15:07.746 A:middle
or multiple passes.

00:15:08.156 --> 00:15:09.376 A:middle
So you knit one of these guys

00:15:09.486 --> 00:15:12.076 A:middle
and then you just show this
view controller and we take care

00:15:12.076 --> 00:15:13.466 A:middle
of rendering that pass for you.

00:15:14.626 --> 00:15:17.166 A:middle
Great. Now we can add passes.

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:18.936 A:middle
We can keep them updated.

00:15:18.936 --> 00:15:19.896 A:middle
We can keep them relevant.

00:15:21.186 --> 00:15:23.196 A:middle
But how do we keep
these passes engaging?

00:15:23.486 --> 00:15:23.826 A:middle
All right.

00:15:23.826 --> 00:15:25.376 A:middle
We want our users
to keep coming back

00:15:25.376 --> 00:15:26.796 A:middle
and take a look at our passes.

00:15:27.346 --> 00:15:30.486 A:middle
So I have a few tips for you
to keep our passes engaging.

00:15:31.376 --> 00:15:33.816 A:middle
As I mentioned before
relevancy is a big deal.

00:15:33.886 --> 00:15:36.486 A:middle
Relevancy will give that
big surprise in the life,

00:15:36.926 --> 00:15:38.846 A:middle
kind of feel for the users.

00:15:40.176 --> 00:15:41.486 A:middle
You want to keep
our passes updated.

00:15:41.486 --> 00:15:43.366 A:middle
For example, this pass,
this boarding pass,

00:15:44.106 --> 00:15:48.066 A:middle
it's useless unless we have
the latest gate information.

00:15:49.386 --> 00:15:53.546 A:middle
Users want to come back and
keep looking at your passes.

00:15:53.696 --> 00:15:54.586 A:middle
Images are great.

00:15:55.116 --> 00:15:56.656 A:middle
For example, this MLB
pass that we looked

00:15:56.656 --> 00:16:00.136 A:middle
at has this strip image that
spans the entirety of the pass.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:56.656 --> 00:16:00.136 A:middle
at has this strip image that
spans the entirety of the pass.

00:16:00.916 --> 00:16:03.196 A:middle
It really brings life
and also brings clarity

00:16:03.196 --> 00:16:05.836 A:middle
as to what this pass is
actually for and what it does.

00:16:06.516 --> 00:16:07.636 A:middle
This is called a strip image.

00:16:07.806 --> 00:16:09.556 A:middle
You notice that there's no
extra information there.

00:16:09.556 --> 00:16:10.766 A:middle
It's just for context.

00:16:10.766 --> 00:16:11.486 A:middle
It's beautiful!

00:16:12.396 --> 00:16:15.216 A:middle
And lastly, I want to
talk about formatting.

00:16:16.676 --> 00:16:18.456 A:middle
Formatting is tricky.

00:16:19.056 --> 00:16:20.276 A:middle
But we take care
of this for you.

00:16:20.516 --> 00:16:22.346 A:middle
And now we know we
have different devices

00:16:22.346 --> 00:16:23.476 A:middle
with different screen sizes.

00:16:23.476 --> 00:16:27.496 A:middle
And so what I recommend is you
take a look at our HI guidelines

00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:30.986 A:middle
on the website follow them
and we will do our very best

00:16:30.986 --> 00:16:35.686 A:middle
to make your passes look really
great on all of our devices.

00:16:37.016 --> 00:16:39.366 A:middle
Great. These passes have
been really, really useful.

00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:41.436 A:middle
They really let us take
action in the real world.

00:16:42.376 --> 00:16:45.096 A:middle
But they are not as slick
as what that experience

00:16:45.096 --> 00:16:46.116 A:middle
with Apple Pay is yet.

00:16:47.186 --> 00:16:49.576 A:middle
So how do we make that
experience a lot better?

00:16:50.126 --> 00:16:52.586 A:middle
Well, let's talk about
where we go from here.

00:16:53.126 --> 00:16:55.956 A:middle
Let me give you a scenario.

00:16:57.116 --> 00:16:58.356 A:middle
So the other day, I go

00:16:58.356 --> 00:17:01.886 A:middle
to my local neighborhood grocery
store, and I pick up my things

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:58.356 --> 00:17:01.886 A:middle
to my local neighborhood grocery
store, and I pick up my things

00:17:02.106 --> 00:17:03.116 A:middle
and I'm ready to check out.

00:17:03.526 --> 00:17:05.376 A:middle
Great, they take Apple Pay.

00:17:05.516 --> 00:17:08.526 A:middle
As I head to the terminal, the
clerk is ringing up my things

00:17:08.526 --> 00:17:11.336 A:middle
and I get my phone ready
to pay with Apple Pay.

00:17:12.816 --> 00:17:13.116 A:middle
All right.

00:17:13.996 --> 00:17:16.396 A:middle
They are done ringing up my
things and I bring my phone

00:17:16.396 --> 00:17:17.156 A:middle
to the terminal and...

00:17:17.246 --> 00:17:19.316 A:middle
do you have a loyalty
pass with us?

00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:21.906 A:middle
I think I do.

00:17:21.906 --> 00:17:25.935 A:middle
The clerk is really -- really
adamant about this loyalty card.

00:17:26.185 --> 00:17:28.306 A:middle
I think it's in that
big fat wallet of mine.

00:17:28.306 --> 00:17:30.426 A:middle
Oh, I can't find it right now.

00:17:30.426 --> 00:17:31.376 A:middle
I know it's on my phone number.

00:17:31.376 --> 00:17:32.756 A:middle
It's got to be registered
with my phone number.

00:17:32.806 --> 00:17:34.686 A:middle
I blurt my phone
number to the clerk.

00:17:35.976 --> 00:17:38.136 A:middle
Nope. It's not registered
with that phone number.

00:17:38.536 --> 00:17:41.776 A:middle
I'm frustrated and the
line is two or three deep.

00:17:42.016 --> 00:17:44.016 A:middle
I just blurt out my
mom's phone number

00:17:44.016 --> 00:17:45.876 A:middle
because I know my mom
has one of these things.

00:17:46.346 --> 00:17:47.436 A:middle
Great. That works!

00:17:47.956 --> 00:17:49.086 A:middle
And I now can Apple Pay

00:17:49.126 --> 00:17:51.486 A:middle
and I grab my things
and I'm out the door.

00:17:52.206 --> 00:17:54.496 A:middle
So a lot of bad things
happen there.

00:17:55.646 --> 00:17:57.986 A:middle
For me as a consumer,
I just want to pay.

00:17:58.956 --> 00:18:00.946 A:middle
I want to get my
things and be done.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.956 --> 00:18:00.946 A:middle
I want to get my
things and be done.

00:18:00.946 --> 00:18:05.456 A:middle
For the merchant, they just
got the completely wrong

00:18:05.456 --> 00:18:06.296 A:middle
loyalty information.

00:18:06.296 --> 00:18:08.476 A:middle
They got my mom's loyalty
information, not mine.

00:18:09.016 --> 00:18:11.086 A:middle
So we want to make this better.

00:18:12.156 --> 00:18:14.626 A:middle
And that's why we are
introducing passes

00:18:14.626 --> 00:18:16.326 A:middle
that work with Apple Pay.

00:18:16.786 --> 00:18:21.846 A:middle
Passes that work with Apple
Pay transmit your loyalty

00:18:21.846 --> 00:18:25.786 A:middle
information, contactlessly along
with your Apple Pay transaction.

00:18:27.316 --> 00:18:30.646 A:middle
We use the Value Added
Services Protocol

00:18:30.686 --> 00:18:33.076 A:middle
and we have been working with
major terminal manufacturers

00:18:33.356 --> 00:18:35.456 A:middle
for the adoption of
this new protocol.

00:18:36.536 --> 00:18:38.846 A:middle
So now, my scenario
looks more like this.

00:18:40.096 --> 00:18:43.036 A:middle
I go to my friendly
neighborhood Walgreens.

00:18:44.636 --> 00:18:48.506 A:middle
They take Apple Pay, great,
I use the new iOS feature

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:52.206 A:middle
and double tap on my home
button and I can prearm my card.

00:18:52.206 --> 00:18:54.896 A:middle
I can get my card ready before
I even head up to the terminal.

00:18:54.936 --> 00:18:58.736 A:middle
Great. My card is ready and I
head up to pay for my things.

00:18:59.866 --> 00:19:01.726 A:middle
When I put my phone
on the terminal,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:59.866 --> 00:19:01.726 A:middle
When I put my phone
on the terminal,

00:19:02.826 --> 00:19:05.616 A:middle
my Walgreen's loyalty
information is transmitted

00:19:05.616 --> 00:19:08.116 A:middle
contactlessly, along with
my Apple Pay information,

00:19:08.396 --> 00:19:09.986 A:middle
all in one tap.

00:19:11.366 --> 00:19:11.776 A:middle
That's it!

00:19:12.946 --> 00:19:15.356 A:middle
I give a friendly
smile and a thank you

00:19:15.356 --> 00:19:17.316 A:middle
to the clerk and
I'm out the door.

00:19:17.876 --> 00:19:20.106 A:middle
That is great!

00:19:21.176 --> 00:19:24.056 A:middle
That makes the process
a lot more smooth.

00:19:24.976 --> 00:19:25.736 A:middle
So how do we do this?

00:19:25.736 --> 00:19:29.556 A:middle
How do we add this
feature into your passes?

00:19:30.246 --> 00:19:31.046 A:middle
We have a new key.

00:19:31.416 --> 00:19:32.756 A:middle
It's pass.json.

00:19:33.516 --> 00:19:40.126 A:middle
It's nfc. Nfc is a a
dictionary that takes a message.

00:19:40.126 --> 00:19:43.256 A:middle
Just kind of like a bar code,
this is the loyalty information

00:19:43.256 --> 00:19:44.886 A:middle
or anything that
links this user,

00:19:44.886 --> 00:19:46.766 A:middle
this identity to your system.

00:19:47.496 --> 00:19:50.156 A:middle
We have an optional
encryptionPublicKey.

00:19:50.686 --> 00:19:53.236 A:middle
And this guarantees
authenticity,

00:19:53.236 --> 00:19:55.806 A:middle
this is something
handshake yourself

00:19:56.036 --> 00:19:58.726 A:middle
between merchant
and your terminal.

00:19:59.716 --> 00:20:03.656 A:middle
So this is how you
implement passes that work

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.716 --> 00:20:03.656 A:middle
So this is how you
implement passes that work

00:20:03.656 --> 00:20:05.786 A:middle
with Apple Pay on your passes.

00:20:05.786 --> 00:20:08.066 A:middle
And now if you are a
merchant or a terminal maker

00:20:08.066 --> 00:20:10.946 A:middle
and you are interested by
this, please come see us.

00:20:11.536 --> 00:20:13.816 A:middle
Our developer relations
team will be here this week

00:20:13.816 --> 00:20:14.816 A:middle
and you can contact them.

00:20:14.816 --> 00:20:17.856 A:middle
I will give you the contact
information after this talk.

00:20:18.176 --> 00:20:19.736 A:middle
And let them know
you are interested

00:20:19.736 --> 00:20:24.076 A:middle
and we will get you started with
passes that work with Apple Pay.

00:20:24.956 --> 00:20:27.926 A:middle
Speaking of Apple Pay,
Apple Pay has been great,

00:20:28.146 --> 00:20:29.016 A:middle
like I mentioned before.

00:20:29.066 --> 00:20:32.796 A:middle
We have now enabled contactless
payment on our phones,

00:20:32.866 --> 00:20:37.076 A:middle
on our watches, and even
we have enabled APIs

00:20:37.076 --> 00:20:39.756 A:middle
so you can take Apple
Pay inside your apps.

00:20:41.216 --> 00:20:44.136 A:middle
And Apple Pay is great because
there's a seamless payment

00:20:44.136 --> 00:20:45.946 A:middle
experience for your users.

00:20:46.286 --> 00:20:48.036 A:middle
And merchants are seeing
higher conversion rates

00:20:48.356 --> 00:20:52.116 A:middle
across the board so we
want to encourage our users

00:20:52.116 --> 00:20:54.986 A:middle
to add Apple Pay cards
into their devices.

00:20:55.826 --> 00:20:56.576 A:middle
How do we do that?

00:20:56.576 --> 00:20:58.966 A:middle
We are giving you a couple
of APIs to enable this.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:00.046 --> 00:21:01.196 A:middle
There's two.

00:21:01.946 --> 00:21:05.946 A:middle
The first one will take your
users directly to our Wallet app

00:21:05.946 --> 00:21:06.886 A:middle
and start setup from there.

00:21:08.036 --> 00:21:09.756 A:middle
And a second one,
that allows you to set

00:21:09.756 --> 00:21:11.976 A:middle
up these cards from
within your app.

00:21:13.056 --> 00:21:14.116 A:middle
Let's take a look
at that first one.

00:21:15.566 --> 00:21:19.056 A:middle
It's in PKPassLibrary
and it's very simple.

00:21:20.606 --> 00:21:23.086 A:middle
We call openPaymentSetup.

00:21:23.086 --> 00:21:25.206 A:middle
And that will take your
user directly into Wallet,

00:21:25.476 --> 00:21:27.216 A:middle
and start the setup flow.

00:21:27.626 --> 00:21:29.546 A:middle
And now with our new
features in iOS 9,

00:21:29.726 --> 00:21:32.546 A:middle
your users can go really
easily back into your app

00:21:32.746 --> 00:21:34.556 A:middle
and we leave a little bread
crumb for them to tap on

00:21:34.556 --> 00:21:37.336 A:middle
and go back into your
app and do continue

00:21:37.336 --> 00:21:38.406 A:middle
to do whatever they were doing.

00:21:38.656 --> 00:21:39.496 A:middle
Hopefully shopping.

00:21:40.446 --> 00:21:45.846 A:middle
And if you are a bank or if you
are a merchant with a store card

00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:47.056 A:middle
or a private label card,

00:21:47.056 --> 00:21:49.586 A:middle
you want to have this
happen inside your own app,

00:21:50.356 --> 00:21:51.656 A:middle
we have an API for that as well.

00:21:52.426 --> 00:21:53.756 A:middle
It's actually a view controller,

00:21:54.266 --> 00:21:56.926 A:middle
it's
PKAddPaymentPassViewController.

00:21:57.876 --> 00:22:01.256 A:middle
And of course we need to check
whether this particular device

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:57.876 --> 00:22:01.256 A:middle
And of course we need to check
whether this particular device

00:22:01.356 --> 00:22:03.426 A:middle
can add a payment pass or not.

00:22:04.316 --> 00:22:08.476 A:middle
When we find out it can, we set
one of these up, we can knit it

00:22:08.476 --> 00:22:12.186 A:middle
with a requestConfiguration
and we pass into it a delegate.

00:22:13.356 --> 00:22:16.006 A:middle
Now this delegate that you
implement inside your app,

00:22:16.706 --> 00:22:19.316 A:middle
will form together using
those pieces of information,

00:22:19.316 --> 00:22:24.666 A:middle
like the nonceSignature, will
form up a AddPaymentPassRequest.

00:22:25.546 --> 00:22:27.616 A:middle
We can really dig into
this for a long time.

00:22:27.616 --> 00:22:29.536 A:middle
I really don't have time
in this particular session

00:22:29.536 --> 00:22:30.246 A:middle
to dig into this.

00:22:30.616 --> 00:22:32.346 A:middle
So please refer to
your documentation

00:22:32.346 --> 00:22:35.796 A:middle
if you have any questions
about how to use this class.

00:22:36.706 --> 00:22:39.006 A:middle
And this class will be entitled.

00:22:39.086 --> 00:22:40.686 A:middle
So please let us know
as well if you want

00:22:40.686 --> 00:22:44.626 A:middle
to use this inside your app.

00:22:44.706 --> 00:22:48.956 A:middle
Another necessary step that
our users might need to take

00:22:48.956 --> 00:22:53.206 A:middle
when they are adding a payment
pass inside Apple Pay is a

00:22:53.496 --> 00:22:56.086 A:middle
payment pass verification
or second factor auth

00:22:56.086 --> 00:22:57.686 A:middle
as some people know it.

00:22:57.976 --> 00:23:03.876 A:middle
And along with the typical flow,
like using SMS or a phone call

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:57.976 --> 00:23:03.876 A:middle
And along with the typical flow,
like using SMS or a phone call

00:23:03.876 --> 00:23:07.306 A:middle
or email, another option
we offer is using an app.

00:23:08.256 --> 00:23:10.126 A:middle
We see here Capital
One using their app

00:23:10.216 --> 00:23:12.806 A:middle
to verify their user's identity.

00:23:13.626 --> 00:23:14.286 A:middle
How do we do this?

00:23:15.346 --> 00:23:17.906 A:middle
Well, we give you guys a
couple of APIs to be able

00:23:17.906 --> 00:23:22.616 A:middle
to allow this inside
of your apps.

00:23:22.836 --> 00:23:24.486 A:middle
It's also in PKPassLibrary.

00:23:25.706 --> 00:23:27.846 A:middle
You check first, is
there a payment pass

00:23:27.846 --> 00:23:28.916 A:middle
activation available?

00:23:30.376 --> 00:23:33.616 A:middle
Remember when we
were pulling PKPasses

00:23:33.806 --> 00:23:35.196 A:middle
out of the user's library?

00:23:35.196 --> 00:23:36.786 A:middle
Well this is where it's useful.

00:23:37.266 --> 00:23:42.796 A:middle
You can pass into this call,
that PKPaymentPass and pass

00:23:42.796 --> 00:23:44.946 A:middle
into it some activation data

00:23:45.736 --> 00:23:47.366 A:middle
and you'll get a
completion back whether

00:23:47.366 --> 00:23:49.486 A:middle
that activation was
successful or not.

00:23:50.646 --> 00:23:55.106 A:middle
That's how you can implement
verification inside your apps.

00:23:56.326 --> 00:23:58.416 A:middle
So our phones have been
really, really popular

00:23:58.666 --> 00:24:00.426 A:middle
and there's awesome and really,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:58.666 --> 00:24:00.426 A:middle
and there's awesome and really,

00:24:00.426 --> 00:24:01.696 A:middle
really great accessories
out there.

00:24:02.786 --> 00:24:05.996 A:middle
Some of them emit a field and
we want to be good players

00:24:06.446 --> 00:24:07.366 A:middle
with those accessories.

00:24:07.366 --> 00:24:09.446 A:middle
We are announcing with iOS 9,

00:24:09.846 --> 00:24:12.516 A:middle
a contactless interface
suppression API.

00:24:14.146 --> 00:24:17.486 A:middle
What this will do is temporarily
disable the user interface.

00:24:18.036 --> 00:24:19.786 A:middle
It's the sheet of
passes that you see

00:24:20.956 --> 00:24:23.156 A:middle
and this will require
a user's permission.

00:24:23.686 --> 00:24:25.886 A:middle
Let's take a look
at how we do this.

00:24:26.596 --> 00:24:29.456 A:middle
It's in that PKPassLibrary
again.

00:24:30.446 --> 00:24:33.276 A:middle
PKPassLibrary has a
new function called

00:24:33.596 --> 00:24:38.286 A:middle
requestAutomaticPassPresentation
SuppressionWithResponseHandler.

00:24:38.846 --> 00:24:39.446 A:middle
It's a mouthful!

00:24:40.146 --> 00:24:44.776 A:middle
And what you will get
back is a response result

00:24:44.776 --> 00:24:46.636 A:middle
of what the user
decides, whether

00:24:46.636 --> 00:24:50.806 A:middle
or not they will allow
suppression inside your app.

00:24:50.806 --> 00:24:52.246 A:middle
You also get back
a request token.

00:24:52.246 --> 00:24:54.866 A:middle
Then you can use that request
token for this next call

00:24:55.406 --> 00:24:57.506 A:middle
to endAutomaticPassPresentation.

00:24:57.986 --> 00:24:59.676 A:middle
Pass into it, that requestToken,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:00.736 --> 00:25:04.026 A:middle
and the payment UI will
appear again inside your app.

00:25:04.476 --> 00:25:07.896 A:middle
You can also check whether
automaticPassPresentation

00:25:07.936 --> 00:25:09.336 A:middle
Suppression is already occurring

00:25:09.466 --> 00:25:11.176 A:middle
by using this function
right here.

00:25:11.796 --> 00:25:13.956 A:middle
As I mentioned before,
it is temporary.

00:25:13.956 --> 00:25:16.016 A:middle
So if your app is suspended,

00:25:16.646 --> 00:25:19.146 A:middle
the payment pass UI will
appear again for the user

00:25:19.266 --> 00:25:22.046 A:middle
or if it's been 24 hours
after your last requests,

00:25:22.386 --> 00:25:25.106 A:middle
you will need to re-request
your user's permission again.

00:25:25.646 --> 00:25:28.696 A:middle
These classes and these
calls are entitled.

00:25:28.696 --> 00:25:32.056 A:middle
So please let us know if
you would like to use them.

00:25:32.196 --> 00:25:37.286 A:middle
Along with Apple Pay, last fall
we also introduced Apple Watch.

00:25:37.806 --> 00:25:42.376 A:middle
And now I'm really happy to
announce that in watchOS 2,

00:25:42.376 --> 00:25:47.036 A:middle
we are bringing full PassKit
support to Apple Watch.

00:25:47.476 --> 00:25:52.396 A:middle
And this is really great because
now on Apple Watch, you can add,

00:25:53.086 --> 00:25:56.166 A:middle
you can remove, you can query
passes just like up doing

00:25:57.026 --> 00:25:59.846 A:middle
on our phones previously.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:01.176 --> 00:26:03.846 A:middle
So full PassKit support
is coming to Apple Watch

00:26:04.576 --> 00:26:08.076 A:middle
and watchOS 2, there's
another thing I want to talk

00:26:08.076 --> 00:26:10.686 A:middle
about in regards to Apple Watch
and that's the screen size.

00:26:11.876 --> 00:26:15.706 A:middle
Working with a lot smaller real
estate space on Apple Watch,

00:26:15.706 --> 00:26:16.846 A:middle
and I want to point this out,

00:26:16.846 --> 00:26:19.386 A:middle
because passes are drawn
a little differently

00:26:20.236 --> 00:26:21.046 A:middle
on Apple Watch.

00:26:22.046 --> 00:26:23.156 A:middle
This is a pretty cool graphic.

00:26:23.726 --> 00:26:27.646 A:middle
This is what a pass rendered
on Apple Watch looks like.

00:26:27.646 --> 00:26:30.056 A:middle
As you can see this
is our MLB pass

00:26:30.846 --> 00:26:31.766 A:middle
from a couple of slides back.

00:26:33.096 --> 00:26:36.016 A:middle
And you will notice right away
it looks a little different.

00:26:37.126 --> 00:26:39.096 A:middle
That strip image
is no longer there.

00:26:39.746 --> 00:26:43.656 A:middle
And, in fact, we don't even
have a back of the pass.

00:26:43.656 --> 00:26:46.416 A:middle
So take a look and remember,
passes do look different

00:26:46.416 --> 00:26:48.356 A:middle
on different devices,
especially on Apple Watch.

00:26:48.356 --> 00:26:51.746 A:middle
So consider that when you
are designing your passes

00:26:51.836 --> 00:26:52.736 A:middle
and implementing them.

00:26:53.186 --> 00:26:56.026 A:middle
But, of course, if you
follow the HI guidelines,

00:26:56.146 --> 00:27:01.226 A:middle
we will promise and do our best
to make your passes look great

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:56.146 --> 00:27:01.226 A:middle
we will promise and do our best
to make your passes look great

00:27:01.516 --> 00:27:04.486 A:middle
on every single one
of our devices.

00:27:04.836 --> 00:27:07.146 A:middle
So that's PassKit
and Apple Watch.

00:27:07.576 --> 00:27:10.996 A:middle
There's one more thing
I do want to talk about.

00:27:11.736 --> 00:27:12.996 A:middle
And that's 1D bar codes.

00:27:13.846 --> 00:27:17.106 A:middle
We have been getting a lot
of requests for 1D barcodes

00:27:17.656 --> 00:27:20.846 A:middle
and I'm really glad
to say that iOS 9,

00:27:20.846 --> 00:27:23.426 A:middle
we are bringing 1D
Barcode support to Wallet.

00:27:23.886 --> 00:27:23.976 A:middle
Yeah.

00:27:23.976 --> 00:27:24.756 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:24.756 --> 00:27:28.726 A:middle
I'm glad you are glad.

00:27:29.466 --> 00:27:32.596 A:middle
So we have a new barcode format.

00:27:33.126 --> 00:27:35.466 A:middle
It's PKBarcodeFormatCode128.

00:27:36.286 --> 00:27:39.456 A:middle
You may ask what about my users
that are who are still on iOS 8

00:27:39.456 --> 00:27:40.766 A:middle
and below, are they
going to get this?

00:27:40.766 --> 00:27:45.746 A:middle
Well, no. That's why you
will have this fallback.

00:27:46.546 --> 00:27:47.916 A:middle
We still have that barcode key.

00:27:48.266 --> 00:27:50.676 A:middle
That barcode key is
very, very important

00:27:50.676 --> 00:27:53.486 A:middle
but we have here is
implementing that 2D barcode.

00:27:53.896 --> 00:27:58.496 A:middle
We have a new barcodes, plural,
key that is an array that takes

00:27:58.496 --> 00:27:59.886 A:middle
in a dictionary of barcodes.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:00.396 --> 00:28:03.896 A:middle
So, as you can see, we have a
new barcodes array here that has

00:28:03.896 --> 00:28:05.866 A:middle
in the first dictionary,

00:28:05.866 --> 00:28:09.396 A:middle
a barcode with
PKBarcodeFormatCode128.

00:28:09.396 --> 00:28:10.886 A:middle
And that's the 1D barcode.

00:28:11.436 --> 00:28:13.406 A:middle
So please, please, as you
are implementing this,

00:28:14.236 --> 00:28:17.966 A:middle
do me a favor, please verify
your system supports 1D barcodes

00:28:18.756 --> 00:28:20.976 A:middle
and what I really mean
is optical scanners.

00:28:21.476 --> 00:28:25.856 A:middle
And please remember to
fall back to 2D barcodes

00:28:25.856 --> 00:28:27.866 A:middle
so that your users on iOS 8

00:28:27.866 --> 00:28:30.716 A:middle
and below have a
barcode on their passes.

00:28:31.776 --> 00:28:32.076 A:middle
All right.

00:28:32.166 --> 00:28:34.106 A:middle
I have done a lot of
talking this morning.

00:28:34.106 --> 00:28:38.216 A:middle
If I had to say that you
should remember something

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:42.146 A:middle
from this session, it's
these things: We're solving

00:28:42.146 --> 00:28:43.426 A:middle
that overstuffed wallet problem.

00:28:44.346 --> 00:28:45.586 A:middle
We don't want that
wallet anymore.

00:28:45.736 --> 00:28:47.256 A:middle
We don't want to see
that wallet anymore.

00:28:47.896 --> 00:28:48.996 A:middle
We do that with passes.

00:28:49.936 --> 00:28:52.996 A:middle
Passes allow us to take
action in the real world.

00:28:53.576 --> 00:28:54.896 A:middle
They are really easy
to integrate

00:28:54.896 --> 00:28:56.746 A:middle
into your apps, into your flow.

00:28:57.616 --> 00:29:00.826 A:middle
And passes when they are
engaging really keep your users

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:57.616 --> 00:29:00.826 A:middle
And passes when they are
engaging really keep your users

00:29:01.556 --> 00:29:04.586 A:middle
interactive and interested
in your systems.

00:29:05.486 --> 00:29:06.806 A:middle
And I want to remind you

00:29:06.806 --> 00:29:08.126 A:middle
to integrate Apple
Pay into your apps.

00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:11.016 A:middle
Encourage your users to use
Apple Pay into their apps.

00:29:11.796 --> 00:29:14.786 A:middle
Remember you want that smooth
and seamless checkout flow

00:29:14.786 --> 00:29:17.316 A:middle
and we also want the
higher conversion rates

00:29:17.506 --> 00:29:18.106 A:middle
for our merchants.

00:29:19.406 --> 00:29:21.616 A:middle
I didn't even talk about
integrating Apple Pay

00:29:21.616 --> 00:29:23.186 A:middle
as a payment inside apps at all.

00:29:23.646 --> 00:29:26.106 A:middle
This session cannot
contain that awesomeness.

00:29:26.666 --> 00:29:30.726 A:middle
We have our own session
immediately following this one,

00:29:31.126 --> 00:29:34.446 A:middle
give by my colleagues Nick
and Rachel, and it's going

00:29:34.446 --> 00:29:35.576 A:middle
to be really, really amazing.

00:29:35.576 --> 00:29:37.796 A:middle
They will solve that
abandoned cart issue.

00:29:38.056 --> 00:29:41.806 A:middle
They're going to help integrate
Apple Pay into your apps.

00:29:42.966 --> 00:29:45.836 A:middle
Remember, please use
Wallet and use Apple Pay.

00:29:45.836 --> 00:29:47.306 A:middle
Go out there and redeem coupons.

00:29:47.936 --> 00:29:48.976 A:middle
Go out there and spend money!

00:29:49.566 --> 00:29:55.526 A:middle
I mentioned a lot of resources
during this talk and I want

00:29:55.526 --> 00:29:57.026 A:middle
to point a couple
of them out to you.

00:29:57.436 --> 00:30:00.676 A:middle
First, we have Passbook for
Developers specific site

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:57.436 --> 00:30:00.676 A:middle
First, we have Passbook for
Developers specific site

00:30:00.676 --> 00:30:02.296 A:middle
on our developer website.

00:30:02.776 --> 00:30:04.756 A:middle
We also have one specific
to Apple Pay as well.

00:30:04.756 --> 00:30:08.526 A:middle
And I mentioned a couple of
talks from previous WWDCs.

00:30:09.206 --> 00:30:10.546 A:middle
Here's one from 2012,

00:30:10.796 --> 00:30:14.266 A:middle
it's called "Introducing
Passbook Part 1 &amp; 2" that's

00:30:14.266 --> 00:30:16.176 A:middle
really going to go in
depth into designing passes

00:30:16.276 --> 00:30:17.486 A:middle
and updating passes as well.

00:30:17.856 --> 00:30:19.736 A:middle
And then "Integrating Passbook

00:30:19.736 --> 00:30:23.096 A:middle
Into Your Ecosystem"
which is WWDC 2013.

00:30:24.016 --> 00:30:26.006 A:middle
These are really great resources
for you guys to check out.

00:30:26.596 --> 00:30:28.366 A:middle
And of course we have
our developer forum

00:30:28.876 --> 00:30:30.806 A:middle
that you guys can
utilize as well.

00:30:32.016 --> 00:30:35.956 A:middle
And a really awesome evangelist
Paul can also help you guys

00:30:35.956 --> 00:30:37.576 A:middle
out here, here's
his email address.

00:30:38.746 --> 00:30:42.166 A:middle
So again, thank you for your
time, thank you for coming

00:30:42.166 --> 00:30:44.876 A:middle
and listening about
Wallet and Apple Pay.

00:30:45.236 --> 00:30:48.026 A:middle
I hope you go out there have
a really, really great week.

00:30:48.226 --> 00:30:48.726 A:middle
Thanks a lot.

00:30:48.936 --> 00:30:49.136 A:middle
(Applause)
