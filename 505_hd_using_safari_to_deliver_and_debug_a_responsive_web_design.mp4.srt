&gt;&gt; JONO WELLS: Good morning.

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:35.366 A:middle
Welcome to using Safari
to deliver and debug,

00:00:35.606 --> 00:00:37.476 A:middle
a responsive web design.

00:00:38.026 --> 00:00:39.376 A:middle
My name is Jono Wells.

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:45.536 A:middle
I am an engineer on the Safari
and WebKit team with Apple,

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.196 A:middle
and I'm really excited
to talk to you today.

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:52.276 A:middle
I have a great privilege
of being able to develop

00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.826 A:middle
for the Development
Tools that are a part

00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:56.646 A:middle
of the Safari web browser.

00:00:57.146 --> 00:01:01.076 A:middle
I feel I'm privileged
because I love the web,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:57.146 --> 00:01:01.076 A:middle
I feel I'm privileged
because I love the web,

00:01:01.076 --> 00:01:02.096 A:middle
as I'm sure you do.

00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:04.226 A:middle
I think Safari is
a great browser,

00:01:04.456 --> 00:01:06.806 A:middle
a really great platform.

00:01:07.816 --> 00:01:10.636 A:middle
It deserves world-class
Development Tools,

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:11.306 A:middle
wouldn't you agree?

00:01:11.786 --> 00:01:15.696 A:middle
Especially because we are
not just making content

00:01:15.796 --> 00:01:19.256 A:middle
in the web browser, we're making
content in our apps as well,

00:01:19.576 --> 00:01:21.726 A:middle
using web views and so
we want that content

00:01:21.846 --> 00:01:23.956 A:middle
to run great and look great.

00:01:25.316 --> 00:01:28.306 A:middle
So this morning, of course
we're going to be talking

00:01:28.306 --> 00:01:31.226 A:middle
about Web Inspector, a tool most

00:01:31.226 --> 00:01:32.946 A:middle
of you have probably
used before, hopefully.

00:01:32.946 --> 00:01:34.056 A:middle
We're also going to be talking

00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:37.906 A:middle
about a brand-new tool called
Responsive Design Mode.

00:01:38.996 --> 00:01:43.776 A:middle
With these two tools together
we're going to very rapidly

00:01:44.796 --> 00:01:49.366 A:middle
and very smartly improve
the quality of our site

00:01:49.606 --> 00:01:52.986 A:middle
and get a good solid
responsive design as a result.

00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:55.756 A:middle
Let's begin by talking
about Web Inspector.

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:58.406 A:middle
This is Web Inspector,
of course.

00:01:58.826 --> 00:02:01.086 A:middle
This is the one you've been
working with for the last year.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:58.826 --> 00:02:01.086 A:middle
This is the one you've been
working with for the last year.

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:04.576 A:middle
We've come up with a lot
of great new features.

00:02:04.906 --> 00:02:06.976 A:middle
We've also gotten some
great feedback from you

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:09.645 A:middle
over the last year
about the interface.

00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:13.096 A:middle
We took a lot of that to
heart and we changed things

00:02:13.096 --> 00:02:15.266 A:middle
around a little bit so
this is the Web Inspector

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:17.656 A:middle
that we're releasing with
this release of Safari.

00:02:18.156 --> 00:02:19.726 A:middle
Here it is.

00:02:20.516 --> 00:02:23.656 A:middle
[Applause]

00:02:24.156 --> 00:02:25.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JONO WELLS: I suspect
some of you may be applauding

00:02:25.526 --> 00:02:27.436 A:middle
because there is a
dedicated elements tab

00:02:27.436 --> 00:02:28.256 A:middle
as you see up there.

00:02:28.506 --> 00:02:33.306 A:middle
We have a tab based
interface, all the tools

00:02:33.306 --> 00:02:36.476 A:middle
that you would expect in Web
Inspector are here; resources,

00:02:36.776 --> 00:02:40.976 A:middle
timeline, the debugger, the
storage tab and a console tab.

00:02:40.976 --> 00:02:43.826 A:middle
But these are tabs so of
course you can get rid of ones

00:02:43.826 --> 00:02:45.606 A:middle
that you want to
get out of your way

00:02:45.606 --> 00:02:46.586 A:middle
if there are tools
you don't work

00:02:46.586 --> 00:02:48.706 A:middle
with as often you can just
move them out of the way,

00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:51.086 A:middle
you can reorganize the ones
that are already there,

00:02:51.116 --> 00:02:54.296 A:middle
if you want to bring one back,
you just hit the plus button

00:02:54.296 --> 00:02:57.116 A:middle
on the right-hand side and open
up whichever one you want to.

00:02:57.626 --> 00:03:00.176 A:middle
We give you the ability
to customize Web Inspector

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:57.626 --> 00:03:00.176 A:middle
We give you the ability
to customize Web Inspector

00:03:00.176 --> 00:03:03.916 A:middle
to look more like what you
want, to work the way you do.

00:03:04.316 --> 00:03:06.716 A:middle
We've made improvements
to the interface there.

00:03:07.406 --> 00:03:10.046 A:middle
Now let's talk about
what new things we can do

00:03:10.046 --> 00:03:13.056 A:middle
with Web Inspector and
how it can help us.

00:03:13.056 --> 00:03:16.236 A:middle
The first one is, it can
help us get great performance

00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:17.466 A:middle
out of our content.

00:03:17.466 --> 00:03:18.676 A:middle
It helps you get
great performance.

00:03:19.146 --> 00:03:21.786 A:middle
Now it almost dragoons you
to get great performance

00:03:21.786 --> 00:03:22.796 A:middle
and we'll talk about how.

00:03:23.916 --> 00:03:26.166 A:middle
What do I mean when I
say great performance?

00:03:27.076 --> 00:03:29.566 A:middle
The gold standard as I'm
sure most of you know,

00:03:29.756 --> 00:03:33.346 A:middle
is 60 frames per second, because
our screens are refreshing

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.116 A:middle
at 60 Hertz, 60 times a second.

00:03:35.926 --> 00:03:39.836 A:middle
This means that if we are trying
to render a smooth animation,

00:03:40.276 --> 00:03:42.926 A:middle
right, for any given
rendering frame, right,

00:03:42.926 --> 00:03:46.306 A:middle
in a turn of the event loop
we need to make sure all

00:03:46.306 --> 00:03:48.596 A:middle
of our scripts, our
timers, and our layout

00:03:48.596 --> 00:03:52.686 A:middle
and rendering can happen
within 16.67 milliseconds.

00:03:53.306 --> 00:03:57.926 A:middle
If we blow this budget, then
our animation will stutter

00:03:57.926 --> 00:03:59.486 A:middle
and that's not something
that we want.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:05.396 A:middle
How can we get better
information

00:04:05.396 --> 00:04:08.806 A:middle
to help us debug the
performance of our content?

00:04:09.536 --> 00:04:10.376 A:middle
We have this idea.

00:04:11.566 --> 00:04:13.576 A:middle
What if you could just
look at the content

00:04:13.576 --> 00:04:15.096 A:middle
and every time a paint occurs,

00:04:15.836 --> 00:04:19.856 A:middle
we just flash a region
of the screen?

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:22.005 A:middle
We added something
called Paint Flashing.

00:04:22.146 --> 00:04:24.626 A:middle
When you're in the elements tab,
in the upper right-hand corner,

00:04:24.666 --> 00:04:26.266 A:middle
you will see this paintbrush.

00:04:27.226 --> 00:04:28.726 A:middle
Click that, turn that on.

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:32.936 A:middle
When that is lit up blue, every
single time a paint occurs

00:04:32.936 --> 00:04:37.156 A:middle
on your page it will light up
red with a translucent red box.

00:04:37.956 --> 00:04:39.736 A:middle
You're going to want to
try this on your content.

00:04:39.736 --> 00:04:41.176 A:middle
It going to light up
like a Christmas tree.

00:04:41.176 --> 00:04:41.896 A:middle
It is amazing!

00:04:41.896 --> 00:04:44.616 A:middle
It's going to look like a game
of Simon if you ever played

00:04:44.616 --> 00:04:48.746 A:middle
that with a kid -- as a kid.

00:04:48.866 --> 00:04:50.446 A:middle
That's going to give you a sense

00:04:50.676 --> 00:04:52.186 A:middle
that perhaps you're
painting too often,

00:04:52.406 --> 00:04:53.946 A:middle
there's too much
happening on your page.

00:04:54.996 --> 00:04:56.886 A:middle
But what about what's
happening behind the scenes?

00:04:57.876 --> 00:04:59.476 A:middle
To help you get more
information there

00:04:59.706 --> 00:05:02.346 A:middle
and get you towards 60 frames
per second performance,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.706 --> 00:05:02.346 A:middle
and get you towards 60 frames
per second performance,

00:05:02.706 --> 00:05:04.846 A:middle
we've added a great new tool
called the Rendering Frames

00:05:04.926 --> 00:05:05.466 A:middle
Time Line.

00:05:06.016 --> 00:05:10.666 A:middle
If you go to the time
lines tab you can get to it

00:05:10.666 --> 00:05:12.836 A:middle
by clicking right here
on Rendering Frames

00:05:13.016 --> 00:05:14.416 A:middle
and this is the interface
you will see.

00:05:14.746 --> 00:05:17.736 A:middle
When -- so you can
record, use your site

00:05:17.736 --> 00:05:19.506 A:middle
and we will start
drawing these bars.

00:05:19.506 --> 00:05:22.276 A:middle
Each one of these bars
represents a rendering frame.

00:05:22.596 --> 00:05:25.086 A:middle
They're segmented into
different colors based

00:05:25.086 --> 00:05:26.446 A:middle
on what is happening
in each frame.

00:05:26.846 --> 00:05:30.496 A:middle
Purple for scripts, event
timers and such, red for layout

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:34.116 A:middle
and rendering and gray for
behind the scenes engine work

00:05:34.356 --> 00:05:35.506 A:middle
that the engine is doing.

00:05:36.126 --> 00:05:39.096 A:middle
The goal is to keep each

00:05:39.096 --> 00:05:42.566 A:middle
of these bars underneath
the middle line right here,

00:05:43.516 --> 00:05:44.976 A:middle
the 60 frames per second line.

00:05:45.306 --> 00:05:47.376 A:middle
If your bars tend
to go above that,

00:05:47.706 --> 00:05:50.526 A:middle
it means you're possibly
not going

00:05:50.526 --> 00:05:52.206 A:middle
to be getting 60 frames
per second performance

00:05:52.446 --> 00:05:54.556 A:middle
and we want to work on that.

00:05:55.006 --> 00:05:57.516 A:middle
You can select a region of
the bars just like you can

00:05:57.516 --> 00:06:00.286 A:middle
on the other timeline, and
we're going to show you a lot

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:57.516 --> 00:06:00.286 A:middle
on the other timeline, and
we're going to show you a lot

00:06:00.286 --> 00:06:01.376 A:middle
of good information about that.

00:06:01.376 --> 00:06:03.636 A:middle
First of all, we're going to
show you this graph right here,

00:06:03.636 --> 00:06:06.266 A:middle
this is an aggregate of
the different activity

00:06:06.266 --> 00:06:07.796 A:middle
that is happening in
that particular region.

00:06:07.796 --> 00:06:11.866 A:middle
We're going to give you a
breakdown of each frame.

00:06:12.096 --> 00:06:13.756 A:middle
You can open up every
single rendering frame

00:06:13.756 --> 00:06:15.126 A:middle
and see exactly what's
happening.

00:06:15.726 --> 00:06:18.916 A:middle
For things like event
timers and rendering,

00:06:19.096 --> 00:06:22.366 A:middle
style and validation inside of
your code we have the ability,

00:06:22.366 --> 00:06:24.906 A:middle
of course, to click to the
relevant line of source codes

00:06:24.906 --> 00:06:26.116 A:middle
so you can see what's going on.

00:06:26.936 --> 00:06:29.636 A:middle
We also show you this table
of timing information.

00:06:30.396 --> 00:06:32.366 A:middle
One of my favorite things to
do, I have been using this

00:06:32.366 --> 00:06:35.456 A:middle
for a bit, what's been really
helpful for me is to sort

00:06:35.456 --> 00:06:38.376 A:middle
by total time for reach
Rendering Frame and then I open

00:06:38.376 --> 00:06:40.836 A:middle
up the one on the top
because it is most likely

00:06:41.116 --> 00:06:44.126 A:middle
that the most offensive
frames are at the top

00:06:44.126 --> 00:06:46.326 A:middle
and then I can see what is
holding back my performance.

00:06:47.186 --> 00:06:52.026 A:middle
This tool is going to tell you a
great story about your content.

00:06:52.176 --> 00:06:55.006 A:middle
Even if you think you're
performing well, you're going

00:06:55.006 --> 00:06:57.456 A:middle
to want to hookup
to this and see

00:06:57.456 --> 00:07:00.196 A:middle
if you can get additional
performance out of your site.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:57.456 --> 00:07:00.196 A:middle
if you can get additional
performance out of your site.

00:07:00.866 --> 00:07:03.266 A:middle
It tells you a great
story, it allows you to do

00:07:03.436 --> 00:07:05.776 A:middle
without thinking, that's really
what we want our development

00:07:05.776 --> 00:07:06.626 A:middle
tools to do.

00:07:06.966 --> 00:07:09.256 A:middle
Just to put the information out
in front of you and say here,

00:07:09.706 --> 00:07:14.686 A:middle
here it is, you don't have
to work too hard to get it.

00:07:14.946 --> 00:07:17.506 A:middle
One of the things that we've
been noticing is that you have

00:07:17.506 --> 00:07:19.086 A:middle
to jump around between
different tools

00:07:19.086 --> 00:07:20.326 A:middle
within Web Inspector a lot.

00:07:21.646 --> 00:07:24.186 A:middle
We thought it'd be great if you
could focus on a particular one.

00:07:24.906 --> 00:07:27.186 A:middle
More often if you can
just stay in one tool

00:07:27.646 --> 00:07:28.686 A:middle
that might save you time.

00:07:29.546 --> 00:07:31.046 A:middle
We've done this in a few ways.

00:07:31.196 --> 00:07:34.376 A:middle
One of the ways is for errors

00:07:34.376 --> 00:07:37.206 A:middle
and warnings we don't just
show those in the console now,

00:07:37.206 --> 00:07:38.626 A:middle
we show them in a
few other places

00:07:38.846 --> 00:07:40.316 A:middle
so that you can spot
them more quickly.

00:07:40.876 --> 00:07:42.776 A:middle
In the debugger side-bar
for instance on the left,

00:07:43.676 --> 00:07:46.236 A:middle
any resource that has an error
warning we'll just show them

00:07:46.236 --> 00:07:50.256 A:middle
underneath, they'll appear so
you can just jump right to them.

00:07:50.466 --> 00:07:54.556 A:middle
In all of the JavaScript code in
your site, we'll show the errors

00:07:54.556 --> 00:07:57.756 A:middle
and warnings in line so
you'll see those messages.

00:07:57.786 --> 00:07:59.756 A:middle
So if you're just browsing,
everything will just show up.

00:07:59.756 --> 00:08:00.546 A:middle
It's a lot nicer.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:59.756 --> 00:08:00.546 A:middle
It's a lot nicer.

00:08:01.046 --> 00:08:04.026 A:middle
We have also improved the
way they look in the console

00:08:04.356 --> 00:08:06.146 A:middle
so errors and warnings,
they're highlighted,

00:08:06.146 --> 00:08:08.426 A:middle
the colors are easily
distinguishable.

00:08:09.506 --> 00:08:10.456 A:middle
They just look better too,

00:08:10.456 --> 00:08:12.016 A:middle
we've made the fonts
better, it's great.

00:08:12.486 --> 00:08:19.116 A:middle
We have this other idea,
and again we want to Do

00:08:19.116 --> 00:08:20.066 A:middle
Without Thinking, we want

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:21.606 A:middle
to put important
information in front of you.

00:08:21.886 --> 00:08:24.876 A:middle
JavaScript of course, is a
dynamically typed language.

00:08:25.406 --> 00:08:27.976 A:middle
That means that the engine
itself assigns the types

00:08:27.976 --> 00:08:29.176 A:middle
for you, you don't have to.

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:31.796 A:middle
This is what's happening
behind the scenes in this case.

00:08:32.096 --> 00:08:34.926 A:middle
Right. We have a string, we have
an integer, we have an object.

00:08:36.426 --> 00:08:39.736 A:middle
If you're working
with some code,

00:08:39.736 --> 00:08:41.265 A:middle
here's a function
that's designed

00:08:41.265 --> 00:08:42.416 A:middle
to add two numbers together,

00:08:42.416 --> 00:08:44.836 A:middle
and this is a mistake
that might happen.

00:08:45.046 --> 00:08:48.966 A:middle
We're accidentally passing in
a string, and so that is going

00:08:48.966 --> 00:08:50.626 A:middle
to lead to some unexpected
results we're going

00:08:50.626 --> 00:08:51.396 A:middle
to call a dysfunction.

00:08:52.166 --> 00:08:55.516 A:middle
This is something that you can
discover by trying to debug,

00:08:55.516 --> 00:08:56.846 A:middle
and play around with
your code, might be a,

00:08:57.096 --> 00:08:58.386 A:middle
in a more complicated case,

00:08:58.386 --> 00:08:59.676 A:middle
might be hard to
find this error.

00:08:59.866 --> 00:09:01.836 A:middle
But, what if you could
see something like this

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:59.866 --> 00:09:01.836 A:middle
But, what if you could
see something like this

00:09:02.086 --> 00:09:05.356 A:middle
where we just show you
as your code is running,

00:09:05.566 --> 00:09:07.396 A:middle
we show you the types
that have been assigned

00:09:07.966 --> 00:09:11.816 A:middle
to all the different variables,
passed in as parameters,

00:09:12.116 --> 00:09:13.456 A:middle
or return from functions.

00:09:14.956 --> 00:09:17.186 A:middle
We created just such a thing.

00:09:17.706 --> 00:09:19.656 A:middle
We call this the
Type Profiling Tool.

00:09:19.656 --> 00:09:21.266 A:middle
If you look in the
upper right-hand corner

00:09:21.346 --> 00:09:21.786 A:middle
when you're looking

00:09:21.786 --> 00:09:25.686 A:middle
at any JavaScript source you'll
see this T button right here.

00:09:25.686 --> 00:09:28.106 A:middle
If you click that, from
that point forward,

00:09:28.106 --> 00:09:30.346 A:middle
when your code runs, your code
is going to go from looking

00:09:30.546 --> 00:09:33.796 A:middle
like this to looking like this.

00:09:34.516 --> 00:09:38.866 A:middle
[Applause]

00:09:39.366 --> 00:09:40.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JONO WELLS: I love this tool!

00:09:40.536 --> 00:09:41.276 A:middle
It's so cool!

00:09:41.276 --> 00:09:43.726 A:middle
I've been using it a lot
working on Web Inspector.

00:09:44.716 --> 00:09:48.226 A:middle
We're going to show you as
best as we can type information

00:09:48.416 --> 00:09:51.366 A:middle
as your variables
are assigned values.

00:09:51.526 --> 00:09:54.146 A:middle
You'll also notice that some
of the code is grayed out.

00:09:54.396 --> 00:09:56.366 A:middle
Since we're tracking what
code has been covered,

00:09:56.976 --> 00:09:58.096 A:middle
any code that hasn't
been reached

00:09:58.096 --> 00:09:59.256 A:middle
yet will be grayed out for you.

00:09:59.486 --> 00:10:01.866 A:middle
So this also serves as a
great code coverage tool.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.486 --> 00:10:01.866 A:middle
So this also serves as a
great code coverage tool.

00:10:02.346 --> 00:10:04.826 A:middle
Right. It going to
allow you to see

00:10:04.826 --> 00:10:06.136 A:middle
if a function isn't being run

00:10:06.416 --> 00:10:10.226 A:middle
or if an else condition isn't
being reached, things like that.

00:10:11.496 --> 00:10:13.416 A:middle
You'll also notice that we
show you the return value

00:10:13.416 --> 00:10:14.126 A:middle
from a function.

00:10:14.346 --> 00:10:16.296 A:middle
In this case I have a function
that's returning something

00:10:16.296 --> 00:10:19.296 A:middle
called a DeveloperPerson,
it's a class I wrote.

00:10:19.296 --> 00:10:21.026 A:middle
You'll also notice that
we're showing you the name

00:10:21.026 --> 00:10:21.836 A:middle
of that object.

00:10:22.266 --> 00:10:25.356 A:middle
If you have constructer
functions, right, like this one,

00:10:25.356 --> 00:10:27.826 A:middle
if you're using this classical
model using prototypes

00:10:28.266 --> 00:10:32.766 A:middle
and you construct an object that
way, we will show you the name

00:10:32.766 --> 00:10:33.866 A:middle
of the constructer function.

00:10:34.076 --> 00:10:35.206 A:middle
We'll do the same
thing of course,

00:10:35.206 --> 00:10:38.366 A:middle
if you're using ES6
classes which just landed

00:10:38.626 --> 00:10:43.466 A:middle
in this release, we'll show
you the name of the class.

00:10:43.896 --> 00:10:47.876 A:middle
Obviously parameters can
get past multiple values

00:10:47.876 --> 00:10:49.546 A:middle
over the lifetime
of your application.

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:51.906 A:middle
What happens if you
have multiple types?

00:10:52.606 --> 00:10:54.266 A:middle
For objects here is
how we handle it.

00:10:54.786 --> 00:10:57.786 A:middle
Let's say I have a
function called register.

00:10:58.636 --> 00:11:01.416 A:middle
Right. So we're going
to register somebody

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:58.636 --> 00:11:01.416 A:middle
Right. So we're going
to register somebody

00:11:01.416 --> 00:11:03.106 A:middle
for a conference or
something like that.

00:11:03.816 --> 00:11:06.946 A:middle
Say I call it once, and I
pass in a new DeveloperPerson.

00:11:07.606 --> 00:11:09.906 A:middle
Well, we're just going to show
you that it's a DeveloperPerson.

00:11:09.906 --> 00:11:11.676 A:middle
If we pass in another object,

00:11:11.676 --> 00:11:13.206 A:middle
say a ManagerPerson,
we'll show you that.

00:11:13.436 --> 00:11:15.596 A:middle
Let's say we pass in
both a DeveloperPerson

00:11:15.596 --> 00:11:17.656 A:middle
and a ManagerPerson, then

00:11:17.656 --> 00:11:20.336 A:middle
since they both have a
common ancestor, person,

00:11:20.506 --> 00:11:21.636 A:middle
that's what we're
going to show you.

00:11:22.686 --> 00:11:24.096 A:middle
If we pass in something
else that isn't

00:11:24.096 --> 00:11:27.276 A:middle
in this inheritance chain at
all like an extraterrestrial

00:11:27.276 --> 00:11:30.186 A:middle
for instance, we'll
just show you object,

00:11:30.186 --> 00:11:35.146 A:middle
because of course everything
derives from object, right?

00:11:35.886 --> 00:11:37.936 A:middle
Now here are all the different
types that we might show you.

00:11:38.396 --> 00:11:43.186 A:middle
If there are multiple types,
a string, and a number

00:11:43.186 --> 00:11:45.236 A:middle
that get assigned to a value,
this is what you're going to see

00:11:45.236 --> 00:11:48.116 A:middle
in your code, it's just
going to show you many.

00:11:48.116 --> 00:11:51.216 A:middle
There is an exception to this,
say you have a simple type

00:11:51.216 --> 00:11:54.636 A:middle
like a double and it's a
double sometimes and it's null

00:11:54.636 --> 00:11:57.386 A:middle
or undefined sometimes, we'll
just add a question mark

00:11:57.386 --> 00:11:59.226 A:middle
to the top, that means
it's double sometimes

00:11:59.546 --> 00:12:01.486 A:middle
or sometimes it's a null value.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.546 --> 00:12:01.486 A:middle
or sometimes it's a null value.

00:12:02.006 --> 00:12:05.066 A:middle
This is such a nice feature,

00:12:05.066 --> 00:12:06.316 A:middle
I just want to show
you a few more shots.

00:12:06.516 --> 00:12:08.016 A:middle
This is code from
the Web Inspector.

00:12:08.386 --> 00:12:09.126 A:middle
It's just really nice.

00:12:09.126 --> 00:12:12.206 A:middle
It gives you a bird's eye
view of what's happening

00:12:12.206 --> 00:12:13.116 A:middle
with your application.

00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:16.846 A:middle
You can quickly spot behavior
that isn't interesting to you.

00:12:17.006 --> 00:12:18.316 A:middle
Right. Here is an
object assignment.

00:12:18.506 --> 00:12:21.756 A:middle
Again, you can see the coverage,

00:12:21.756 --> 00:12:23.676 A:middle
you can see areas
that are grayed out.

00:12:24.836 --> 00:12:27.346 A:middle
This has been incredibly
useful in my development

00:12:27.346 --> 00:12:28.486 A:middle
with Web Inspector,
I think you're going

00:12:28.486 --> 00:12:29.676 A:middle
to find it just as
useful as well.

00:12:29.746 --> 00:12:31.066 A:middle
This is the type profiling tool.

00:12:32.516 --> 00:12:38.076 A:middle
[Applause]

00:12:38.576 --> 00:12:39.266 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JONO WELLS: All right.

00:12:39.796 --> 00:12:43.346 A:middle
We have also made
improvements to the console.

00:12:44.356 --> 00:12:46.206 A:middle
In a similar way
we want to be able

00:12:46.206 --> 00:12:48.616 A:middle
to put really useful
information in front of you

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:50.686 A:middle
without you having
to work too hard.

00:12:52.076 --> 00:12:54.676 A:middle
Here are some objects that we
have launched in the console.

00:12:54.876 --> 00:12:56.326 A:middle
And you're going to
notice a few things.

00:12:56.846 --> 00:12:58.026 A:middle
The first one is that
we're creating --

00:12:58.336 --> 00:12:59.586 A:middle
we give you object preview,

00:12:59.586 --> 00:13:01.736 A:middle
so you have really good
looking object previews

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.586 --> 00:13:01.736 A:middle
so you have really good
looking object previews

00:13:02.086 --> 00:13:06.226 A:middle
so you might spot information
inside your object much

00:13:06.226 --> 00:13:06.826 A:middle
more quickly.

00:13:07.666 --> 00:13:08.866 A:middle
You're also going to
notice something else,

00:13:08.866 --> 00:13:10.756 A:middle
every time something is
output to the console,

00:13:11.226 --> 00:13:13.916 A:middle
we're going to store it
in a variable for you.

00:13:14.416 --> 00:13:16.756 A:middle
This starts at dollar sign
1 and then dollar sign 2,

00:13:17.036 --> 00:13:18.826 A:middle
then dollar sign 3,
on and on and on.

00:13:19.706 --> 00:13:23.376 A:middle
You can reference
them again just

00:13:23.376 --> 00:13:25.936 A:middle
by putting them in the console.

00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:26.946 A:middle
This is great.

00:13:27.116 --> 00:13:29.786 A:middle
The feedback that we got
from you, because these used

00:13:29.786 --> 00:13:33.386 A:middle
to represent recently selected
elements in the elements panel

00:13:33.796 --> 00:13:36.486 A:middle
and the feedback was that really
everyone was only using one

00:13:36.486 --> 00:13:38.996 A:middle
of those, which is dollar
sign 0, so don't worry,

00:13:38.996 --> 00:13:42.136 A:middle
that's still the currently
selected element, still there,

00:13:42.396 --> 00:13:44.336 A:middle
it'll still work as you
expect it to, but starting

00:13:44.336 --> 00:13:47.406 A:middle
with dollar sign one, those'll
be recently logged variables.

00:13:47.986 --> 00:13:51.126 A:middle
That can be really useful,
right, if you're paused

00:13:51.126 --> 00:13:54.176 A:middle
in the debugger and there's a
value in the scope that you want

00:13:54.176 --> 00:13:57.066 A:middle
to remember, you no longer have
to go into your source code

00:13:57.456 --> 00:14:00.116 A:middle
and create a variable just
for debugging purposes

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:57.456 --> 00:14:00.116 A:middle
and create a variable just
for debugging purposes

00:14:00.116 --> 00:14:01.706 A:middle
and then save it,
and then run the app,

00:14:01.706 --> 00:14:03.046 A:middle
then delete it later, or forget.

00:14:03.046 --> 00:14:04.336 A:middle
You don't have to do
any of that anymore,

00:14:04.596 --> 00:14:05.716 A:middle
we'll take care of that for you.

00:14:07.056 --> 00:14:09.346 A:middle
What about when you open
up one of the objects.

00:14:09.836 --> 00:14:12.106 A:middle
You're going to see this.

00:14:12.266 --> 00:14:13.196 A:middle
It's a lot nicer.

00:14:13.536 --> 00:14:15.616 A:middle
First of all, we've
just improved the look

00:14:15.786 --> 00:14:18.386 A:middle
and used colors to
distinguish the different types

00:14:18.386 --> 00:14:21.476 A:middle
of information that can
be inside of an object.

00:14:21.476 --> 00:14:24.196 A:middle
Everyone of the objects
inside has its own preview.

00:14:24.356 --> 00:14:26.276 A:middle
You'll notice that this
is an array, siblings,

00:14:26.656 --> 00:14:28.406 A:middle
this one has a special
type of preview,

00:14:28.406 --> 00:14:32.206 A:middle
we've created special previews
for certain things, Maps, sets,

00:14:32.206 --> 00:14:35.246 A:middle
weak sets, weak maps, promises.

00:14:36.546 --> 00:14:39.346 A:middle
Right. We show you the types
of the objects inside the array

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:41.316 A:middle
and the size of the
array on the right.

00:14:41.836 --> 00:14:44.736 A:middle
When you open it, we show you
the index of each object inside.

00:14:44.736 --> 00:14:46.346 A:middle
Of course, each of
those have a preview.

00:14:46.966 --> 00:14:47.786 A:middle
I want you to notice here

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:49.706 A:middle
that we also have
made it a lot easier

00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:52.716 A:middle
to inspect the prototype
chain so I can then open

00:14:52.716 --> 00:14:55.536 A:middle
up the prototype for developer
person and for person,

00:14:55.536 --> 00:14:57.036 A:middle
and I might see something
like this.

00:14:58.376 --> 00:14:59.636 A:middle
I love this very much.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:00.616 --> 00:15:03.906 A:middle
This gives me the ability to
essentially get an API view

00:15:03.996 --> 00:15:06.466 A:middle
of my object in the classes
that constructed this object.

00:15:07.396 --> 00:15:09.656 A:middle
Look at this.

00:15:09.656 --> 00:15:11.676 A:middle
I can quickly spot and see okay,

00:15:12.066 --> 00:15:14.706 A:middle
I have a function called
change name that takes

00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:15.836 A:middle
in a first name and last name.

00:15:16.476 --> 00:15:20.056 A:middle
I have a custom setter
called firstName.

00:15:20.376 --> 00:15:24.486 A:middle
I have a custom getter
called fullName.

00:15:25.066 --> 00:15:27.506 A:middle
I can tell that because
there's an eyeball next to it.

00:15:27.506 --> 00:15:28.706 A:middle
I can click on that eyeball

00:15:28.706 --> 00:15:31.596 A:middle
and it'll actually
run the custom getter.

00:15:32.636 --> 00:15:36.566 A:middle
This is almost better than the
documentation in some cases.

00:15:36.996 --> 00:15:39.716 A:middle
It is even great for
native API exploration,

00:15:39.716 --> 00:15:40.946 A:middle
and some of you are
probably thinking,

00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:44.326 A:middle
I can't remember how local
storage works, no problem,

00:15:44.506 --> 00:15:45.736 A:middle
just put it in the console.

00:15:45.826 --> 00:15:46.986 A:middle
I can see all of the functions,

00:15:47.176 --> 00:15:48.936 A:middle
it looks a lot better,
it's really nice.

00:15:49.336 --> 00:15:50.856 A:middle
Really great for
object exploration,

00:15:50.856 --> 00:15:53.836 A:middle
if you're exploring
third-party APIs, it's great.

00:15:53.996 --> 00:15:55.646 A:middle
It's not just in
the console, either.

00:15:55.846 --> 00:15:58.416 A:middle
Anywhere we show object views,
for instance, if you're paused

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:01.886 A:middle
in the debugger and you have the
view of the variables in scope

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:01.886 A:middle
in the debugger and you have the
view of the variables in scope

00:16:01.886 --> 00:16:03.976 A:middle
on the right, or when
you're mousing over,

00:16:04.376 --> 00:16:07.896 A:middle
a variable in the source
view, let me show you that -

00:16:08.146 --> 00:16:11.096 A:middle
same beautiful object views
in all of those places.

00:16:12.076 --> 00:16:15.336 A:middle
Nicely organized for the type
of information that is in there,

00:16:15.746 --> 00:16:18.836 A:middle
you're going to spot
information more quickly

00:16:19.026 --> 00:16:21.016 A:middle
and that is really the
goal of all of this.

00:16:21.056 --> 00:16:26.406 A:middle
I now would like to invite my
friend and colleague Andy Estes

00:16:26.406 --> 00:16:29.136 A:middle
to come up to the stage and
he's been working on a site

00:16:29.526 --> 00:16:31.596 A:middle
that he's excited to
show you and maybe some

00:16:31.596 --> 00:16:32.756 A:middle
of these tools will
help him out.

00:16:32.756 --> 00:16:32.976 A:middle
Andy.

00:16:33.516 --> 00:16:37.546 A:middle
[Applause]

00:16:38.046 --> 00:16:40.606 A:middle
&gt;&gt; ANDY ESTES: Thank you, Jono
and thank you to all of you

00:16:40.606 --> 00:16:41.576 A:middle
for being here this morning.

00:16:41.616 --> 00:16:42.836 A:middle
I'm really excited to be here

00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:44.896 A:middle
and show you these new
tools in Web Inspector.

00:16:45.716 --> 00:16:48.676 A:middle
First, a bit of a confession, I
was up late last night working

00:16:48.676 --> 00:16:51.116 A:middle
on this site, I wanted
it to look good.

00:16:51.516 --> 00:16:55.506 A:middle
It's supposed to display a
bunch of photography I've taken

00:16:55.816 --> 00:16:58.026 A:middle
and I think I've introduced
a bug and if you don't mind,

00:16:58.026 --> 00:17:00.606 A:middle
I just want to see if I can
figure out this bug I introduced

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:58.026 --> 00:17:00.606 A:middle
I just want to see if I can
figure out this bug I introduced

00:17:00.606 --> 00:17:02.596 A:middle
and fix it real quick
so I'm just going

00:17:02.596 --> 00:17:03.816 A:middle
to go into Web Inspector.

00:17:03.816 --> 00:17:05.736 A:middle
By the way, if you never
opened the inspector before,

00:17:05.935 --> 00:17:07.076 A:middle
you do it from the develop menu

00:17:07.076 --> 00:17:08.906 A:middle
and you don't have a
develop menu in your Safari,

00:17:08.906 --> 00:17:10.976 A:middle
it's really easy to
enable, you simply go

00:17:10.976 --> 00:17:12.046 A:middle
to Safari's preferences,

00:17:12.195 --> 00:17:14.656 A:middle
and in the advanced tab
you'll see the option,

00:17:14.656 --> 00:17:17.396 A:middle
show development menu in mini
bar, I already have that checked

00:17:17.496 --> 00:17:18.816 A:middle
so I'll just go right in there.

00:17:18.816 --> 00:17:21.455 A:middle
I'm going to say Develop,
show Web Inspector.

00:17:22.266 --> 00:17:25.185 A:middle
It will open this up along the
bottom and right away I see

00:17:25.185 --> 00:17:27.346 A:middle
that I have an error
here in the console.

00:17:27.346 --> 00:17:30.356 A:middle
I can click it, it looks like
undefined is not an object,

00:17:30.736 --> 00:17:33.576 A:middle
I can jump to the debugger,
I even have the error here

00:17:33.576 --> 00:17:35.046 A:middle
in the side-bar, I can click it,

00:17:35.046 --> 00:17:37.506 A:middle
it'll take me right
to the line of code.

00:17:37.936 --> 00:17:39.136 A:middle
Let's take a look at this.

00:17:39.226 --> 00:17:42.216 A:middle
Somewhere in this line of code
I'm seeing an undefined value

00:17:42.216 --> 00:17:43.116 A:middle
where I don't expect it.

00:17:43.376 --> 00:17:45.336 A:middle
Now typically what I would do
is I would set a break point

00:17:45.336 --> 00:17:48.406 A:middle
and maybe spend some time
debugging but I don't have time

00:17:48.406 --> 00:17:50.086 A:middle
for that, instead I
think I'm just going

00:17:50.086 --> 00:17:51.966 A:middle
to enable the type
profiling to see if maybe

00:17:51.966 --> 00:17:54.526 A:middle
that can tell me
where my error is.

00:17:54.526 --> 00:17:57.356 A:middle
I'm going to click this T
to enable type profiling

00:17:57.356 --> 00:17:58.516 A:middle
and I'm going to
reload the site.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:08.816 --> 00:18:10.306 A:middle
Great, so there's my error.

00:18:11.196 --> 00:18:12.656 A:middle
And now my source
code is annotated

00:18:12.656 --> 00:18:13.666 A:middle
with these helpful pills

00:18:13.666 --> 00:18:15.616 A:middle
that tell me the types
of all my variables.

00:18:15.616 --> 00:18:17.406 A:middle
Let's just see if we can
quickly work this out.

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:21.416 A:middle
I have galleries,
which is an array.

00:18:22.366 --> 00:18:24.486 A:middle
I have current gallery
which is an imager.

00:18:24.566 --> 00:18:27.836 A:middle
The result of that
shouldn't be undefined

00:18:27.836 --> 00:18:30.516 A:middle
but I initialized
galleries up here,

00:18:30.516 --> 00:18:32.486 A:middle
and one of the things I'm
noticing is that the body

00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:33.786 A:middle
of my four loop is grayed out,

00:18:33.786 --> 00:18:36.376 A:middle
that means that code hasn't
been covered, and it looks

00:18:36.376 --> 00:18:39.256 A:middle
like that's because gallery
data itself is undefined.

00:18:39.586 --> 00:18:40.886 A:middle
That's somewhat unexpected,

00:18:40.886 --> 00:18:43.326 A:middle
I should be passing a
valid gallery data in here.

00:18:43.906 --> 00:18:47.776 A:middle
Gallery data itself comes from
this variable, this.options,

00:18:48.236 --> 00:18:49.986 A:middle
let's take a look
at where I set that.

00:18:50.116 --> 00:18:51.486 A:middle
I do that up in my constructer

00:18:51.486 --> 00:18:53.106 A:middle
for navigation galleries
controller.

00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:55.846 A:middle
And it does look like I'm
passing a valid object

00:18:55.846 --> 00:18:58.466 A:middle
to the constructer, I see
the object pill right there.

00:18:58.466 --> 00:19:02.296 A:middle
I'm not passing a null or
some other kind of type.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.466 --> 00:19:02.296 A:middle
I'm not passing a null or
some other kind of type.

00:19:02.486 --> 00:19:05.366 A:middle
Let's find where I construct
navigation galleries controller

00:19:05.366 --> 00:19:07.416 A:middle
and see if that tells
me what my mistake is.

00:19:07.866 --> 00:19:10.626 A:middle
I'm going to just copy this.

00:19:10.756 --> 00:19:13.506 A:middle
I'm going to use Web Inspectors'
global search and I can get

00:19:13.506 --> 00:19:15.796 A:middle
to that by command-shift-F
and it will search all

00:19:15.796 --> 00:19:17.416 A:middle
of the resources in the site.

00:19:17.916 --> 00:19:20.436 A:middle
And I have exactly one place

00:19:20.436 --> 00:19:22.766 A:middle
where I have a navigation
gallery controller,

00:19:23.146 --> 00:19:25.586 A:middle
it's right here and I
immediately spot my mistake.

00:19:25.586 --> 00:19:28.176 A:middle
I was expecting to pass an
object that had gallery data

00:19:28.176 --> 00:19:30.796 A:middle
as a property, instead I'm just
passing gallery data directly.

00:19:30.796 --> 00:19:31.776 A:middle
Let's fix that real quick.

00:19:32.306 --> 00:19:35.426 A:middle
I can use the convenient
ES6 shorthand syntax

00:19:35.426 --> 00:19:36.986 A:middle
for declaring a new
object that's going

00:19:36.986 --> 00:19:39.476 A:middle
to have both the property
name as gallery data

00:19:39.476 --> 00:19:44.096 A:middle
and also the value as
gallery data's value.

00:19:44.096 --> 00:19:44.926 A:middle
I made that change.

00:19:44.926 --> 00:19:46.056 A:middle
When I'm editing local files

00:19:46.056 --> 00:19:49.566 A:middle
in Web Inspector I can
save those changes directly

00:19:49.726 --> 00:19:51.866 A:middle
and Web Inspector will prompt me
just to make sure I really want

00:19:51.866 --> 00:19:54.706 A:middle
to over ride a local file and
of course, I do in this case.

00:19:55.146 --> 00:19:57.596 A:middle
Once you do that once for a
file, it'll never ask you again,

00:19:57.596 --> 00:19:58.546 A:middle
it'll just save directly.

00:19:59.036 --> 00:20:00.686 A:middle
Let me reload, and
see if that worked.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.036 --> 00:20:00.686 A:middle
Let me reload, and
see if that worked.

00:20:01.756 --> 00:20:03.786 A:middle
There we go, so now I have
my beautiful photography

00:20:03.786 --> 00:20:05.226 A:middle
that I totally took myself.

00:20:05.226 --> 00:20:06.736 A:middle
This is looking really great.

00:20:07.506 --> 00:20:11.046 A:middle
You can see that I have these
galleries, I've laid them

00:20:11.046 --> 00:20:13.206 A:middle
out so they take up the
full width of the display,

00:20:13.206 --> 00:20:16.086 A:middle
I can hover over them to see
the name of the galleries

00:20:16.086 --> 00:20:19.086 A:middle
and I also have this logo in
the middle I can hover over that

00:20:19.086 --> 00:20:21.466 A:middle
to see a menu that comes out
to the side and you'll notice

00:20:21.466 --> 00:20:23.816 A:middle
that occasionally these
galleries rotate between photos

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:25.696 A:middle
and I have a nice
dissolve effect to go

00:20:25.696 --> 00:20:26.536 A:middle
from one to the other.

00:20:26.636 --> 00:20:30.736 A:middle
I want to make sure that
this transition is as smooth

00:20:30.736 --> 00:20:34.546 A:middle
and as efficient as possible so
hopefully some of these tools

00:20:34.546 --> 00:20:36.406 A:middle
that Jono told us about
will help me do that.

00:20:36.716 --> 00:20:38.536 A:middle
The first thing I
want to do is I want

00:20:38.536 --> 00:20:39.456 A:middle
to turn on paint flashing.

00:20:39.456 --> 00:20:41.256 A:middle
I'm going to go to
the elements tab

00:20:41.656 --> 00:20:45.046 A:middle
and the paintbrush tab is
here, I'll select that.

00:20:45.906 --> 00:20:47.976 A:middle
Now you can see the
red rectangles

00:20:47.976 --> 00:20:50.406 A:middle
as the images transition
from one image to the next.

00:20:50.406 --> 00:20:52.256 A:middle
The first thing I'm noticing
is that for the duration

00:20:52.256 --> 00:20:54.426 A:middle
of that transition, I see
a solid red rectangle,

00:20:54.786 --> 00:20:57.766 A:middle
that indicates to me that I'm
probably painting every single

00:20:57.766 --> 00:20:58.826 A:middle
frame of the transition.

00:20:59.326 --> 00:21:01.856 A:middle
Now, I wonder if
that's too expensive?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.326 --> 00:21:01.856 A:middle
Now, I wonder if
that's too expensive?

00:21:02.636 --> 00:21:03.916 A:middle
What I'd like to use
is use the I want

00:21:03.916 --> 00:21:05.736 A:middle
to use the frames timeline

00:21:05.736 --> 00:21:08.806 A:middle
to tell me whether I'm
doing too much work

00:21:08.806 --> 00:21:10.876 A:middle
and maybe blowing my budget

00:21:10.876 --> 00:21:12.656 A:middle
for a 60 frames per
second animation.

00:21:12.696 --> 00:21:14.286 A:middle
I can switch to the
timelines tab.

00:21:15.336 --> 00:21:18.436 A:middle
And I can see that when I
reloaded it automatically

00:21:18.466 --> 00:21:21.246 A:middle
recorded a timeline for me so
I don't need to do that again.

00:21:21.596 --> 00:21:23.956 A:middle
For the most part, you know,
this is looking really good.

00:21:23.956 --> 00:21:26.806 A:middle
It's looking like I'm staying
within 60 frames per second.

00:21:26.806 --> 00:21:29.406 A:middle
But there were some frames
here that exceeded my budget

00:21:29.406 --> 00:21:30.326 A:middle
like this one right here.

00:21:30.496 --> 00:21:33.066 A:middle
I can click and drag to
select a subset of this

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:36.566 A:middle
and then you can see that
it filters the records tab

00:21:36.656 --> 00:21:37.896 A:middle
to just include that subset.

00:21:38.206 --> 00:21:42.326 A:middle
I can expand some of these and
see the work that was done,

00:21:42.326 --> 00:21:44.136 A:middle
style and validation,
recalculation,

00:21:45.446 --> 00:21:48.006 A:middle
time refiring, things like that.

00:21:49.386 --> 00:21:50.926 A:middle
Here's one that's interesting.

00:21:51.596 --> 00:21:53.846 A:middle
It's telling me that an
animation frame is fired based

00:21:53.846 --> 00:21:56.856 A:middle
on request animation
frame, it's even telling me

00:21:56.856 --> 00:21:58.826 A:middle
that I've invalidated
a style and it's going

00:21:58.826 --> 00:22:01.046 A:middle
to let me jump right
to that line that did

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.826 --> 00:22:01.046 A:middle
to let me jump right
to that line that did

00:22:01.046 --> 00:22:02.176 A:middle
that style invalidation.

00:22:02.276 --> 00:22:03.946 A:middle
That's right here.

00:22:04.356 --> 00:22:09.336 A:middle
In fact, the way this animation
is working is I'm using request

00:22:09.336 --> 00:22:13.046 A:middle
animation frame and each frame
I'm running with a duration

00:22:13.046 --> 00:22:16.276 A:middle
of one second, I can even pause
here and inspect these values.

00:22:16.706 --> 00:22:18.196 A:middle
Running for a duration
of one second

00:22:18.196 --> 00:22:20.976 A:middle
and I'm just animating the
opacity value from zero to one

00:22:21.026 --> 00:22:23.596 A:middle
over that duration
of one second.

00:22:23.596 --> 00:22:25.386 A:middle
It looks like, at
least in some cases,

00:22:25.386 --> 00:22:28.086 A:middle
this animation is
too expensive to stay

00:22:28.086 --> 00:22:29.956 A:middle
within my 60 frames
per second budget.

00:22:30.326 --> 00:22:32.316 A:middle
I've actually been
planning to transition this

00:22:32.316 --> 00:22:33.446 A:middle
to a CSS transition instead

00:22:33.446 --> 00:22:34.686 A:middle
which I think might
be more efficient.

00:22:35.016 --> 00:22:38.406 A:middle
Let's do that and see if
things get a little better.

00:22:38.406 --> 00:22:39.456 A:middle
I'll select this.

00:22:39.456 --> 00:22:45.146 A:middle
I still want to set this
current class on the image

00:22:45.146 --> 00:22:46.116 A:middle
and I'll talk about that later.

00:22:46.116 --> 00:22:48.296 A:middle
I want to comment
out the rest of this.

00:22:48.296 --> 00:22:50.696 A:middle
I can save that local resource.

00:22:50.696 --> 00:22:52.446 A:middle
I'll confirm that.

00:22:52.666 --> 00:22:56.756 A:middle
Let's go to the elements
tab and I can use the picker

00:22:56.756 --> 00:22:57.836 A:middle
to select one of
these galleries.

00:22:57.836 --> 00:22:58.606 A:middle
I'll choose this one.

00:22:59.426 --> 00:23:02.116 A:middle
Down here we can see that
there are three images

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.426 --> 00:23:02.116 A:middle
Down here we can see that
there are three images

00:23:02.116 --> 00:23:03.496 A:middle
that are stacked on
top of each other.

00:23:03.776 --> 00:23:05.966 A:middle
The one with the
current class right here,

00:23:05.966 --> 00:23:08.586 A:middle
is the one that's
currently being displayed.

00:23:09.386 --> 00:23:12.346 A:middle
In the side-bar I can actually
see what style properties

00:23:12.346 --> 00:23:13.186 A:middle
that current class has.

00:23:13.186 --> 00:23:15.306 A:middle
Right now it is Z index 3.

00:23:16.006 --> 00:23:18.686 A:middle
Let's add some more
properties here.

00:23:18.686 --> 00:23:20.746 A:middle
For one I want to
animate its opacity --

00:23:20.816 --> 00:23:22.946 A:middle
or I want to set its
opacity to one then I want

00:23:22.946 --> 00:23:26.066 A:middle
to use a transition
to animate opacity

00:23:26.606 --> 00:23:29.346 A:middle
over one second using a
linear animation curve.

00:23:30.626 --> 00:23:32.836 A:middle
I'm going to make those changes.

00:23:32.836 --> 00:23:44.636 A:middle
I'm going to save again and
I'm going to reload the page.

00:23:44.846 --> 00:23:47.186 A:middle
Great. Right away you can see

00:23:47.186 --> 00:23:49.306 A:middle
that there is almost no
flashing going on here.

00:23:49.306 --> 00:23:51.446 A:middle
There is an occasional flash
in the beginning and the end,

00:23:51.746 --> 00:23:53.756 A:middle
but for the rest of the time
there is no flashing whatsoever.

00:23:53.756 --> 00:23:56.606 A:middle
That indicates I've gone from
doing software compositing

00:23:56.606 --> 00:24:00.026 A:middle
in my request animation frame
code to letting the engine do --

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:56.606 --> 00:24:00.026 A:middle
in my request animation frame
code to letting the engine do --

00:24:00.026 --> 00:24:03.836 A:middle
to composite the opacity
and hardware which is going

00:24:03.836 --> 00:24:05.816 A:middle
to be a much faster,
smoother experience.

00:24:06.286 --> 00:24:09.056 A:middle
This is looking pretty good but
I'm actually seeing a problem.

00:24:09.056 --> 00:24:12.256 A:middle
I did see one frame animate but
then none of the others did.

00:24:12.476 --> 00:24:15.346 A:middle
It looks like I might have
introduced some sort of bug.

00:24:15.406 --> 00:24:18.036 A:middle
Let's see if we can
figure out what that is.

00:24:18.036 --> 00:24:21.756 A:middle
I happen to know that
in my code I am --

00:24:22.676 --> 00:24:25.946 A:middle
that there's show
next image right here.

00:24:26.256 --> 00:24:27.896 A:middle
Show next image returns
a promise --

00:24:28.706 --> 00:24:33.406 A:middle
let me reload so we can
actually hit my break point.

00:24:33.576 --> 00:24:36.166 A:middle
Show next image is going
to return a promise,

00:24:36.166 --> 00:24:39.186 A:middle
when the promise is
resolved I'm start a timeout

00:24:39.416 --> 00:24:40.486 A:middle
for the next animation.

00:24:40.776 --> 00:24:44.926 A:middle
We can even log the promise
here, show next image

00:24:45.096 --> 00:24:48.236 A:middle
and it is going to tell me
that the state is pending.

00:24:48.376 --> 00:24:49.986 A:middle
This may not be surprising
that it is pending

00:24:49.986 --> 00:24:51.126 A:middle
because I'm pausing
the debugger,

00:24:51.126 --> 00:24:53.406 A:middle
I might not have let the code
that will eventually resolve

00:24:53.406 --> 00:24:55.826 A:middle
that promise run, so
let me resume here.

00:24:57.246 --> 00:24:59.596 A:middle
These start animating
every 2 seconds,

00:24:59.596 --> 00:25:01.326 A:middle
and so by now this
promise should be resolved

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:59.596 --> 00:25:01.326 A:middle
and so by now this
promise should be resolved

00:25:01.326 --> 00:25:02.346 A:middle
if everything is
working correctly.

00:25:02.566 --> 00:25:04.106 A:middle
Even though I'm no longer
pausing that function,

00:25:04.106 --> 00:25:06.026 A:middle
I still have that promise
bound to dollar sign 1

00:25:06.026 --> 00:25:07.796 A:middle
so I can just inspect it again.

00:25:08.166 --> 00:25:09.456 A:middle
I can see that it's
still pending.

00:25:09.606 --> 00:25:12.386 A:middle
I actually think I know
the mistake I made.

00:25:12.776 --> 00:25:15.946 A:middle
I'm going to go back
to my animation frame

00:25:16.446 --> 00:25:19.176 A:middle
and I can see here that I was
resolving the promise at the end

00:25:19.176 --> 00:25:20.506 A:middle
of the request animation frame.

00:25:20.796 --> 00:25:23.396 A:middle
The last animation
frame but I'm not doing

00:25:23.396 --> 00:25:24.566 A:middle
that with the CSS transition.

00:25:24.566 --> 00:25:25.666 A:middle
Let me just fix that real quick.

00:25:26.226 --> 00:25:32.366 A:middle
I'll use an on transition end
listener and resolve that.

00:25:33.296 --> 00:25:36.406 A:middle
Let me save that
change and reload.

00:25:40.176 --> 00:25:42.086 A:middle
And of course I hit
my brake point again.

00:25:42.146 --> 00:25:46.566 A:middle
So let me reload again.

00:25:46.746 --> 00:25:50.136 A:middle
Great. Now we see these
smooth hardware accelerated

00:25:50.616 --> 00:25:53.616 A:middle
transitions, everything
seems to be looking great.

00:25:53.616 --> 00:25:57.106 A:middle
We can see how we can use
these powerful features

00:25:57.106 --> 00:25:59.786 A:middle
like type profiling,
paint flashing,

00:25:59.786 --> 00:26:01.826 A:middle
Rendering Frames
timeline, improved console,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.786 --> 00:26:01.826 A:middle
Rendering Frames
timeline, improved console,

00:26:01.826 --> 00:26:04.936 A:middle
improved debugging to
quickly identify our issues

00:26:04.936 --> 00:26:05.516 A:middle
and fix them.

00:26:05.996 --> 00:26:07.536 A:middle
Thank you, and back to Jono.

00:26:08.516 --> 00:26:13.546 A:middle
[Applause]

00:26:14.046 --> 00:26:15.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JONO WELLS: Thank you, Andy.

00:26:15.716 --> 00:26:20.686 A:middle
So I think you're going
to find really great use

00:26:20.686 --> 00:26:21.396 A:middle
out of this tool.

00:26:23.086 --> 00:26:25.736 A:middle
You're going to want to take the
new features in Web Inspector,

00:26:25.736 --> 00:26:28.526 A:middle
make your site faster, use
the paint flashing tool,

00:26:29.226 --> 00:26:31.686 A:middle
use the rendering frames
timeline and try this in iOS,

00:26:31.686 --> 00:26:33.946 A:middle
this works of course, if
you're connected to a web view,

00:26:34.046 --> 00:26:36.866 A:middle
or Safari on iOS, you
should really try this out.

00:26:37.186 --> 00:26:40.506 A:middle
Performance is particularly
critical on those devices.

00:26:41.966 --> 00:26:43.116 A:middle
Make your code better.

00:26:43.406 --> 00:26:47.096 A:middle
Use the type profiler to get
a lot of great information,

00:26:47.156 --> 00:26:49.616 A:middle
play with the console, play
around with native APIs.

00:26:50.776 --> 00:26:53.736 A:middle
Right. Use these to work
smarter and to work faster.

00:26:54.306 --> 00:26:57.566 A:middle
That's what we have
introduced with Web Inspector.

00:26:57.566 --> 00:27:00.956 A:middle
Now let's go ahead and
talk about a new tool.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:57.566 --> 00:27:00.956 A:middle
Now let's go ahead and
talk about a new tool.

00:27:01.166 --> 00:27:03.236 A:middle
It is called Responsive
Design Mode.

00:27:03.236 --> 00:27:05.286 A:middle
It is new in this
release of Safari 9

00:27:05.956 --> 00:27:09.366 A:middle
and we'll show you what
it is in just a moment.

00:27:09.536 --> 00:27:12.366 A:middle
First I want to talk about
responsive design for a moment

00:27:12.366 --> 00:27:14.286 A:middle
and why it is particularly
important now.

00:27:14.286 --> 00:27:17.576 A:middle
I'm sure most of you know
what responsive design is,

00:27:18.116 --> 00:27:23.006 A:middle
it is making sure that your
content will automatically fit

00:27:23.006 --> 00:27:26.356 A:middle
and give a great experience
for any screen size.

00:27:26.956 --> 00:27:29.046 A:middle
It is particularly important
that you do this correctly.

00:27:29.836 --> 00:27:33.856 A:middle
Now, up until this point some
of you may have said, well,

00:27:33.856 --> 00:27:38.416 A:middle
I can just, you know, sniff the
user agent string, I can figure

00:27:38.416 --> 00:27:39.816 A:middle
out what kind of device I'm on.

00:27:40.036 --> 00:27:42.256 A:middle
I know that I'm running a
web view inside of an app,

00:27:42.256 --> 00:27:44.156 A:middle
I know exactly what
devices I'm targeting.

00:27:44.466 --> 00:27:45.196 A:middle
So I don't really need

00:27:45.196 --> 00:27:49.446 A:middle
to do responsive design
the way it was meant to be.

00:27:49.686 --> 00:27:51.856 A:middle
We've made that a bit
trickier for you now

00:27:52.666 --> 00:27:56.056 A:middle
because of multitasking.

00:27:56.056 --> 00:27:58.956 A:middle
Now web views might be resizing,

00:27:58.956 --> 00:28:01.876 A:middle
you don't exactly know how
wide they're going to be

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:58.956 --> 00:28:01.876 A:middle
you don't exactly know how
wide they're going to be

00:28:01.876 --> 00:28:07.966 A:middle
and they're going to be resizing
without reloading your content.

00:28:08.786 --> 00:28:12.146 A:middle
Right. We want to instead
of targeting a device,

00:28:12.396 --> 00:28:14.996 A:middle
we want to make sure we're
using features like @supports,

00:28:15.256 --> 00:28:17.746 A:middle
media queries, source set,

00:28:17.926 --> 00:28:22.876 A:middle
serving different pixel
resolution images to your users,

00:28:22.876 --> 00:28:25.356 A:middle
we want to make sure that
our content will stretch

00:28:25.356 --> 00:28:26.626 A:middle
to any screen.

00:28:26.816 --> 00:28:29.246 A:middle
To help you do that
without having to go,

00:28:29.246 --> 00:28:32.116 A:middle
and open up the iOS simulator
and play around, we have brought

00:28:32.116 --> 00:28:35.366 A:middle
to you a new tool that going
to help you test your layouts

00:28:35.366 --> 00:28:38.696 A:middle
and just make sure that
they're properly responsive

00:28:38.696 --> 00:28:40.966 A:middle
and give you some ways
to test them in the sizes

00:28:40.966 --> 00:28:42.176 A:middle
for our devices as well.

00:28:42.356 --> 00:28:43.706 A:middle
That's Responsive Design Mode.

00:28:44.236 --> 00:28:47.786 A:middle
You can find it in the develop
menu and when you turn it on,

00:28:47.786 --> 00:28:50.686 A:middle
your content will
shrink to this view.

00:28:51.536 --> 00:28:52.826 A:middle
This is Responsive Design Mode.

00:28:53.106 --> 00:28:55.526 A:middle
It has a few interesting
features and the first one,

00:28:55.726 --> 00:28:58.916 A:middle
we have handles on the side so
you can stretch your content

00:28:59.166 --> 00:29:01.116 A:middle
as small or as big
as you want to.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:59.166 --> 00:29:01.116 A:middle
as small or as big
as you want to.

00:29:01.116 --> 00:29:05.596 A:middle
It will actually automatically
scale so if you want

00:29:05.816 --> 00:29:07.156 A:middle
to simulate your content

00:29:07.306 --> 00:29:11.476 A:middle
on a giant 70-inch display
let's say, you can do that.

00:29:12.576 --> 00:29:18.466 A:middle
We also built in navigation with
presets for all of our devices

00:29:18.546 --> 00:29:21.966 A:middle
so that you can automatically
set it to different screens.

00:29:21.966 --> 00:29:24.826 A:middle
We actually have built in all
the multitasking configurations

00:29:24.826 --> 00:29:28.676 A:middle
in here as well, as you
will see in a moment.

00:29:28.676 --> 00:29:31.936 A:middle
For the iPads that are up there,
you can click, it will show you,

00:29:31.936 --> 00:29:33.776 A:middle
it'll automatically
resize your content

00:29:33.956 --> 00:29:37.356 A:middle
to those configurations
We also allow you to test

00:29:37.356 --> 00:29:40.506 A:middle
to make sure you're covering
1X, 2X, and 3X images.

00:29:42.106 --> 00:29:44.116 A:middle
Additionally, we
do give you a tool

00:29:44.116 --> 00:29:46.906 A:middle
to set the user agent string
because you might need

00:29:46.906 --> 00:29:49.666 A:middle
to support a very old
browser, legacy browser

00:29:49.846 --> 00:29:52.986 A:middle
and make sure you get away
from using user agent strings

00:29:53.196 --> 00:29:56.586 A:middle
to target the different screens
that your concept will run on.

00:29:57.136 --> 00:29:58.366 A:middle
Right. To be forward thinking.

00:29:58.576 --> 00:29:59.736 A:middle
This tool will help
you make sure

00:29:59.736 --> 00:30:01.286 A:middle
that you don't break anything

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.736 --> 00:30:01.286 A:middle
that you don't break anything

00:30:01.286 --> 00:30:03.396 A:middle
when the user agent string
changes and make sure

00:30:03.396 --> 00:30:05.456 A:middle
that you have properly gotten
away from that as well.

00:30:06.246 --> 00:30:08.716 A:middle
Now to show you this tool in
action and how it can be useful,

00:30:08.716 --> 00:30:11.106 A:middle
I would like to bring
Andy back up to the stage

00:30:11.286 --> 00:30:13.346 A:middle
to take his site a
little bit further.

00:30:13.386 --> 00:30:13.666 A:middle
Andy.

00:30:14.516 --> 00:30:17.806 A:middle
[Applause]

00:30:18.306 --> 00:30:19.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; ANDY ESTES: Thank
you, again, Jono.

00:30:20.086 --> 00:30:22.436 A:middle
Let's just jump right in
to Responsive Design Mode.

00:30:26.256 --> 00:30:27.756 A:middle
Here we are.

00:30:27.756 --> 00:30:31.206 A:middle
I currently have a preset
set for the iPad mini 3.

00:30:31.206 --> 00:30:34.096 A:middle
Let's also explore some
of these desktop sizes.

00:30:34.096 --> 00:30:36.196 A:middle
One of the great things about
this is I can actually size it

00:30:36.616 --> 00:30:38.396 A:middle
to a resolution larger
than my monitor.

00:30:38.716 --> 00:30:43.446 A:middle
Right now you can see that I
have a width of 2536 pixels

00:30:43.446 --> 00:30:45.126 A:middle
which is definitely
larger than this monitor.

00:30:45.126 --> 00:30:48.836 A:middle
So that's useful, but I already
knew that my site looked good

00:30:49.016 --> 00:30:50.966 A:middle
on desktop Viewport sizes.

00:30:51.266 --> 00:30:53.386 A:middle
I want to make sure that
everything works well

00:30:53.436 --> 00:30:56.966 A:middle
on iOS devices as well, iPhones
and iPads, I can click these

00:30:56.966 --> 00:30:57.966 A:middle
and quickly cycle through,

00:30:57.966 --> 00:31:00.166 A:middle
here is an iPad error
in landscape mode.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:57.966 --> 00:31:00.166 A:middle
here is an iPad error
in landscape mode.

00:31:00.166 --> 00:31:03.026 A:middle
Here are some of the
multitasking modes.

00:31:03.206 --> 00:31:07.796 A:middle
If I keep going it'll rotate
to portrait and I can also look

00:31:07.796 --> 00:31:08.996 A:middle
at the multitasking modes there.

00:31:09.356 --> 00:31:11.026 A:middle
I'm starting to notice
that in some

00:31:11.026 --> 00:31:13.916 A:middle
of these configurations
my site --

00:31:13.916 --> 00:31:16.456 A:middle
the Viewport is really
too narrow to be useful.

00:31:16.756 --> 00:31:18.846 A:middle
For example, I really can't
see much of these photos

00:31:18.846 --> 00:31:20.976 A:middle
if I rollover this menu,
the text is clipped.

00:31:20.976 --> 00:31:22.956 A:middle
This isn't a really
good experience.

00:31:22.956 --> 00:31:25.236 A:middle
Let's see if I can make
some changes to make this --

00:31:25.236 --> 00:31:28.736 A:middle
make my site more responsive
at these types of Viewports.

00:31:28.776 --> 00:31:30.656 A:middle
I'm going to bring the Web
Inspector back up again.

00:31:30.656 --> 00:31:31.986 A:middle
One of the great things
about this tool is

00:31:31.986 --> 00:31:33.646 A:middle
that you can use the
Inspector in conjunction

00:31:34.106 --> 00:31:35.226 A:middle
with Responsive Design Mode.

00:31:35.226 --> 00:31:36.176 A:middle
Let's dock it on the side

00:31:36.596 --> 00:31:38.386 A:middle
so that I have more
screen real estate here.

00:31:39.146 --> 00:31:40.556 A:middle
Let's turn off the
paint flashing

00:31:41.236 --> 00:31:45.056 A:middle
which is annoying at this point.

00:31:45.056 --> 00:31:46.476 A:middle
Let's do a few quick changes.

00:31:46.476 --> 00:31:48.496 A:middle
First off, let's get rid
of this logo in the middle

00:31:48.496 --> 00:31:51.136 A:middle
since the menu doesn't
have room to fit,

00:31:51.136 --> 00:31:52.656 A:middle
I don't think it's
worth displaying

00:31:52.656 --> 00:31:57.666 A:middle
and I also show the names of the
galleries on hover so let's set

00:31:57.666 --> 00:31:58.736 A:middle
that to display non-grade.

00:31:58.736 --> 00:32:01.046 A:middle
In terms of these images,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:58.736 --> 00:32:01.046 A:middle
In terms of these images,

00:32:01.046 --> 00:32:03.176 A:middle
I have so little screen real
estate I'd really like them

00:32:03.176 --> 00:32:05.816 A:middle
to take up the entire Viewport.

00:32:05.876 --> 00:32:09.806 A:middle
Right now I'm specifying
that they are using 50%

00:32:09.806 --> 00:32:12.136 A:middle
of the Viewport width and
height, let's make that 100.

00:32:12.656 --> 00:32:18.716 A:middle
Great. So now I have just
one gallery per screen

00:32:18.716 --> 00:32:19.536 A:middle
which is really nice.

00:32:19.536 --> 00:32:22.416 A:middle
Now you'll notice I have these
hover effects which works great

00:32:22.416 --> 00:32:24.766 A:middle
on a desktop but on iOS
devices you won't have hover

00:32:25.086 --> 00:32:26.786 A:middle
and I also don't have my
menu it would be great

00:32:26.786 --> 00:32:28.186 A:middle
if this text is just
always there.

00:32:28.586 --> 00:32:30.476 A:middle
Let's explore doing that.

00:32:30.846 --> 00:32:35.086 A:middle
I'm going to enable the
hover pseudo class here.

00:32:35.086 --> 00:32:36.646 A:middle
You see that it displayed.

00:32:36.946 --> 00:32:38.426 A:middle
There are a few things
that happen on hover.

00:32:38.426 --> 00:32:41.936 A:middle
The first is that the
UI is capacity one,

00:32:42.086 --> 00:32:43.566 A:middle
but let's just make
that always happen.

00:32:44.666 --> 00:32:47.126 A:middle
Second, you will notice
there is an overlay

00:32:47.126 --> 00:32:49.426 A:middle
that goes to opacity 0.

00:32:49.806 --> 00:32:52.456 A:middle
Let's just make it
always opacity 0.

00:32:52.456 --> 00:32:58.426 A:middle
I have my labels all the
time which is what I want.

00:32:58.786 --> 00:33:01.506 A:middle
One more change I want to
make, I went to the What's New

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:58.786 --> 00:33:01.506 A:middle
One more change I want to
make, I went to the What's New

00:33:01.506 --> 00:33:03.396 A:middle
in WebKit session
yesterday and I learned

00:33:03.396 --> 00:33:05.306 A:middle
about this new feature
called Scroll Snap Points,

00:33:05.306 --> 00:33:07.916 A:middle
and I would love it if as I
scroll through the galleries

00:33:07.966 --> 00:33:11.976 A:middle
if it snapped exactly
to each gallery.

00:33:12.236 --> 00:33:14.396 A:middle
I'll try to add that real
quick, I'm going to the body tag

00:33:15.006 --> 00:33:20.936 A:middle
and I'll do a WebKit scroll
snap type, make it mandatory

00:33:21.206 --> 00:33:24.426 A:middle
and then I'll do WebKit
scroll snap points

00:33:24.426 --> 00:33:27.776 A:middle
and in the wide direction
I'll repeat every Viewport.

00:33:29.506 --> 00:33:30.646 A:middle
Let's look at that.

00:33:31.866 --> 00:33:33.546 A:middle
Perfect. Beautiful,
it just snaps right

00:33:33.546 --> 00:33:34.376 A:middle
into place as I scroll.

00:33:34.376 --> 00:33:35.526 A:middle
I really like that.

00:33:36.006 --> 00:33:38.186 A:middle
There is a number of other
changes that I have decided

00:33:38.186 --> 00:33:40.896 A:middle
to make, and I have actually
baked these into a media query

00:33:41.436 --> 00:33:42.316 A:middle
that I've added right here.

00:33:42.786 --> 00:33:47.966 A:middle
I'll just uncomment that and
save it then reload my site.

00:33:48.656 --> 00:33:50.686 A:middle
You can see I added a little
text scroll to see more

00:33:50.686 --> 00:33:51.616 A:middle
at the bottom, which is nice.

00:33:51.616 --> 00:33:53.056 A:middle
I moved my icon to
the upper right,

00:33:53.056 --> 00:33:54.086 A:middle
it doesn't bring up a menu.

00:33:54.486 --> 00:33:56.366 A:middle
And now with these settings --

00:33:56.366 --> 00:33:58.806 A:middle
this is looking good
at this Viewport,

00:33:58.806 --> 00:34:01.256 A:middle
let's make sure things work
well at other Viewports.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:58.806 --> 00:34:01.256 A:middle
let's make sure things work
well at other Viewports.

00:34:01.296 --> 00:34:03.926 A:middle
If I go to the wider size, I
still get my original design,

00:34:04.266 --> 00:34:05.796 A:middle
and then as I go down
to smaller sizes,

00:34:05.796 --> 00:34:09.275 A:middle
I see the narrow Viewport
responsive design.

00:34:09.335 --> 00:34:10.266 A:middle
This is great.

00:34:10.266 --> 00:34:13.275 A:middle
It is really easy to use
this tool in conjunction

00:34:13.275 --> 00:34:15.466 A:middle
with the Web Inspector to
see how your contents look

00:34:15.466 --> 00:34:16.576 A:middle
at different Viewport sizes

00:34:16.856 --> 00:34:19.656 A:middle
and make quick changes
to effect the design.

00:34:20.036 --> 00:34:21.326 A:middle
Thank you, and back to Jono.

00:34:22.516 --> 00:34:28.956 A:middle
[Applause]

00:34:29.456 --> 00:34:30.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JONO WELLS: All right.

00:34:31.295 --> 00:34:35.186 A:middle
Andy, thank you for
showing us that.

00:34:35.545 --> 00:34:36.926 A:middle
That's Responsive Design Mode.

00:34:37.496 --> 00:34:43.686 A:middle
If you're not doing responsive
design for the content

00:34:43.686 --> 00:34:45.616 A:middle
of your applications or
for your web content,

00:34:45.616 --> 00:34:46.775 A:middle
now is the time to start.

00:34:47.226 --> 00:34:50.386 A:middle
It is a good idea
because, again,

00:34:50.485 --> 00:34:52.735 A:middle
something like multitasking
just come out of nowhere just

00:34:52.735 --> 00:34:54.446 A:middle
like that and mess
your content up.

00:34:54.446 --> 00:34:56.096 A:middle
You don't want that to happen.

00:34:56.126 --> 00:34:57.506 A:middle
We have added Responsive
Design Mode.

00:34:57.506 --> 00:35:01.686 A:middle
The focus is on layout, image
resolution and being able

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:57.506 --> 00:35:01.686 A:middle
The focus is on layout, image
resolution and being able

00:35:01.686 --> 00:35:05.356 A:middle
to stay focused in Safari
in the Development Tools

00:35:05.606 --> 00:35:09.466 A:middle
so you don't have to leave and
go off to simulator or a plug-in

00:35:09.466 --> 00:35:11.526 A:middle
of an actual device
to test your layouts.

00:35:11.936 --> 00:35:14.136 A:middle
We have all the presets
for the devices we make,

00:35:14.136 --> 00:35:16.076 A:middle
you can set your own
presets as you saw,

00:35:16.506 --> 00:35:19.046 A:middle
it works right alongside Web
Inspector so you can debug

00:35:19.046 --> 00:35:20.056 A:middle
as you normally would.

00:35:20.566 --> 00:35:22.146 A:middle
This is new in Safari 9.

00:35:22.746 --> 00:35:24.446 A:middle
It is a really cool tool.

00:35:24.586 --> 00:35:28.396 A:middle
Try it out.

00:35:30.556 --> 00:35:35.536 A:middle
Along with Web Inspector you
now have a very powerful set

00:35:35.536 --> 00:35:39.566 A:middle
of tools to take your designs,
make them smooth, feel great,

00:35:39.676 --> 00:35:41.766 A:middle
make sure that they're
error free and make sure

00:35:41.906 --> 00:35:44.966 A:middle
that they work across
different screen sizes.

00:35:45.646 --> 00:35:52.166 A:middle
When you leave here please
-- first of all, get OS X,

00:35:52.256 --> 00:35:54.326 A:middle
El Capitan, get the
developer release,

00:35:54.616 --> 00:35:55.786 A:middle
if you don't have it already,

00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:57.566 A:middle
turn on the develop
menu in Safari.

00:35:59.236 --> 00:36:02.656 A:middle
Customize Web Inspector to your
liking, play with the interface,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:59.236 --> 00:36:02.656 A:middle
Customize Web Inspector to your
liking, play with the interface,

00:36:02.656 --> 00:36:04.096 A:middle
because I think you're
really going to like it.

00:36:04.096 --> 00:36:06.676 A:middle
It is a lot cleaner, everything
is a lot easier to find.

00:36:07.136 --> 00:36:08.786 A:middle
Play around with paint flashing

00:36:08.786 --> 00:36:10.146 A:middle
and the rendering
frames timeline.

00:36:10.596 --> 00:36:12.786 A:middle
Even if you think that you
have the best performance

00:36:12.886 --> 00:36:15.676 A:middle
that web content has ever had in
the history of all web content,

00:36:16.516 --> 00:36:18.466 A:middle
this will tell you
something about your site

00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:21.766 A:middle
and how it is working on WebKit,
how it's working in Safari,

00:36:22.336 --> 00:36:25.546 A:middle
right, and you might discover
something you didn't know.

00:36:26.556 --> 00:36:29.066 A:middle
Right. The second I use paint
flashing for the first time

00:36:29.066 --> 00:36:30.516 A:middle
for instance I had a site,

00:36:30.516 --> 00:36:32.376 A:middle
I discovered I had
some painting happening

00:36:32.376 --> 00:36:33.436 A:middle
in the background I didn't want

00:36:33.436 --> 00:36:35.796 A:middle
that was stuttering the
animation for everything else,

00:36:35.796 --> 00:36:36.896 A:middle
I was able to eliminate it.

00:36:37.136 --> 00:36:38.156 A:middle
It just happened immediately.

00:36:38.156 --> 00:36:38.686 A:middle
It was great.

00:36:39.356 --> 00:36:41.106 A:middle
Use the type information
profiler.

00:36:42.306 --> 00:36:44.386 A:middle
Right. Take -- we're going to --

00:36:44.386 --> 00:36:46.566 A:middle
this tool, it takes all
of the code, makes it look

00:36:46.566 --> 00:36:48.906 A:middle
like a light bright board if you
ever played with one of those.

00:36:48.906 --> 00:36:51.176 A:middle
It's amazing, it's going to
give you great information.

00:36:51.446 --> 00:36:52.036 A:middle
Play with that.

00:36:52.156 --> 00:36:54.446 A:middle
Play in the console
with the object views,

00:36:54.656 --> 00:36:56.306 A:middle
try Responsive Design Mode.

00:36:56.306 --> 00:37:02.746 A:middle
With all of these tools, use
them to make your content shine.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:56.306 --> 00:37:02.746 A:middle
With all of these tools, use
them to make your content shine.

00:37:03.656 --> 00:37:08.006 A:middle
Now, it is really important
