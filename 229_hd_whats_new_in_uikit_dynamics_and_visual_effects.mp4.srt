&gt;&gt; MICHAEL TURNER: Welcome
to the final day of WWDC,

00:00:34.636 --> 00:00:37.006 A:middle
and 'What's New in UIKit
Dynamics and Visual Effects.'

00:00:37.346 --> 00:00:38.296 A:middle
My name is Michael Turner,

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:40.186 A:middle
joined by my colleague
David Duncan.

00:00:40.536 --> 00:00:42.216 A:middle
We are both on the UIKit
team here at Apple.

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:45.176 A:middle
So before we get started today,

00:00:45.406 --> 00:00:47.286 A:middle
I just want to recommend
some great sessions.

00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:48.846 A:middle
Since this is an
introductory talk,

00:00:49.076 --> 00:00:49.946 A:middle
we have some great sessions

00:00:49.946 --> 00:00:52.826 A:middle
from years past covering UIKit
Dynamics and visual effects.

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:56.486 A:middle
So today we are going to
start with a brief overview

00:00:56.706 --> 00:00:58.736 A:middle
of the dynamic animation
system, and we'll do

00:00:58.736 --> 00:01:01.226 A:middle
that with a basic example, and
then we are going to dive right

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:58.736 --> 00:01:01.226 A:middle
that with a basic example, and
then we are going to dive right

00:01:01.226 --> 00:01:03.656 A:middle
into what's new this
year with UIKit Dynamics.

00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:06.106 A:middle
Then David's going to
come up and talk to us

00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:11.286 A:middle
about visual effects, and
how you can utilize those

00:01:11.286 --> 00:01:12.096 A:middle
in your application.

00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:14.466 A:middle
And finally, we are going
to talk a little bit

00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:16.676 A:middle
about best practices
using UIKit Dynamics

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.756 A:middle
and auto layout in
your application.

00:01:20.296 --> 00:01:23.186 A:middle
So when we talk about UIKit
Dynamics we are talking

00:01:23.186 --> 00:01:26.526 A:middle
about a 2D, physics-inspired
animation interaction system.

00:01:27.406 --> 00:01:29.746 A:middle
This has a very composable
and declarative API

00:01:30.376 --> 00:01:32.876 A:middle
for exposing high level
animations in your app.

00:01:33.756 --> 00:01:36.346 A:middle
We are not talking about
replacement for Core Animation

00:01:36.586 --> 00:01:39.206 A:middle
or UIView animations,
rather another tool

00:01:39.206 --> 00:01:41.606 A:middle
to help you create great
custom effects in your app.

00:01:42.176 --> 00:01:43.436 A:middle
So let's look at an example.

00:01:44.276 --> 00:01:46.636 A:middle
So here we have a
basic sliding view

00:01:46.636 --> 00:01:51.286 A:middle
and the user can pan the view,
but if you let go it falls back

00:01:51.286 --> 00:01:53.216 A:middle
down as if under the
influence of gravity.

00:01:53.216 --> 00:01:56.426 A:middle
Now, it doesn't fall through
the bottom of the phone.

00:01:56.426 --> 00:01:58.636 A:middle
Rather, it stops on the
bottom edge, bounces a bit,

00:01:58.636 --> 00:01:59.376 A:middle
and then comes to rest.

00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:02.726 A:middle
So let's look at how we can
create this basic example.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:02.726 A:middle
So let's look at how we can
create this basic example.

00:02:03.496 --> 00:02:04.296 A:middle
First you need to start

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:06.016 A:middle
by determining a
great reference view.

00:02:06.316 --> 00:02:08.216 A:middle
Here, we've chosen the
view controller's view

00:02:08.356 --> 00:02:09.506 A:middle
that contains our sliding view.

00:02:10.116 --> 00:02:12.826 A:middle
And once we have a
reference view, we then need

00:02:12.826 --> 00:02:15.596 A:middle
to create a dynamic animator and
associate that reference view.

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:18.716 A:middle
The dynamic animator will
hold the overall context

00:02:18.716 --> 00:02:21.846 A:middle
for our animations, and its
main job is to keep track

00:02:21.846 --> 00:02:23.536 A:middle
of behaviors and dynamic items.

00:02:24.726 --> 00:02:27.296 A:middle
So for our sliding example,
we have a sliding behavior.

00:02:27.716 --> 00:02:30.046 A:middle
And one of the great things
about UI dynamic behavior,

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:32.336 A:middle
is that higher-level
behaviors can be composed

00:02:32.336 --> 00:02:33.206 A:middle
of more primitive ones.

00:02:34.076 --> 00:02:36.516 A:middle
So our sliding behavior is
nothing more than a composition

00:02:36.516 --> 00:02:38.776 A:middle
of gravity, collision,
and attachment.

00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:42.426 A:middle
And later on, we will show you
how we used UIAttachmentBehavior

00:02:42.426 --> 00:02:44.966 A:middle
and the new things we've added
there to make this even simpler

00:02:45.076 --> 00:02:47.376 A:middle
than it would have
been in the past.

00:02:47.526 --> 00:02:48.926 A:middle
So once we have our
sliding behavior,

00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:50.516 A:middle
we now need a dynamic item.

00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:53.586 A:middle
Here we've chosen the
sliding view, just a UIView

00:02:53.936 --> 00:02:56.276 A:middle
which automatically conforms
to the dynamic item protocol,

00:02:56.396 --> 00:02:57.156 A:middle
so it's a great option.

00:02:57.846 --> 00:03:00.126 A:middle
So we take our dynamic
item, associate it

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:57.846 --> 00:03:00.126 A:middle
So we take our dynamic
item, associate it

00:03:00.126 --> 00:03:01.076 A:middle
with the sliding behavior,

00:03:01.076 --> 00:03:02.746 A:middle
and the sliding behavior
to the animator.

00:03:02.746 --> 00:03:05.966 A:middle
Now the animator will
automatically determine

00:03:05.966 --> 00:03:08.636 A:middle
when the system is at rest or in
motion, so this is all you need

00:03:08.636 --> 00:03:10.346 A:middle
to create this great effect.

00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:13.336 A:middle
So now we have seen
a basic example.

00:03:14.496 --> 00:03:16.726 A:middle
This is what's new this
year in UIKit dynamics.

00:03:17.216 --> 00:03:17.986 A:middle
We have support

00:03:17.986 --> 00:03:20.816 A:middle
for non-rectangular collision
bounds on UIDynamicItem.

00:03:20.816 --> 00:03:24.166 A:middle
We have a brand new
UIDynamicItemGroup

00:03:24.316 --> 00:03:26.496 A:middle
that allows multiple items
to behave like one item

00:03:26.496 --> 00:03:29.456 A:middle
in the engine, and we
have a brand new behavior

00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:31.166 A:middle
that models vector force fields.

00:03:32.766 --> 00:03:35.876 A:middle
We have some basic enhancements
to UIDynamicItemBehavior,

00:03:36.076 --> 00:03:39.226 A:middle
as well as UISnapBehavior, and
we'll see some great additions

00:03:39.226 --> 00:03:42.006 A:middle
to UIAttachmentBehavior,
and we will finish

00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:44.066 A:middle
up with some new
ways that you can use

00:03:44.066 --> 00:03:46.106 A:middle
to debug your dynamic
animations.

00:03:46.906 --> 00:03:52.566 A:middle
So, in iOS 9, we
added UIDynamicItem

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:55.556 A:middle
CollisionBoundsType which
offers you three new ways

00:03:55.906 --> 00:03:58.406 A:middle
to specify the collision
bounds for your dynamic item.

00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:02.306 A:middle
And by default your collision
bounds will be rectangular

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:02.306 A:middle
And by default your collision
bounds will be rectangular

00:04:02.496 --> 00:04:04.796 A:middle
matching what's returned
from the bounds accesser

00:04:05.076 --> 00:04:06.236 A:middle
on the dynamic item protocol.

00:04:07.396 --> 00:04:10.486 A:middle
And now you can specify an
ellipse type, which will derive

00:04:10.486 --> 00:04:12.906 A:middle
from the bounds width and
bounds height on the protocol.

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:17.076 A:middle
And finally, you can specify
a UI BezierPath to use

00:04:17.076 --> 00:04:18.536 A:middle
for the collision bounds
of your dynamic item.

00:04:20.755 --> 00:04:23.666 A:middle
Now, to accomplish this, we have
taken the existing dynamic item

00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:27.056 A:middle
protocol and we have extended
it with two optional properties.

00:04:27.416 --> 00:04:28.506 A:middle
And if you don't
implement either

00:04:28.506 --> 00:04:30.936 A:middle
of these optional properties
you will receive rectangular

00:04:30.936 --> 00:04:32.386 A:middle
collision bounds, as
you have in the past.

00:04:33.286 --> 00:04:35.396 A:middle
If you implement the first
collision bounding type

00:04:35.556 --> 00:04:37.416 A:middle
and return ellipse,
will derive one,

00:04:37.506 --> 00:04:39.356 A:middle
an ellipse from the bounds
width, bounds height.

00:04:39.356 --> 00:04:42.146 A:middle
If you implement the
first and return a path,

00:04:42.146 --> 00:04:43.926 A:middle
we will then call you
back for the second

00:04:43.966 --> 00:04:46.886 A:middle
at which point you will need to
provide a UI BezierPath to use

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:47.766 A:middle
for the collision bounds.

00:04:48.806 --> 00:04:51.526 A:middle
So if we were to model a
collision between items

00:04:51.526 --> 00:04:53.966 A:middle
with different collision bounds,
and let's add a few more here

00:04:53.966 --> 00:04:56.116 A:middle
for good measure, it might
look something like this,

00:04:56.626 --> 00:04:58.986 A:middle
where this collision
looks a lot more realistic

00:04:58.986 --> 00:04:59.796 A:middle
than it would have in the past,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:03.236 A:middle
had all the items had
rectangular collision bounds.

00:05:04.476 --> 00:05:07.886 A:middle
Now, there are a few
restrictions when using a path

00:05:08.116 --> 00:05:10.016 A:middle
for collision bounds
and in particular,

00:05:10.016 --> 00:05:13.186 A:middle
the BezierPath must be convex,
counter-clockwise wound,

00:05:13.576 --> 00:05:14.806 A:middle
and non-self-intersecting.

00:05:15.416 --> 00:05:17.996 A:middle
And these are pretty basic
if you think about it,

00:05:18.796 --> 00:05:19.996 A:middle
nothing too fancy there.

00:05:20.056 --> 00:05:23.536 A:middle
We also need to keep in
mind that the point 00

00:05:23.536 --> 00:05:26.946 A:middle
in the BezierPath will represent
the dynamic item's center point

00:05:27.466 --> 00:05:28.456 A:middle
when the item is on screen.

00:05:29.066 --> 00:05:31.526 A:middle
So that's what's new
in collision bounds.

00:05:31.526 --> 00:05:33.346 A:middle
Let's talk about
dynamic item groups.

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:35.936 A:middle
And this is a basic way
to take multiple items

00:05:36.176 --> 00:05:38.406 A:middle
and make them behave as one
item in the underlying engine.

00:05:39.096 --> 00:05:41.826 A:middle
And the group preserves
respective positions

00:05:42.036 --> 00:05:45.256 A:middle
and each individual collision
bounds for each item.

00:05:45.476 --> 00:05:49.556 A:middle
So for this reason, you should
associate items with a group

00:05:49.836 --> 00:05:51.296 A:middle
and not with behaviors
individually.

00:05:51.296 --> 00:05:53.526 A:middle
Instead associate them with
the group and the group

00:05:53.526 --> 00:05:54.496 A:middle
with any behaviors you would

00:05:54.496 --> 00:05:55.676 A:middle
like to associate
with the animator.

00:05:56.206 --> 00:05:57.966 A:middle
And this will impose
those behaviors

00:05:57.966 --> 00:05:58.976 A:middle
on the items as a whole.

00:05:59.876 --> 00:06:02.526 A:middle
And a group cannot be
added to other groups.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:59.876 --> 00:06:02.526 A:middle
And a group cannot be
added to other groups.

00:06:02.526 --> 00:06:03.886 A:middle
This is a one-level abstraction.

00:06:04.606 --> 00:06:07.026 A:middle
So this can be a great
way to create concave

00:06:07.026 --> 00:06:09.266 A:middle
or other complex
geometry not capable

00:06:09.266 --> 00:06:12.336 A:middle
with the dynamic item
bounds path, and also have

00:06:12.336 --> 00:06:15.626 A:middle
that influenceable by
behaviors as a whole.

00:06:16.316 --> 00:06:19.306 A:middle
So, let's return to that
sliding example for a moment.

00:06:21.496 --> 00:06:24.216 A:middle
So instead of just panning and
having it to fall back down,

00:06:24.216 --> 00:06:27.206 A:middle
let's say we want it to bounce
slightly when the user taps,

00:06:27.206 --> 00:06:28.536 A:middle
maybe to indicate
that we can pan.

00:06:29.286 --> 00:06:31.196 A:middle
And to do this, we just need

00:06:31.196 --> 00:06:33.296 A:middle
to add a brief force
to the sliding view.

00:06:33.896 --> 00:06:35.006 A:middle
So let's take a look
at that force.

00:06:37.116 --> 00:06:40.066 A:middle
So we can model the force as
a vector at the item's center

00:06:40.346 --> 00:06:44.536 A:middle
where the length of the vector
corresponds to the magnitude

00:06:44.536 --> 00:06:47.456 A:middle
of the force and the
vector points up to indicate

00:06:47.456 --> 00:06:49.816 A:middle
that the direction of the force,
in this case we are trying

00:06:49.816 --> 00:06:51.576 A:middle
to move the view
up, so it points up.

00:06:52.366 --> 00:06:55.386 A:middle
And to apply the force, we're
going to use UIPushBehavior --

00:06:56.076 --> 00:06:59.476 A:middle
where UIPushBehavior, if you
recall, has two distinct modes.

00:06:59.896 --> 00:07:03.046 A:middle
It has a continuous mode that
represents a constant force

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.896 --> 00:07:03.046 A:middle
It has a continuous mode that
represents a constant force

00:07:03.046 --> 00:07:05.476 A:middle
over time, and an
instantaneous mode

00:07:05.976 --> 00:07:08.386 A:middle
which represents a brief
force at an instant in time,

00:07:08.536 --> 00:07:09.726 A:middle
otherwise known as an impulse.

00:07:10.606 --> 00:07:13.746 A:middle
So for this interaction, we just
want a brief force so it bounces

00:07:13.746 --> 00:07:15.216 A:middle
and comes back to
rest, so we're going

00:07:15.216 --> 00:07:16.126 A:middle
to use the instantaneous mode.

00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:18.006 A:middle
So we do that; we
get a brief force.

00:07:18.066 --> 00:07:20.406 A:middle
But what is causing the
view to come back down?

00:07:20.486 --> 00:07:22.556 A:middle
We are putting a force on
it that causes it to move up

00:07:22.556 --> 00:07:24.016 A:middle
but it's falling back down.

00:07:24.766 --> 00:07:28.426 A:middle
This is our composite behavior
that was composed of a gravity,

00:07:28.456 --> 00:07:29.736 A:middle
a collision, and attachment.

00:07:30.086 --> 00:07:31.876 A:middle
And so gravity is causing
it to move back down

00:07:31.876 --> 00:07:33.556 A:middle
and then it bounces with
the collision behavior.

00:07:33.556 --> 00:07:35.916 A:middle
But let's look at a
little bit more at gravity

00:07:35.916 --> 00:07:37.106 A:middle
and how that's affecting
our item.

00:07:37.276 --> 00:07:39.986 A:middle
So we look at the
vertical motion over time

00:07:40.666 --> 00:07:43.036 A:middle
of the sliding view,
starting with the instant

00:07:43.036 --> 00:07:44.486 A:middle
that we apply the impulse force.

00:07:44.926 --> 00:07:47.386 A:middle
You will notice that the
force is applied at one point

00:07:47.606 --> 00:07:50.086 A:middle
and then the item kind of moves
up and then arcs back down.

00:07:50.806 --> 00:07:53.126 A:middle
This is because gravity is
affecting it at all positions

00:07:53.126 --> 00:07:54.566 A:middle
and all times in
our diagram here.

00:07:54.886 --> 00:07:57.656 A:middle
If we add those forces in from
gravity, it might look something

00:07:57.656 --> 00:08:01.826 A:middle
like this, where
the force is applied

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:57.656 --> 00:08:01.826 A:middle
like this, where
the force is applied

00:08:01.866 --> 00:08:03.406 A:middle
at all positions and all times.

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:04.976 A:middle
So this is tricky to model.

00:08:05.426 --> 00:08:07.346 A:middle
Maybe we could try and
use UI push behavior,

00:08:07.446 --> 00:08:09.286 A:middle
but it would be pretty
complex, pretty quickly.

00:08:09.976 --> 00:08:12.476 A:middle
So we really need to think of
gravity as more of a field.

00:08:13.376 --> 00:08:15.506 A:middle
And a field's quite
simple, it's just a function

00:08:15.716 --> 00:08:18.816 A:middle
that assigns a vector to each
point within a given domain,

00:08:18.986 --> 00:08:20.776 A:middle
where our domain,
in this example,

00:08:20.776 --> 00:08:21.946 A:middle
is the entire reference view.

00:08:22.236 --> 00:08:24.596 A:middle
So we want gravity to
affect our sliding view

00:08:24.946 --> 00:08:25.996 A:middle
in the entire reference view.

00:08:26.846 --> 00:08:27.276 A:middle
Pretty simple.

00:08:27.276 --> 00:08:30.666 A:middle
So we have taken this idea of a
field and we have extended it.

00:08:31.026 --> 00:08:33.846 A:middle
In iOS 9, we are
introducing UIFieldBehavior.

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:38.206 A:middle
And UIFieldBehavior is a way
that can be added to a region

00:08:38.206 --> 00:08:42.296 A:middle
of your reference view, and the
field is evaluated at each point

00:08:42.296 --> 00:08:43.285 A:middle
within the reference view,

00:08:43.285 --> 00:08:46.456 A:middle
and any resulting forces
are automatically applied

00:08:46.456 --> 00:08:48.246 A:middle
by the dynamic animator
to the items

00:08:48.246 --> 00:08:51.006 A:middle
that have been associated
with the field.

00:08:51.166 --> 00:08:52.136 A:middle
And if you are wondering,

00:08:52.136 --> 00:08:55.236 A:middle
our existing UIGravityBehavior
has been implemented

00:08:55.236 --> 00:08:58.866 A:middle
as a field all along, and
it's important to keep in mind

00:08:58.866 --> 00:09:00.146 A:middle
that this is simplified physics.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.866 --> 00:09:00.146 A:middle
that this is simplified physics.

00:09:00.146 --> 00:09:01.626 A:middle
It's been well tuned
for performance.

00:09:02.016 --> 00:09:04.626 A:middle
I wouldn't use it for building
interstellar space stations

00:09:04.626 --> 00:09:05.306 A:middle
or anything like that.

00:09:06.606 --> 00:09:09.286 A:middle
So let's look at the built-in
field types that we offer.

00:09:09.476 --> 00:09:10.686 A:middle
We've got a rich variety here.

00:09:10.776 --> 00:09:13.846 A:middle
We have linear and
radial gravity, velocity

00:09:13.846 --> 00:09:17.266 A:middle
and drag fields, a vortex field,
we have got a great spring field

00:09:17.266 --> 00:09:19.326 A:middle
that models Hooke's
law, we've got electric

00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:20.476 A:middle
and magnetic field types.

00:09:21.086 --> 00:09:23.176 A:middle
And if these all don't
quite meet your needs,

00:09:23.176 --> 00:09:25.036 A:middle
we also offer a custom
force evaluator,

00:09:25.036 --> 00:09:26.006 A:middle
and we'll see this in a moment.

00:09:26.486 --> 00:09:28.346 A:middle
But let's start with
linear gravity here first.

00:09:29.356 --> 00:09:31.336 A:middle
So the first thing you will
notice is it exists in a region,

00:09:31.676 --> 00:09:34.806 A:middle
in a domain as we previously
said, and it has a strength,

00:09:34.806 --> 00:09:36.386 A:middle
we've used the default
strength of one here,

00:09:36.846 --> 00:09:38.406 A:middle
but it's also a directional
force,

00:09:38.486 --> 00:09:40.236 A:middle
and then we have used
the familiar direction

00:09:40.236 --> 00:09:43.246 A:middle
of gravity here, down,
to show this example,

00:09:43.566 --> 00:09:46.056 A:middle
but this can be directed
anywhere, really.

00:09:46.776 --> 00:09:48.996 A:middle
So let's look at how
radial gravity differs

00:09:48.996 --> 00:09:50.236 A:middle
from that of linear gravity.

00:09:51.096 --> 00:09:55.896 A:middle
And along with existing in a
domain and having a strength,

00:09:55.896 --> 00:09:58.256 A:middle
this has a position
which can be modeled

00:09:58.256 --> 00:10:00.796 A:middle
with radial gravity
as a point mass.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:58.256 --> 00:10:00.796 A:middle
with radial gravity
as a point mass.

00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:03.826 A:middle
And if you recall, the
gravitational force

00:10:03.826 --> 00:10:06.526 A:middle
between two masses is
inversely proportional

00:10:06.876 --> 00:10:08.946 A:middle
to the distance squared
between the two masses.

00:10:09.446 --> 00:10:12.016 A:middle
So, here, that distance
squared between the masses,

00:10:12.016 --> 00:10:14.646 A:middle
that exponent, this is the
fall off value of the field.

00:10:15.216 --> 00:10:17.276 A:middle
So as you get farther away
from the position of the field,

00:10:17.886 --> 00:10:21.126 A:middle
the force due to the
field, it gets -- decreases.

00:10:21.126 --> 00:10:23.796 A:middle
And we also have a minimum
radius property here,

00:10:23.796 --> 00:10:26.576 A:middle
and this is just a
way to specify how far

00:10:26.576 --> 00:10:29.646 A:middle
from the position point
an item must be in order

00:10:29.646 --> 00:10:31.706 A:middle
to feel a resulting
force due to this field.

00:10:33.386 --> 00:10:34.986 A:middle
So we also have a noise field,

00:10:35.516 --> 00:10:37.456 A:middle
and the first thing you will
notice about a noise field is,

00:10:37.456 --> 00:10:40.876 A:middle
it's time varying, and you can
adjust this using the animation

00:10:40.926 --> 00:10:42.466 A:middle
speed with a default
value of one,

00:10:42.816 --> 00:10:44.296 A:middle
and zero would indicate
a static field.

00:10:44.996 --> 00:10:46.976 A:middle
You can also adjust
the level of noise

00:10:46.976 --> 00:10:48.446 A:middle
in the field using the
smoothness property.

00:10:50.726 --> 00:10:52.486 A:middle
So let's look at a
custom field evaluator.

00:10:53.296 --> 00:10:54.796 A:middle
And this is really
quite easy to use.

00:10:54.796 --> 00:10:57.406 A:middle
You create a UIFieldBehavior
and initialize it

00:10:57.686 --> 00:10:58.856 A:middle
with a field evaluation block.

00:10:59.356 --> 00:11:00.666 A:middle
We will then call your block

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.356 --> 00:11:00.666 A:middle
We will then call your block

00:11:00.666 --> 00:11:02.856 A:middle
with several field samples
containing the position,

00:11:03.176 --> 00:11:06.056 A:middle
velocity, mass, and
charge, and time associated

00:11:06.056 --> 00:11:08.436 A:middle
with that field sample
and then you can use

00:11:08.436 --> 00:11:10.546 A:middle
that to determine
any resulting forces.

00:11:11.016 --> 00:11:13.566 A:middle
Here all we did was take the
position, the x position,

00:11:13.956 --> 00:11:15.076 A:middle
and map it to a sin wave.

00:11:15.666 --> 00:11:16.346 A:middle
Pretty cool result.

00:11:16.346 --> 00:11:20.456 A:middle
So these are the -- some of
the basic built-in fields

00:11:20.456 --> 00:11:22.386 A:middle
and a basic overview
of UIFieldBehavior.

00:11:22.606 --> 00:11:25.006 A:middle
I would like to invite up David
to give you a quick example

00:11:25.246 --> 00:11:26.096 A:middle
of showing an inaction.

00:11:27.516 --> 00:11:32.726 A:middle
[Applause]

00:11:33.226 --> 00:11:35.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; DAVID DUNCAN: Hello,
everybody, and we are going

00:11:35.056 --> 00:11:36.666 A:middle
to take you through an
example of something

00:11:36.666 --> 00:11:38.636 A:middle
that I'm certain you
have all seen before.

00:11:40.136 --> 00:11:42.726 A:middle
As I'm sure you have all
used FaceTime at some point

00:11:42.726 --> 00:11:45.576 A:middle
or another, and so we
just have an example

00:11:45.666 --> 00:11:47.266 A:middle
of building a very similar UI

00:11:47.266 --> 00:11:50.056 A:middle
for managing your
face in the screen.

00:11:50.056 --> 00:11:52.806 A:middle
As you have been able to see
as I have gone through here,

00:11:53.306 --> 00:11:55.786 A:middle
the square moves very nicely
as I move it around the screen,

00:11:55.786 --> 00:11:59.006 A:middle
and if I pull it a little away
from the corner it bounces back.

00:11:59.006 --> 00:12:01.096 A:middle
If I pull farther, it has

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.006 --> 00:12:01.096 A:middle
If I pull farther, it has

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:02.836 A:middle
that nice ease-in
curve as we are going.

00:12:02.836 --> 00:12:05.496 A:middle
And if I throw it down, it kind

00:12:05.496 --> 00:12:07.616 A:middle
of bounces off very playfully
all around the edges.

00:12:08.056 --> 00:12:10.376 A:middle
And you will note when I threw
it down, it didn't just kind

00:12:10.376 --> 00:12:12.436 A:middle
of go straight to where
it was supposed to go,

00:12:12.676 --> 00:12:14.796 A:middle
it actually had a little
physics, it bounced off the side

00:12:14.796 --> 00:12:16.506 A:middle
of the screen and came
back into position.

00:12:17.716 --> 00:12:22.096 A:middle
Now, I can do a little thing
and trigger a debugging view

00:12:22.096 --> 00:12:23.976 A:middle
of what those forces
fields look like.

00:12:24.576 --> 00:12:25.716 A:middle
In this case you
can see that we --

00:12:26.516 --> 00:12:31.196 A:middle
[Applause]

00:12:31.696 --> 00:12:34.026 A:middle
In case, you can see that we
have four spring fields running

00:12:34.026 --> 00:12:38.236 A:middle
around here, and we have got an
easy way to explain what's going

00:12:38.236 --> 00:12:40.256 A:middle
on so if we put this
right on the edge,

00:12:40.306 --> 00:12:41.576 A:middle
we know it is going
to bounce back.

00:12:42.446 --> 00:12:44.926 A:middle
And if we kind of straddle
two, then depending

00:12:44.926 --> 00:12:47.016 A:middle
on where we straddle it will
pick one side or the other.

00:12:47.796 --> 00:12:49.336 A:middle
And go through the middle,

00:12:49.696 --> 00:12:50.976 A:middle
and it just picks
whichever is closest.

00:12:51.536 --> 00:12:53.016 A:middle
So let's see how we set this up,

00:12:53.016 --> 00:12:55.916 A:middle
and how we can actually
set this all ourselves.

00:12:56.696 --> 00:13:00.836 A:middle
So the first thing that we have
is this StickyCorners behavior,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:56.696 --> 00:13:00.836 A:middle
So the first thing that we have
is this StickyCorners behavior,

00:13:01.286 --> 00:13:03.826 A:middle
and as Mike mentioned, it's
built up of other behaviors

00:13:03.826 --> 00:13:06.336 A:middle
to form this complex behavior
that does everything we want.

00:13:06.706 --> 00:13:08.446 A:middle
In this case, it has got
a collision behavior,

00:13:08.446 --> 00:13:09.536 A:middle
because we wouldn't
want your face

00:13:09.536 --> 00:13:11.096 A:middle
to rocket off the
side of the screen.

00:13:11.826 --> 00:13:14.236 A:middle
And we have a dynamic
item behavior,

00:13:14.236 --> 00:13:16.296 A:middle
that affects the
properties of that face.

00:13:16.636 --> 00:13:18.216 A:middle
In this case, we
reduce its density

00:13:18.216 --> 00:13:19.966 A:middle
to it's really light
feeling in the engine,

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:22.946 A:middle
but we increase its
resistance to motion so that

00:13:22.946 --> 00:13:25.346 A:middle
when it finds a place to
settle it doesn't keep spinning

00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:26.366 A:middle
around in that location.

00:13:27.136 --> 00:13:28.866 A:middle
And finally we disable rotation,

00:13:28.866 --> 00:13:29.986 A:middle
because that wouldn't
make any sense.

00:13:29.986 --> 00:13:30.906 A:middle
You don't want your
face spinning

00:13:30.906 --> 00:13:32.146 A:middle
around as it's going
around the screen.

00:13:33.556 --> 00:13:35.826 A:middle
Finally, we have
these field behaviors,

00:13:35.826 --> 00:13:38.856 A:middle
the four spring fields that
map out the four corners,

00:13:38.956 --> 00:13:40.586 A:middle
and we add those to
the behavior too.

00:13:40.996 --> 00:13:44.536 A:middle
Now whenever somebody adds
this StickyCorners behavior,

00:13:44.636 --> 00:13:48.396 A:middle
they get all of this
behavior for free.

00:13:48.616 --> 00:13:50.406 A:middle
Next, over here in
the view controller,

00:13:50.966 --> 00:13:52.626 A:middle
we go to all the usual
stuff where we set

00:13:52.626 --> 00:13:56.396 A:middle
up our view hierarchy, but
then we also add a pan gesture

00:13:56.396 --> 00:13:58.676 A:middle
recognizer so that the
user can pick up the face

00:13:58.676 --> 00:13:59.766 A:middle
and move it around the screen.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:00.966 --> 00:14:03.486 A:middle
This long press gesture
recognizer we have here lets me

00:14:03.486 --> 00:14:05.296 A:middle
actually toggle on and
off the debug interface.

00:14:05.916 --> 00:14:07.296 A:middle
We create our dynamic animator

00:14:07.456 --> 00:14:09.776 A:middle
and add the StickyCorners
behavior to it.

00:14:10.196 --> 00:14:12.256 A:middle
So how does that
gesture recognizer work?

00:14:12.746 --> 00:14:15.306 A:middle
Well, as usual, the gesture
recognizer goes between states.

00:14:15.366 --> 00:14:20.046 A:middle
It starts at begin, and when we
begin, we do some bookkeeping

00:14:20.046 --> 00:14:21.326 A:middle
so that we can keep
track of the item,

00:14:21.326 --> 00:14:23.186 A:middle
but we also disable
the sticky behavior.

00:14:23.186 --> 00:14:24.706 A:middle
And I will show you how
we do that in a second.

00:14:25.376 --> 00:14:27.826 A:middle
Similarly, when it's changed
we just move the item around.

00:14:28.506 --> 00:14:30.146 A:middle
And when it cancels or ends,

00:14:30.516 --> 00:14:32.066 A:middle
this is where we do
something really special.

00:14:32.586 --> 00:14:35.506 A:middle
We check the velocity that
the pan gesture recognizer had

00:14:35.506 --> 00:14:37.376 A:middle
when the user stopped
interacting with it,

00:14:37.926 --> 00:14:40.316 A:middle
and we use that to
add velocity back

00:14:40.316 --> 00:14:41.706 A:middle
into our dynamic item system.

00:14:41.776 --> 00:14:44.546 A:middle
And this is so that when the
user throws that view around,

00:14:44.726 --> 00:14:47.516 A:middle
it continues moving with the
force of the user's action,

00:14:47.756 --> 00:14:49.706 A:middle
rather than just suddenly
stopping and being taken

00:14:49.706 --> 00:14:51.046 A:middle
over entirely by the field.

00:14:51.736 --> 00:14:53.086 A:middle
And the whole reason
why we disabled

00:14:53.086 --> 00:14:54.486 A:middle
and enabled it is
for the same reason.

00:14:54.826 --> 00:14:56.226 A:middle
We don't want the fields

00:14:56.276 --> 00:14:58.016 A:middle
to be active while the
user is moving it around,

00:14:58.016 --> 00:14:58.976 A:middle
otherwise it is going to slip

00:14:58.976 --> 00:15:00.116 A:middle
out from underneath
their finger.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:58.976 --> 00:15:00.116 A:middle
out from underneath
their finger.

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:03.026 A:middle
So we can go back
over here briefly

00:15:03.026 --> 00:15:05.226 A:middle
and see how the enabled works,

00:15:05.796 --> 00:15:07.556 A:middle
and as you can see,
it's really simple.

00:15:07.936 --> 00:15:10.596 A:middle
When it's enabled, we
add all of the items back

00:15:10.596 --> 00:15:13.086 A:middle
into the behaviors, and when
it's disabled, we take them out.

00:15:13.396 --> 00:15:16.386 A:middle
It's really that easy to
create a system like this,

00:15:16.386 --> 00:15:18.526 A:middle
and you can have your own
FaceTime-like behavior

00:15:18.796 --> 00:15:19.676 A:middle
in your applications.

00:15:20.296 --> 00:15:23.006 A:middle
And so to show you how
to put that debug UI

00:15:23.186 --> 00:15:24.316 A:middle
into your own applications,

00:15:24.316 --> 00:15:25.736 A:middle
I am going to bring
Mike back up on stage.

00:15:26.516 --> 00:15:32.246 A:middle
[Applause]

00:15:32.746 --> 00:15:33.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL TURNER:
Thanks, David.

00:15:34.086 --> 00:15:37.056 A:middle
So it's really, really quite
cool, in David's example,

00:15:37.056 --> 00:15:38.786 A:middle
to visualize those field lines,

00:15:38.966 --> 00:15:41.516 A:middle
to understand what
was actually going on.

00:15:41.896 --> 00:15:43.796 A:middle
This is pretty mysterious
until he turned that on.

00:15:44.596 --> 00:15:47.956 A:middle
So those lines were basically
an overlay that shows the field

00:15:48.506 --> 00:15:50.166 A:middle
in your animators'
reference view.

00:15:51.136 --> 00:15:54.696 A:middle
And specifically, this overlay
can help you visualize fields,

00:15:54.696 --> 00:15:56.996 A:middle
collision bounds,
attachments, and whether

00:15:56.996 --> 00:16:00.106 A:middle
or not a particular item
is in motion or at rest.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:56.996 --> 00:16:00.106 A:middle
or not a particular item
is in motion or at rest.

00:16:00.656 --> 00:16:02.926 A:middle
Now, you might be wondering,
it's not going to be API.

00:16:03.866 --> 00:16:06.826 A:middle
But it will be accessible in
LLDB, and we are advertising it

00:16:06.826 --> 00:16:09.376 A:middle
as an available debug
feature on UIDynamicAnimator.

00:16:09.866 --> 00:16:10.946 A:middle
And it's really simple to use.

00:16:11.276 --> 00:16:13.256 A:middle
Just pause the debugger,
find a reference

00:16:13.256 --> 00:16:15.956 A:middle
to your dynamic animator,
set debug enabled to true,

00:16:15.956 --> 00:16:18.156 A:middle
and you will have this
great overlay depicting all

00:16:18.156 --> 00:16:18.526 A:middle
the physics.

00:16:19.516 --> 00:16:23.546 A:middle
[Applause]

00:16:24.046 --> 00:16:27.346 A:middle
Now in addition to debug
enabled and disabled,

00:16:27.346 --> 00:16:28.966 A:middle
we are also offering
debug interval.

00:16:29.056 --> 00:16:32.086 A:middle
And this is a way that you
can tune how often we update

00:16:32.086 --> 00:16:33.166 A:middle
that debug overlay.

00:16:33.456 --> 00:16:35.286 A:middle
So, by default, that
will be updated

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:37.106 A:middle
on every animation frame,
but if you have a lot

00:16:37.106 --> 00:16:39.926 A:middle
of complex physics, it might
be beneficial to change

00:16:39.926 --> 00:16:41.116 A:middle
that to five, for example,

00:16:41.116 --> 00:16:43.246 A:middle
to only update the overlay
on every fifth frame.

00:16:44.236 --> 00:16:47.326 A:middle
And, we're also allowing you
to adjust the animation speed

00:16:47.326 --> 00:16:48.236 A:middle
of the dynamic animator.

00:16:48.896 --> 00:16:51.076 A:middle
Now this might be helpful
for slowing down things

00:16:51.196 --> 00:16:52.746 A:middle
to observe what's
actually going on.

00:16:53.046 --> 00:16:55.566 A:middle
And then it's important to
keep in mind when using this,

00:16:56.126 --> 00:16:57.946 A:middle
this can affect the
results of the simulation,

00:16:58.246 --> 00:16:59.126 A:middle
when you slow things down.

00:16:59.176 --> 00:17:00.866 A:middle
So always ensure
correction at 1x.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.176 --> 00:17:00.866 A:middle
So always ensure
correction at 1x.

00:17:03.506 --> 00:17:06.215 A:middle
So, next, let's talk about
UIDynamicItemBehavior.

00:17:06.836 --> 00:17:08.195 A:middle
Now, if you recall,
this is a way

00:17:08.195 --> 00:17:11.486 A:middle
to alter the physical properties
of your view or a dynamic item,

00:17:12.046 --> 00:17:14.546 A:middle
and it can be applied to
one or more dynamic items.

00:17:15.026 --> 00:17:18.556 A:middle
And in David's example,
he applied a lower density

00:17:18.556 --> 00:17:20.656 A:middle
and a higher resistance
to the FaceTime square

00:17:20.935 --> 00:17:22.776 A:middle
to make it really stick
to the field corners.

00:17:23.516 --> 00:17:26.096 A:middle
So a few more examples of
the existing properties here.

00:17:26.096 --> 00:17:29.946 A:middle
We have elasticity, friction,
we saw density and resistance,

00:17:29.946 --> 00:17:32.066 A:middle
we have angular resistance,
and these are all great ways

00:17:32.376 --> 00:17:34.836 A:middle
to adjust how your item feels
in the animation engine.

00:17:35.536 --> 00:17:38.806 A:middle
In iOS 9, we have added two
additional properties: charge --

00:17:38.946 --> 00:17:42.066 A:middle
this affects the degree to
which your item participates

00:17:42.066 --> 00:17:44.126 A:middle
in our new electric and
magnetic field types;

00:17:44.456 --> 00:17:46.466 A:middle
and we also added an
anchored property.

00:17:47.036 --> 00:17:48.006 A:middle
This one is a little
bit different.

00:17:48.486 --> 00:17:51.096 A:middle
But what it does is it allows
your item to participate

00:17:51.096 --> 00:17:54.556 A:middle
in the dynamic system, and
participate in collisions,

00:17:54.556 --> 00:17:56.736 A:middle
but it will obtain no
velocity of its own.

00:17:56.736 --> 00:17:59.126 A:middle
So it really behaves more
like a collision boundary.

00:17:59.636 --> 00:18:03.506 A:middle
So next, I would like to talk
about UIAttachmentBehavior.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.636 --> 00:18:03.506 A:middle
So next, I would like to talk
about UIAttachmentBehavior.

00:18:03.926 --> 00:18:06.386 A:middle
And this allow you to
constrain two dynamic items

00:18:06.446 --> 00:18:08.786 A:middle
such that they maintain
a particular distance

00:18:08.786 --> 00:18:09.236 A:middle
from each other.

00:18:09.236 --> 00:18:13.066 A:middle
And you can configure this
with the damping and frequency

00:18:13.366 --> 00:18:16.136 A:middle
to make it behave more like
a spring as opposed to a rod.

00:18:16.246 --> 00:18:18.176 A:middle
And this is a great attachment.

00:18:18.176 --> 00:18:20.966 A:middle
You know, it's very useful,
but it's really only one way

00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:23.196 A:middle
to constrain two items
with respect to each other.

00:18:23.846 --> 00:18:27.686 A:middle
So, in iOS 9, we have added some
additional attachment types.

00:18:28.306 --> 00:18:29.866 A:middle
The first of which is
a limit attachment.

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:32.516 A:middle
This is quite similar to
the distance attachment

00:18:32.516 --> 00:18:35.486 A:middle
that we just described, however,
instead of being constrained

00:18:35.486 --> 00:18:37.746 A:middle
by what could be thought
of as a rod or a spring,

00:18:38.246 --> 00:18:40.816 A:middle
this one behaves more like a
rope between the two items,

00:18:40.946 --> 00:18:43.156 A:middle
where the only constraint
is a maximum distance

00:18:43.156 --> 00:18:43.616 A:middle
from each other.

00:18:44.656 --> 00:18:46.836 A:middle
And you configure this similar
to the distance attachment

00:18:47.166 --> 00:18:49.776 A:middle
by specifying two points
offset from each item's center.

00:18:50.646 --> 00:18:51.106 A:middle
Very simple.

00:18:51.996 --> 00:18:53.466 A:middle
Next, we have a fixed
attachment.

00:18:53.876 --> 00:18:56.126 A:middle
And this one is a little
bit different than the limit

00:18:56.126 --> 00:18:57.096 A:middle
or the distance attachment.

00:18:57.726 --> 00:18:59.316 A:middle
And you create this
type of attachment

00:18:59.316 --> 00:19:01.056 A:middle
by first specifying
an anchor point.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:59.316 --> 00:19:01.056 A:middle
by first specifying
an anchor point.

00:19:01.396 --> 00:19:03.336 A:middle
This anchor point is
in the coordinate space

00:19:03.336 --> 00:19:07.066 A:middle
of your reference view, with
respect to each item's center.

00:19:08.176 --> 00:19:11.156 A:middle
And this type of attachment
offers no movement whatsoever

00:19:11.196 --> 00:19:12.216 A:middle
between the two items.

00:19:12.776 --> 00:19:16.556 A:middle
It's much like a welded rod
between both items as opposed

00:19:16.556 --> 00:19:18.636 A:middle
to a rod that allows
them to spin on the ends.

00:19:19.026 --> 00:19:22.446 A:middle
And we have also added
a pin attachment type.

00:19:23.396 --> 00:19:26.026 A:middle
This one is similar to the
fixed attachment where you start

00:19:26.026 --> 00:19:28.966 A:middle
by specifying an anchor
point between two items.

00:19:29.946 --> 00:19:32.776 A:middle
But this type allows two
items to rotate with respect

00:19:32.776 --> 00:19:34.446 A:middle
to each other, about
this anchor point.

00:19:34.836 --> 00:19:37.876 A:middle
And this allows you to
specify a rotatable range,

00:19:37.936 --> 00:19:40.526 A:middle
which by default would be
unbounded but we could bound it

00:19:40.526 --> 00:19:42.406 A:middle
down to something
smaller like so.

00:19:43.436 --> 00:19:46.186 A:middle
And finally we have added
a sliding attachment.

00:19:46.786 --> 00:19:49.616 A:middle
Now the sliding attachment is
a little bit more complicated.

00:19:49.676 --> 00:19:51.066 A:middle
We'll look at an
example in just a second.

00:19:51.556 --> 00:19:53.696 A:middle
but just like the fixed
and the pin types,

00:19:53.696 --> 00:19:56.146 A:middle
we first specify this
attachment anchor point that's

00:19:56.146 --> 00:19:57.616 A:middle
in the coordinate space
of the reference view.

00:19:58.876 --> 00:20:00.396 A:middle
But unlike those
types, we also need

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:58.876 --> 00:20:00.396 A:middle
But unlike those
types, we also need

00:20:00.396 --> 00:20:02.436 A:middle
to specify an axis
of translation.

00:20:02.906 --> 00:20:04.866 A:middle
And this is where
all relative movement

00:20:04.866 --> 00:20:07.586 A:middle
between two items will be
along the axis of translation.

00:20:08.336 --> 00:20:10.516 A:middle
And this type prevents
all relative rotation

00:20:10.516 --> 00:20:11.306 A:middle
of the two items.

00:20:11.306 --> 00:20:13.666 A:middle
So they are really fixed
rotationally with respect

00:20:13.666 --> 00:20:15.946 A:middle
to each other and they can
only move along the axis

00:20:15.946 --> 00:20:16.566 A:middle
of translation.

00:20:17.826 --> 00:20:18.836 A:middle
But just like the pin type,

00:20:19.196 --> 00:20:21.126 A:middle
you can limit this
translatable range.

00:20:21.286 --> 00:20:23.106 A:middle
So if you do specify
a translatable range,

00:20:23.426 --> 00:20:25.556 A:middle
it needs to include the
attachment anchor point,

00:20:26.096 --> 00:20:27.566 A:middle
where the anchor
point is defined

00:20:27.566 --> 00:20:29.166 A:middle
as the point zero in the range.

00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:32.126 A:middle
So if we set this system up
with this type of attachment,

00:20:32.806 --> 00:20:34.026 A:middle
we can have linear motion

00:20:34.026 --> 00:20:35.566 A:middle
between the two items,
like that.

00:20:36.456 --> 00:20:37.516 A:middle
So that's pretty complicated.

00:20:37.516 --> 00:20:38.896 A:middle
Let's look at a basic example.

00:20:39.926 --> 00:20:41.376 A:middle
And to do that, I want to return

00:20:41.376 --> 00:20:43.256 A:middle
to our sliding example
one more time.

00:20:44.476 --> 00:20:46.666 A:middle
Now, I mentioned in the
past, that had we tried

00:20:46.706 --> 00:20:49.666 A:middle
to make this slidable
behavior, we would have had

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:51.996 A:middle
to add a collision on the
bottom and on each side

00:20:52.066 --> 00:20:53.886 A:middle
and somewhere off the
screen above on the top,

00:20:54.186 --> 00:20:55.206 A:middle
to constrain the motion

00:20:55.446 --> 00:20:57.426 A:middle
of the sliding view
along the vertical axis.

00:20:58.036 --> 00:21:00.366 A:middle
Well, with UI attachment
behavior, we don't need to do

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:58.036 --> 00:21:00.366 A:middle
Well, with UI attachment
behavior, we don't need to do

00:21:00.366 --> 00:21:02.776 A:middle
that anymore, we can use a
sliding attachment to do that.

00:21:03.026 --> 00:21:04.786 A:middle
So we limit the system
to one collision,

00:21:05.176 --> 00:21:06.176 A:middle
making the performance better,

00:21:06.436 --> 00:21:08.126 A:middle
and the code actually
quite a bit more readable.

00:21:08.916 --> 00:21:10.546 A:middle
So if we enable our
debug view here,

00:21:10.956 --> 00:21:13.366 A:middle
you can see the sliding
attachment depicted

00:21:13.366 --> 00:21:15.426 A:middle
by the straight line
along the vertical axis.

00:21:15.426 --> 00:21:18.406 A:middle
It expands and contracts
as we slide the view,

00:21:18.876 --> 00:21:20.476 A:middle
but there's also
another attachment there,

00:21:20.846 --> 00:21:23.776 A:middle
and that's a distance
attachment that we use to attach

00:21:23.776 --> 00:21:25.636 A:middle
to an anchor point
that's manipulated

00:21:25.636 --> 00:21:26.826 A:middle
by a pan gesture recognizer.

00:21:27.306 --> 00:21:29.636 A:middle
So, unlike David's demo,
this one's entirely

00:21:29.636 --> 00:21:30.706 A:middle
within the dynamics system.

00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:32.646 A:middle
We don't disable
or enable anything.

00:21:32.826 --> 00:21:33.776 A:middle
We just stay in dynamics.

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:34.746 A:middle
Pretty cool.

00:21:35.836 --> 00:21:39.086 A:middle
So, finally, let me give you a
quick update on UISnapBehavior.

00:21:39.786 --> 00:21:42.356 A:middle
If you recall, UISnapBehavior
is a higher level behavior.

00:21:42.796 --> 00:21:45.426 A:middle
And it can be used to move
a view from one location

00:21:45.426 --> 00:21:46.896 A:middle
to another with a
snap-like effect.

00:21:47.956 --> 00:21:50.296 A:middle
And SnapBehavior allows you
to customize the damping

00:21:50.296 --> 00:21:53.196 A:middle
of the snap, which can
really adjust, you know,

00:21:53.196 --> 00:21:54.816 A:middle
the snappiness of how it feels.

00:21:55.616 --> 00:21:58.096 A:middle
In iOS 9, we've added
the ability

00:21:58.096 --> 00:22:00.296 A:middle
to customize the snap
point after init time

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.096 --> 00:22:00.296 A:middle
to customize the snap
point after init time

00:22:00.296 --> 00:22:01.816 A:middle
as well, which is pretty cool.

00:22:02.076 --> 00:22:03.366 A:middle
So let's look at a
quick example, here.

00:22:04.006 --> 00:22:08.246 A:middle
So if we try to pan the view,
here, with our debug on,

00:22:08.616 --> 00:22:11.586 A:middle
it will fall back to the screen,
like the original snap point.

00:22:12.016 --> 00:22:14.596 A:middle
If we tap in another location,
it will snap to the new point

00:22:14.686 --> 00:22:16.196 A:middle
and that's just adjusting
the snap point

00:22:16.516 --> 00:22:18.106 A:middle
on an existing dynamic behavior.

00:22:18.486 --> 00:22:18.896 A:middle
Pretty cool.

00:22:19.626 --> 00:22:22.976 A:middle
And you will also notice
that with the debug overlay,

00:22:23.546 --> 00:22:25.706 A:middle
this is actually a
composite behavior of its own.

00:22:25.706 --> 00:22:29.086 A:middle
There's four attachments
here, configured as springs,

00:22:29.516 --> 00:22:31.956 A:middle
just that snap the view
to the new position.

00:22:31.956 --> 00:22:32.746 A:middle
It's really quite cool.

00:22:33.546 --> 00:22:36.626 A:middle
So that's what's new in
UIKit Dynamics and iOS 9.

00:22:37.406 --> 00:22:38.816 A:middle
I would like to turn
it over to David

00:22:38.816 --> 00:22:39.936 A:middle
to talk about visual effects.

00:22:41.516 --> 00:22:45.996 A:middle
[Applause]

00:22:46.496 --> 00:22:47.266 A:middle
&gt;&gt; DAVID DUNCAN: Good
evening, everybody.

00:22:47.266 --> 00:22:49.936 A:middle
So we are going to talk
about using visual effects

00:22:49.936 --> 00:22:51.456 A:middle
to add style to your
application.

00:22:52.256 --> 00:22:54.136 A:middle
So we are going to motivate this

00:22:54.136 --> 00:22:57.006 A:middle
with just a simple image viewer
application, where what we want

00:22:57.006 --> 00:23:00.256 A:middle
to do is show the user
some extra information

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:57.006 --> 00:23:00.256 A:middle
to do is show the user
some extra information

00:23:00.256 --> 00:23:01.756 A:middle
about the photo they are
currently looking at.

00:23:02.316 --> 00:23:05.596 A:middle
And so as you see right
there, this image happens

00:23:05.596 --> 00:23:06.606 A:middle
to have a little overlay

00:23:06.606 --> 00:23:09.126 A:middle
that tells us what the
file name is of the image.

00:23:09.676 --> 00:23:11.896 A:middle
So we are going to walk through
how we actually create that.

00:23:13.176 --> 00:23:15.306 A:middle
And so, the first
step is that you need

00:23:15.306 --> 00:23:16.336 A:middle
to create a blur effect.

00:23:16.866 --> 00:23:19.206 A:middle
And we have three different
styles, the extra light,

00:23:19.286 --> 00:23:20.456 A:middle
light, and dark styles.

00:23:20.946 --> 00:23:25.156 A:middle
And then you create a blur
effect from those styles.

00:23:25.566 --> 00:23:27.356 A:middle
And that's just how you
do that right there.

00:23:27.896 --> 00:23:30.446 A:middle
And finally, you create
your visual effect view

00:23:30.626 --> 00:23:31.696 A:middle
with that blur style.

00:23:32.306 --> 00:23:34.256 A:middle
Then you just add whatever
layout you need to do

00:23:34.546 --> 00:23:36.406 A:middle
and you can get the blur
that you see on screen there.

00:23:36.406 --> 00:23:39.886 A:middle
The next step is we are going
to add a vibrancy effect.

00:23:39.886 --> 00:23:42.596 A:middle
And what vibrancy does is, it
really makes something pop,

00:23:42.596 --> 00:23:44.286 A:middle
stand out from when
it's over a blur.

00:23:44.286 --> 00:23:47.986 A:middle
And so what we are going to do
is we are just going to create

00:23:47.986 --> 00:23:49.766 A:middle
that vibrancy effect
from a blur effect.

00:23:49.926 --> 00:23:51.776 A:middle
As mentioned, it's really
intended to be overlayed

00:23:51.776 --> 00:23:54.316 A:middle
from a blur, so we start
with that blur effect

00:23:54.316 --> 00:23:55.526 A:middle
to create the vibrancy effect.

00:23:56.616 --> 00:23:57.966 A:middle
We create our vibrancy effect,

00:23:57.966 --> 00:23:59.166 A:middle
just like we did
before with the blur.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:00.026 --> 00:24:01.806 A:middle
And then, in this case
we're going to add it

00:24:01.806 --> 00:24:04.336 A:middle
to the content view
of the blur view.

00:24:04.336 --> 00:24:07.226 A:middle
Now, it doesn't have to be
directly added to the blur,

00:24:07.226 --> 00:24:10.406 A:middle
but there should be a
blur that you see behind

00:24:10.466 --> 00:24:11.356 A:middle
that visual effect view.

00:24:12.416 --> 00:24:14.356 A:middle
And finally, we add the label

00:24:14.356 --> 00:24:16.226 A:middle
to the content view
of the vibrancy view.

00:24:16.416 --> 00:24:19.396 A:middle
And the reason we are adding
these things to the content view

00:24:19.396 --> 00:24:21.356 A:middle
of the visual effects view,
is because that ensures

00:24:21.356 --> 00:24:23.856 A:middle
that we get the correct
effect for all the content

00:24:23.856 --> 00:24:24.696 A:middle
that you are presenting.

00:24:25.216 --> 00:24:27.436 A:middle
And so, when you have
done all of that,

00:24:27.916 --> 00:24:30.316 A:middle
you get the lovely
label on top of the blur

00:24:30.406 --> 00:24:31.226 A:middle
as you see on the screen.

00:24:32.406 --> 00:24:33.906 A:middle
So what's new in iOS 9 here?

00:24:34.526 --> 00:24:37.146 A:middle
Well, the first thing we have
done is we have made it really

00:24:37.146 --> 00:24:40.446 A:middle
easy to cleanly animate
the bounds of your view.

00:24:40.446 --> 00:24:42.836 A:middle
So that you can show more
information in that blur view

00:24:42.836 --> 00:24:45.916 A:middle
to the user without having to
do anything really complex.

00:24:46.876 --> 00:24:48.746 A:middle
But, in addition, we
have made it possible

00:24:48.746 --> 00:24:51.986 A:middle
for you to animate the blur.

00:24:52.136 --> 00:24:54.796 A:middle
And so now, if you have a night
load in your app, for example,

00:24:54.796 --> 00:24:56.996 A:middle
you can do a really clean
animation from day to night

00:24:56.996 --> 00:24:58.966 A:middle
in your application and
move the user along.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:00.276 --> 00:25:02.176 A:middle
Now, the next thing we are
going to talk through, briefly,

00:25:02.176 --> 00:25:04.966 A:middle
is how do we actually get
these effects to the screen?

00:25:05.076 --> 00:25:08.086 A:middle
What does it do and why
do you need to know?

00:25:08.086 --> 00:25:09.906 A:middle
It's important because
this all has impacts

00:25:09.906 --> 00:25:11.426 A:middle
on both performance
and correctness.

00:25:11.426 --> 00:25:13.936 A:middle
So little baby Sophia
here is going to walk us

00:25:13.936 --> 00:25:18.316 A:middle
through adding a little
overlay to her little UI here.

00:25:19.246 --> 00:25:20.906 A:middle
So the first thing
to do is figure out,

00:25:20.906 --> 00:25:21.836 A:middle
where are we capturing?

00:25:22.496 --> 00:25:23.946 A:middle
Whenever we see a visual effect,

00:25:24.016 --> 00:25:26.426 A:middle
we figure out what the capture
content we need for it is

00:25:26.866 --> 00:25:27.906 A:middle
and we move it offscreen.

00:25:28.726 --> 00:25:30.026 A:middle
So we copy that little
piece out.

00:25:30.966 --> 00:25:33.306 A:middle
And now that it's offscreen,
we can actually work with it,

00:25:33.306 --> 00:25:34.636 A:middle
but why did we take
it offscreen?

00:25:35.116 --> 00:25:37.536 A:middle
Well, for one reason is
that we need to make sure

00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:39.196 A:middle
that we get the correct
effects and in this case

00:25:39.196 --> 00:25:41.216 A:middle
that we capture everything
we need to blur

00:25:41.216 --> 00:25:44.156 A:middle
for that blur effect, but
also we often do these things

00:25:44.156 --> 00:25:46.616 A:middle
offscreen so that we don't mess
up the content that's already

00:25:46.646 --> 00:25:48.556 A:middle
on screen when we are
doing effects like this.

00:25:49.776 --> 00:25:50.976 A:middle
So we apply the blur to it.

00:25:52.406 --> 00:25:54.636 A:middle
And finally we copy
it back into position

00:25:54.636 --> 00:25:55.846 A:middle
where the effect
view desired it,

00:25:56.836 --> 00:25:58.896 A:middle
and all of this is
the definition

00:25:58.896 --> 00:26:00.506 A:middle
of something you might
have heard before called an

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:58.896 --> 00:26:00.506 A:middle
of something you might
have heard before called an

00:26:00.506 --> 00:26:01.936 A:middle
offscreen pass.

00:26:02.006 --> 00:26:05.456 A:middle
It's whenever we take content,
we copy it into an offscreen,

00:26:05.876 --> 00:26:07.826 A:middle
do work, and then bring
it back on screen.

00:26:09.326 --> 00:26:12.376 A:middle
So what are some other ways that
we can get offscreen passes?

00:26:12.866 --> 00:26:15.266 A:middle
Well, as you can see,
we have got alpha,

00:26:15.546 --> 00:26:17.376 A:middle
and you can see the
way you do that because

00:26:17.376 --> 00:26:19.916 A:middle
if you have a complex view
hierarchy that needs alpha

00:26:19.916 --> 00:26:23.286 A:middle
in it, then we can't just apply
the alpha to individual views,

00:26:23.286 --> 00:26:24.556 A:middle
because you won't get
the correct effect.

00:26:25.166 --> 00:26:28.186 A:middle
Instead we need to take the
entire complex hierarchy

00:26:28.236 --> 00:26:30.806 A:middle
offscreen, render it,
and then apply the alpha

00:26:30.806 --> 00:26:31.406 A:middle
to the whole thing.

00:26:32.026 --> 00:26:34.346 A:middle
Masking has a very similar
reasoning behind it,

00:26:34.346 --> 00:26:38.986 A:middle
in that we need to have all
the pixels for the mask.

00:26:39.166 --> 00:26:42.326 A:middle
As we just mentioned, blur and
vibrancy also go offscreen,

00:26:43.296 --> 00:26:44.926 A:middle
but snapshotting,
why is that up there?

00:26:44.926 --> 00:26:45.806 A:middle
You might ask yourself.

00:26:46.566 --> 00:26:48.206 A:middle
Well, first off,
what is snapshotting?

00:26:48.506 --> 00:26:51.416 A:middle
We have got these two UIView
methods, snapshot view

00:26:51.416 --> 00:26:53.616 A:middle
after screen updates and draw
view hierarchy in rect and

00:26:54.166 --> 00:26:57.136 A:middle
and the UIScreen method snapshot
view after screen updates,

00:26:57.656 --> 00:27:00.636 A:middle
and these all hand you back
content from a snapshot.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:57.656 --> 00:27:00.636 A:middle
and these all hand you back
content from a snapshot.

00:27:01.306 --> 00:27:03.936 A:middle
Well, a snapshot is
basically doing the same thing

00:27:03.936 --> 00:27:07.026 A:middle
as an offscreen pass but giving
you control over the final step

00:27:07.026 --> 00:27:08.196 A:middle
of copying it back to screen.

00:27:09.246 --> 00:27:11.846 A:middle
We take all content that
you asked us to snapshot,

00:27:11.966 --> 00:27:14.346 A:middle
render it offscreen, and
then hand you back a view

00:27:14.346 --> 00:27:17.266 A:middle
or pixel content
representing that image.

00:27:18.656 --> 00:27:21.056 A:middle
But, again, what does this
have to do with making sure

00:27:21.056 --> 00:27:22.856 A:middle
that your effects are correct.?

00:27:22.856 --> 00:27:27.186 A:middle
Well, unfortunately, if you get
a visual effect caught in all

00:27:27.186 --> 00:27:29.656 A:middle
of this, as you can see,
Sophia has lost her blur.

00:27:30.036 --> 00:27:33.306 A:middle
And that's what you will see on
screen if a visual effect ends

00:27:33.306 --> 00:27:34.836 A:middle
up getting caught
in an offscreen

00:27:34.836 --> 00:27:38.866 A:middle
that you didn't expect
it to go into.

00:27:38.866 --> 00:27:41.606 A:middle
So back to motivating this,
I'm sure you have all been

00:27:41.606 --> 00:27:43.686 A:middle
to the multitasking sessions
this year, and if not,

00:27:43.686 --> 00:27:45.186 A:middle
you should watch them
on video afterwards.

00:27:45.606 --> 00:27:47.056 A:middle
But one the key things
that you need

00:27:47.056 --> 00:27:48.616 A:middle
to have a great app
participating

00:27:48.616 --> 00:27:51.146 A:middle
in multitasking is good
performance on screen.

00:27:51.406 --> 00:27:52.536 A:middle
Because now the performance

00:27:52.536 --> 00:27:54.346 A:middle
of your app also affects
the other side app.

00:27:55.066 --> 00:27:56.866 A:middle
And so, since we don't
have any scrolling

00:27:56.866 --> 00:27:59.576 A:middle
in this particular example,
we have decided, let's instead

00:27:59.576 --> 00:28:01.106 A:middle
of keeping the blur
rendering all the time,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.576 --> 00:28:01.106 A:middle
of keeping the blur
rendering all the time,

00:28:01.106 --> 00:28:02.896 A:middle
let's just take a
snapshot of it.

00:28:02.896 --> 00:28:04.616 A:middle
And so we decided
to take a snapshot

00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:06.266 A:middle
of that particular
visual effect view.

00:28:07.526 --> 00:28:10.656 A:middle
But then what happens
is the capture area is

00:28:10.656 --> 00:28:11.666 A:middle
happening offscreen.

00:28:12.086 --> 00:28:14.546 A:middle
And since you only snapshotted
the visual effect view,

00:28:15.526 --> 00:28:17.216 A:middle
there's nothing in
that capture area.

00:28:17.896 --> 00:28:19.496 A:middle
And so the capture
gives you back nothing,

00:28:19.616 --> 00:28:20.836 A:middle
and the blur has
nothing to blur,

00:28:21.136 --> 00:28:22.806 A:middle
and you get the broken
effect you saw before.

00:28:23.776 --> 00:28:27.396 A:middle
So, now that we have seen how
you can have your effect broken,

00:28:27.626 --> 00:28:28.506 A:middle
what can we do to fix it?

00:28:29.276 --> 00:28:32.346 A:middle
Well, first thing is, we
have this handy method

00:28:32.536 --> 00:28:35.156 A:middle
on visual effect view, called,
what's wrong with this effect?

00:28:36.016 --> 00:28:38.016 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:28:38.016 --> 00:28:43.000 A:middle
[Applause]

00:28:43.396 --> 00:28:46.916 A:middle
Just like with the dynamics
debugging flags this isn't

00:28:46.916 --> 00:28:50.136 A:middle
available in the SDK as
such, but you can call it

00:28:50.136 --> 00:28:51.766 A:middle
from in the debugger,
just like this,

00:28:52.446 --> 00:28:55.746 A:middle
and you will get back a string
that looks kind of like this.

00:28:56.286 --> 00:28:58.936 A:middle
In this case, we found that
there was a mask view somewhere

00:28:58.936 --> 00:29:01.686 A:middle
up in the hierarchy that was
causing the visual effect

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.936 --> 00:29:01.686 A:middle
up in the hierarchy that was
causing the visual effect

00:29:01.716 --> 00:29:04.566 A:middle
to go offscreen, and thus
not capture as much content

00:29:04.566 --> 00:29:06.286 A:middle
as it needed to,
to render properly.

00:29:06.846 --> 00:29:09.986 A:middle
So how can you fix this?

00:29:10.746 --> 00:29:13.036 A:middle
First way that this works,
if you are using either alpha

00:29:13.036 --> 00:29:15.076 A:middle
or masking, is to rearrange
your view hierarchy.

00:29:15.076 --> 00:29:18.806 A:middle
What we have here is just some
container, maybe the window,

00:29:19.036 --> 00:29:20.016 A:middle
and a container view

00:29:20.016 --> 00:29:22.146 A:middle
that contains a blur
and further contents.

00:29:22.576 --> 00:29:24.686 A:middle
Well, in this case the
blur doesn't actually need

00:29:24.686 --> 00:29:26.736 A:middle
to participate in the
alpha or masking we have,

00:29:27.496 --> 00:29:30.626 A:middle
so we just rearrange to have
the blur as the first subview,

00:29:30.776 --> 00:29:33.346 A:middle
the container as the second
subview, and thus the container

00:29:33.346 --> 00:29:35.606 A:middle
and everything in it will
render on top of the blur,

00:29:35.906 --> 00:29:38.276 A:middle
and we can apply alpha or
masking to the container view

00:29:38.446 --> 00:29:39.496 A:middle
without messing up our blur.

00:29:40.936 --> 00:29:43.666 A:middle
A second thing that we
can do for masking is,

00:29:43.956 --> 00:29:47.856 A:middle
instead of masking the container
view, we can move that mask

00:29:48.036 --> 00:29:51.086 A:middle
down into the content that
we actually need masking for.

00:29:51.966 --> 00:29:53.166 A:middle
Now, as we mentioned before,

00:29:53.166 --> 00:29:55.006 A:middle
masking will often
take an offscreen pass,

00:29:55.206 --> 00:29:56.756 A:middle
so you should be very
careful about performance

00:29:56.756 --> 00:30:00.066 A:middle
when do a transformation
like this.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:56.756 --> 00:30:00.066 A:middle
when do a transformation
like this.

00:30:00.656 --> 00:30:02.816 A:middle
Finally, with snapshotting,
as we mentioned before,

00:30:02.816 --> 00:30:05.086 A:middle
snapshotting is only going to
capture what you tell it to.

00:30:05.666 --> 00:30:07.976 A:middle
So, in this case, that
content view that we are asking

00:30:07.976 --> 00:30:10.216 A:middle
to snapshot has transparency
in it.

00:30:10.216 --> 00:30:11.526 A:middle
So we can see things behind it.

00:30:11.746 --> 00:30:14.066 A:middle
But if we snapshot just that
view, we aren't going to get

00:30:14.066 --> 00:30:15.886 A:middle
that in the blur and it is
going to look a little funny.

00:30:16.536 --> 00:30:17.766 A:middle
So if we move the snapshot up,

00:30:17.766 --> 00:30:20.636 A:middle
all the way to the window is
usually the easiest thing to do,

00:30:21.206 --> 00:30:22.086 A:middle
but sometimes you might need

00:30:22.086 --> 00:30:23.346 A:middle
to move it all the
way up to the screen.

00:30:23.916 --> 00:30:26.066 A:middle
So if you are going to snapshot
blurs, you should make sure

00:30:26.066 --> 00:30:28.506 A:middle
that you snapshot as far
away from the blur content

00:30:28.506 --> 00:30:30.656 A:middle
as possible so that you are
sure you get everything you need

00:30:30.656 --> 00:30:31.606 A:middle
for it.

00:30:32.266 --> 00:30:36.006 A:middle
And so with that, let's switch
over to some best practices

00:30:36.006 --> 00:30:37.386 A:middle
with dynamics and AutoLayout.

00:30:41.016 --> 00:30:44.816 A:middle
So, the first thing you might do
is you might have fairly complex

00:30:44.816 --> 00:30:46.846 A:middle
view hierarchies working
inside of dynamics.

00:30:47.926 --> 00:30:50.226 A:middle
And what you want is for the
outer view to participate

00:30:50.226 --> 00:30:52.716 A:middle
in the dynamic system
but not the inner views.

00:30:52.766 --> 00:30:53.866 A:middle
They are just going to be laid

00:30:53.866 --> 00:30:55.806 A:middle
out like you would
with any other thing.

00:30:56.056 --> 00:30:59.746 A:middle
So you can use UIKit
Dynamics for the outside view,

00:30:59.946 --> 00:31:02.536 A:middle
just by turning translate
auto resizing mask

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.946 --> 00:31:02.536 A:middle
just by turning translate
auto resizing mask

00:31:02.536 --> 00:31:03.936 A:middle
into constraints to true.

00:31:04.096 --> 00:31:06.356 A:middle
And, yes, in the only slide
at WWDC that says true.

00:31:07.586 --> 00:31:10.816 A:middle
And then you can use AutoLayout

00:31:10.816 --> 00:31:12.586 A:middle
to just position
everything else inside,

00:31:12.586 --> 00:31:14.756 A:middle
just like you always have,
or using the new syntax

00:31:14.756 --> 00:31:17.226 A:middle
as shown on the slide.

00:31:17.406 --> 00:31:20.326 A:middle
Another thing you can do is,
often you will have items

00:31:20.326 --> 00:31:23.486 A:middle
in the dynamic system but you
might have labels for them

00:31:23.536 --> 00:31:25.806 A:middle
that shouldn't participate,
but they need to follow.

00:31:26.256 --> 00:31:28.516 A:middle
And so Lola here
has her little tag

00:31:28.866 --> 00:31:31.526 A:middle
that says what the file name
is, and we just have this anchor

00:31:31.526 --> 00:31:33.416 A:middle
that represents our
AutoLayout constraints,

00:31:33.786 --> 00:31:36.816 A:middle
and then when dynamics comes in
and wants to move Lola around,

00:31:37.026 --> 00:31:39.586 A:middle
the label moves with it,
but the label does not end

00:31:39.586 --> 00:31:40.996 A:middle
up interacting with dynamics.

00:31:42.656 --> 00:31:45.506 A:middle
Finally you can work
with dynamics

00:31:45.536 --> 00:31:47.316 A:middle
by creating a custom
dynamic item,

00:31:47.436 --> 00:31:48.676 A:middle
just as Mike mentioned earlier.

00:31:49.846 --> 00:31:51.216 A:middle
You just subclass NSObject

00:31:51.216 --> 00:31:53.576 A:middle
or some other appropriate
object class,

00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:57.096 A:middle
conform to the UI
Dynamic Item protocol

00:31:58.136 --> 00:31:59.756 A:middle
and provide the required
methods.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:00.666 --> 00:32:02.036 A:middle
A bounds some of size --

00:32:02.156 --> 00:32:04.126 A:middle
it can't be 00, or the
dynamic system is going

00:32:04.126 --> 00:32:08.246 A:middle
to throw an exception -- and you
implement center and transform,

00:32:08.376 --> 00:32:10.826 A:middle
and you use the values
of those in order

00:32:10.826 --> 00:32:13.016 A:middle
to construct AutoLayout
constraints

00:32:13.226 --> 00:32:15.326 A:middle
or otherwise change something
outside of your system.

00:32:16.466 --> 00:32:20.216 A:middle
And so to close out, we are
going to show you a demo

00:32:20.736 --> 00:32:25.436 A:middle
of how you can do just that.

00:32:25.806 --> 00:32:29.786 A:middle
So what we have got here, is,
again, a simple application

00:32:30.266 --> 00:32:31.666 A:middle
that just shows a photo.

00:32:31.666 --> 00:32:34.116 A:middle
But we want to be able to
show the user the faces

00:32:34.116 --> 00:32:35.776 A:middle
in the photo with some style.

00:32:36.056 --> 00:32:40.076 A:middle
And so when we click our dynamic
item system stretches out

00:32:40.076 --> 00:32:41.386 A:middle
and animates in that blur.

00:32:42.126 --> 00:32:43.896 A:middle
And if you click again,
of course, it will move

00:32:43.896 --> 00:32:45.446 A:middle
out with a nice little effect.

00:32:46.426 --> 00:32:49.106 A:middle
But if you keep clicking,
then you can see

00:32:49.106 --> 00:32:51.636 A:middle
that it responds very
fluidly to the dynamic system

00:32:52.146 --> 00:32:54.746 A:middle
and doesn't have
very set, rigid path.

00:32:55.466 --> 00:32:58.886 A:middle
So it's very reactive to
exactly what the user is doing.

00:32:59.726 --> 00:33:01.066 A:middle
So how do we get that to work?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:59.726 --> 00:33:01.066 A:middle
So how do we get that to work?

00:33:01.966 --> 00:33:05.496 A:middle
So, the first thing we do is
we have this face layout guide,

00:33:06.006 --> 00:33:07.996 A:middle
and that's just a subclass
of UI layout guide,

00:33:08.296 --> 00:33:11.396 A:middle
and inside of it is a
little bit of dynamics.

00:33:11.836 --> 00:33:14.626 A:middle
We have this face layout guide
dynamic item, that, again,

00:33:14.626 --> 00:33:17.436 A:middle
subclass as NSObject and
conforms to UI Dynamic Item,

00:33:18.256 --> 00:33:19.896 A:middle
and it's going to
manage a constraint,

00:33:20.306 --> 00:33:24.116 A:middle
and by setting the constant of
that constraint to either the x

00:33:24.116 --> 00:33:27.396 A:middle
or y value of the center
point, whenever that changes.

00:33:27.916 --> 00:33:33.676 A:middle
And then in here, when you
set up the layout guide,

00:33:34.016 --> 00:33:35.586 A:middle
it's got a centerrable position

00:33:35.836 --> 00:33:38.376 A:middle
and it creates four
additional dynamic items

00:33:38.646 --> 00:33:40.416 A:middle
that represent the
top, left, bottom,

00:33:40.416 --> 00:33:41.956 A:middle
and right in that system.

00:33:43.146 --> 00:33:45.256 A:middle
We assign it the constraints
and the constraints just work

00:33:45.336 --> 00:33:47.856 A:middle
from the top left corner
of the dynamic item,

00:33:48.496 --> 00:33:50.586 A:middle
of the dynamic item
reference view,

00:33:51.576 --> 00:33:54.146 A:middle
and we use slider
attachments to limit

00:33:54.146 --> 00:33:56.186 A:middle
where those four
dynamic items can go

00:33:56.186 --> 00:33:57.226 A:middle
with respect to the position.

00:33:57.626 --> 00:34:00.036 A:middle
And this keeps it from
flying outside of the system

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:57.626 --> 00:34:00.036 A:middle
And this keeps it from
flying outside of the system

00:34:00.036 --> 00:34:01.986 A:middle
or collapsing to too
small of a position.

00:34:01.986 --> 00:34:05.096 A:middle
Now, in the view controller,

00:34:05.096 --> 00:34:08.065 A:middle
the way we get this behavior is
we have a gravity behavior along

00:34:08.065 --> 00:34:09.096 A:middle
with the face layout guide,

00:34:09.406 --> 00:34:10.896 A:middle
and we center them
on top of each other.

00:34:10.896 --> 00:34:12.406 A:middle
So when the gravity changes,

00:34:12.406 --> 00:34:13.966 A:middle
the layout guide will
move appropriately,

00:34:15.176 --> 00:34:17.156 A:middle
and we get the blur
effect from our storyboard,

00:34:17.156 --> 00:34:18.866 A:middle
so that we don't have to
constantly twiddle with it

00:34:18.866 --> 00:34:21.196 A:middle
if we decide we want to
change the style we are using.

00:34:21.766 --> 00:34:26.085 A:middle
And we use constraints
to attach that blur view

00:34:26.356 --> 00:34:27.576 A:middle
to the face layout guide.

00:34:27.886 --> 00:34:29.795 A:middle
So that when that
guide changes size,

00:34:29.886 --> 00:34:31.545 A:middle
the blur view will
also change with it.

00:34:33.005 --> 00:34:35.916 A:middle
Now, in order to make it look
like the blur view is cutting

00:34:35.916 --> 00:34:38.416 A:middle
out everything but the faces,
we actually have a little trick.

00:34:38.666 --> 00:34:40.815 A:middle
We make imposters from
the original image,

00:34:40.976 --> 00:34:44.295 A:middle
just cut out the images that
we want, apply a mask to them,

00:34:44.606 --> 00:34:47.815 A:middle
and create additional UI
Image Views to place on top

00:34:47.815 --> 00:34:48.806 A:middle
of the one that's already there.

00:34:49.456 --> 00:34:52.156 A:middle
And so it looks like the blur
is just dodging the faces

00:34:52.156 --> 00:34:54.246 A:middle
but what is actually happening
is you're seeing the views

00:34:54.246 --> 00:34:58.306 A:middle
that were placed on top that
have the faces cut out on them.

00:34:58.496 --> 00:35:01.176 A:middle
Finally, we have this tap
gesture recognizer that we set,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:58.496 --> 00:35:01.176 A:middle
Finally, we have this tap
gesture recognizer that we set,

00:35:01.176 --> 00:35:02.336 A:middle
and it will be the thing

00:35:02.336 --> 00:35:04.446 A:middle
that causes our dynamic
system to change.

00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:08.036 A:middle
When we want to expose
the faces,

00:35:08.506 --> 00:35:09.506 A:middle
we just change the gravity.

00:35:09.916 --> 00:35:12.126 A:middle
So normally the gravity is
causing everything to be pulled

00:35:12.126 --> 00:35:14.346 A:middle
into the center, but
then when we flip it,

00:35:14.346 --> 00:35:16.646 A:middle
it wants to push everything
out like a repulsor.

00:35:17.966 --> 00:35:19.696 A:middle
And then we take
advantage of the fact

00:35:19.696 --> 00:35:21.826 A:middle
that we are always laying
out subviews during this,

00:35:22.206 --> 00:35:24.766 A:middle
to actually trigger the
blur animation in or out.

00:35:25.696 --> 00:35:29.066 A:middle
And that's all it takes in order
to build this really nice effect

00:35:29.416 --> 00:35:31.316 A:middle
from something that
both autolayout

00:35:31.316 --> 00:35:33.256 A:middle
and dynamics can both
provide easily for you.

00:35:33.256 --> 00:35:38.666 A:middle
And so we will go back
to slides to finish out.

00:35:39.466 --> 00:35:43.376 A:middle
So in summary, we want you
to use these technologies

00:35:43.376 --> 00:35:45.256 A:middle
to really improve
the user experience.

00:35:45.506 --> 00:35:48.036 A:middle
So when you add a
blur, you add it

00:35:48.036 --> 00:35:50.966 A:middle
so that you can put
additional information offset

00:35:51.026 --> 00:35:51.856 A:middle
from your content.

00:35:52.346 --> 00:35:53.666 A:middle
When you use dynamics, it's

00:35:53.666 --> 00:35:57.056 A:middle
so that you can have a user
interface that responds nicely

00:35:57.056 --> 00:35:59.126 A:middle
and as the user expects
to their input.

00:36:00.016 --> 00:36:01.606 A:middle
But you also want to
consider performance

00:36:01.606 --> 00:36:02.596 A:middle
when you are doing these things.

00:36:03.026 --> 00:36:05.366 A:middle
Because if you have a lot
of dynamic items on screen,

00:36:05.536 --> 00:36:07.406 A:middle
that can really bog
down the user interface,

00:36:07.866 --> 00:36:10.196 A:middle
and you don't get the nice
physics that you were expecting.

00:36:10.536 --> 00:36:11.876 A:middle
So use it with caution.

00:36:12.306 --> 00:36:15.536 A:middle
But also for visual effects,
if you have a lot of them,

00:36:15.536 --> 00:36:17.426 A:middle
you will end up with
lots of offscreen passes

00:36:17.756 --> 00:36:19.436 A:middle
and that can incur
quite a cost as well.

00:36:21.456 --> 00:36:23.156 A:middle
So these are all
the related sessions

00:36:23.156 --> 00:36:24.186 A:middle
that we have got for you today.

00:36:24.186 --> 00:36:26.856 A:middle
Unfortunately most of
them have occurred before.

00:36:26.856 --> 00:36:29.566 A:middle
There's only one that hasn't
and that's occurring with us,

00:36:29.566 --> 00:36:31.366 A:middle
called "Building Responsive
and Efficient Apps with GCD."

00:36:31.366 --> 00:36:34.996 A:middle
And we will be in the lab
after this to take all

00:36:34.996 --> 00:36:37.106 A:middle
of your questions and
help you get the most

00:36:37.106 --> 00:36:38.616 A:middle
out of what you have
got for this year.

00:36:39.176 --> 00:36:43.646 A:middle
We have got various
documentation, and assemble code

00:36:43.646 --> 00:36:45.416 A:middle
for the StickyCorners
sample that you saw earlier

00:36:45.416 --> 00:36:48.346 A:middle
in the presentation should be up
and available, and, of course,

00:36:48.346 --> 00:36:50.596 A:middle
Curt Rothert to take your
questions through email.

00:36:51.106 --> 00:36:53.566 A:middle
And I'm glad you stuck
with us on Friday.

00:36:53.886 --> 00:36:56.486 A:middle
I hope you had a great
WWDC and a safe trip home.

00:36:57.016 --> 00:36:59.000 A:middle
[Applause]
