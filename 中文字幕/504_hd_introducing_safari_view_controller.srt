00:00:29.046 --> 00:00:29.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; RICK: 大家下午好.

00:00:30.456 --> 00:00:33.106 A:middle
欢迎各位. 在我们开始前我想稍微

00:00:33.106 --> 00:00:34.966 A:middle
调查一下童鞋们的情况.

00:00:35.136 --> 00:00:36.036 A:middle
只需各位举举手即可.

00:00:36.716 --> 00:00:37.796 A:middle
如果已经有在App商店

00:00:37.796 --> 00:00:39.986 A:middle
上架应用的童鞋, 

00:00:39.986 --> 00:00:40.896 A:middle
麻烦举手示意一下.

00:00:41.646 --> 00:00:42.846 A:middle
看来不少(已上架了)啊.

00:00:43.096 --> 00:00:44.946 A:middle
欢迎各位来到WWDC, 相信童鞋们会不虚此行. 

00:00:45.576 --> 00:00:48.706 A:middle
那么, 有多少人是刚开始学习或者正开始

00:00:48.706 --> 00:00:50.466 A:middle
iOS/Mac/Watch应用开发的?

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.306 A:middle
也有一些.

00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:53.726 A:middle
同样欢迎各位.

00:00:54.326 --> 00:00:57.196 A:middle
那么, 在这些正构建或已构建的应用中,

00:00:57.196 --> 00:01:01.196 A:middle
有多少是发布在浏览器上的?

00:01:02.526 --> 00:01:03.966 A:middle
好的. 也有一些, 

00:01:04.696 --> 00:01:05.355 A:middle
但并不多.

00:01:07.036 --> 00:01:09.366 A:middle
但是有多少人会在你的应用内内嵌一个微型浏览器, 

00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:12.426 A:middle
以便用户点击(网络内容)时, 可以直接在应用中直接展示.

00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:13.446 A:middle
天啊, 所有人的手都举起来了.

00:01:13.816 --> 00:01:17.696 A:middle
好的, 我叫Ricky Mondello, 一名来自Safari和

00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:21.636 A:middle
WebKit团队的工程师. 接下来的半个小时, 

00:01:21.636 --> 00:01:22.786 A:middle
就由我来给大家讲解如何内嵌这种

00:01:22.786 --> 00:01:24.506 A:middle
微型浏览器.

00:01:25.516 --> 00:01:30.646 A:middle
[ 鼓掌欢呼 ]

00:01:31.146 --> 00:01:31.336 A:middle
&gt;&gt; RICK: 我将展示

00:01:31.336 --> 00:01:33.726 A:middle
如何使用Safari或者新的控件

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:38.056 A:middle
Safari View Controller(iOS9), 以便童鞋们

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:39.446 A:middle
可以更加专注于

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.076 A:middle
你应用中最棒的部分(业务逻辑/体验等).

00:01:41.596 --> 00:01:43.206 A:middle
同时, 可以提供给你的用户

00:01:43.206 --> 00:01:44.736 A:middle
所钟爱的Safari特性.

00:01:45.736 --> 00:01:46.796 A:middle
如果准备好了, 我们就开始吧.

00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:52.096 A:middle
这次的主题中心是网页内容.

00:01:52.816 --> 00:01:55.126 A:middle
网页内容可以有各种类型的资源, 各种形式的

00:01:55.126 --> 00:01:58.026 A:middle
展示方式. 但今天的讨论, 

00:01:58.026 --> 00:01:59.916 A:middle
我们只提两个方面.

00:02:00.656 --> 00:02:03.316 A:middle
第一点, 应用内恰好有使用

00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:07.526 A:middle
HTML/JS/CSS编辑的内容.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:10.406 A:middle
这些内容可能是后台私有的(计算)

00:02:10.406 --> 00:02:12.216 A:middle
或者用于特效展示

00:02:13.116 --> 00:02:15.566 A:middle
最重要的是, 这些内容跟传统浏览器中

00:02:15.566 --> 00:02:16.816 A:middle
展示的内容不一样.

00:02:17.356 --> 00:02:19.306 A:middle
用户们并不是在浏览网页.

00:02:20.616 --> 00:02:22.026 A:middle
所以我们必须采用另一种方式对待.

00:02:22.526 --> 00:02:26.146 A:middle
当用户在应用内点击一个链接时, 

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.986 A:middle
你希望展示一个有点像Safari的视图, 

00:02:28.336 --> 00:02:30.036 A:middle
这样他们仅能进行短期浏览.

00:02:31.616 --> 00:02:35.526 A:middle
这次讲解主要就是这种应用场景.

00:02:36.026 --> 00:02:37.726 A:middle
我们将看看, 如何通过Safari

00:02:38.026 --> 00:02:41.456 A:middle
或Safari View Controller来给

00:02:41.456 --> 00:02:43.036 A:middle
你的应用添加特性和亮点.

00:02:44.036 --> 00:02:46.066 A:middle
但在开始前, 我还是想给大家

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:47.306 A:middle
快速过一下其它的应用场景.

00:02:47.706 --> 00:02:51.216 A:middle
例如: 你希望在应用内提供网页内容, 

00:02:51.216 --> 00:02:51.786 A:middle
但又不希望它看起来像传统的浏览器, 

00:02:51.786 --> 00:02:55.676 A:middle
你可能会使用WKWebView或者UIWebView. 

00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:59.896 A:middle
其中, 你会更倾向于使用WKWebView, 

00:02:59.896 --> 00:03:01.696 A:middle
因为它就像你的朋友. 

00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:06.136 A:middle
这个类是在iOS 8和Yosemite中引入的, 

00:03:06.876 --> 00:03:09.416 A:middle
基本上来说它就是个包围网页内容的矩形框, 

00:03:10.536 --> 00:03:14.166 A:middle
你可以往其中加载一个页面. 当然, 

00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:15.716 A:middle
你也可以调用JS去获取运行结果, 

00:03:15.716 --> 00:03:16.716 A:middle
而不是(单调地)展示当前页面.

00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:20.226 A:middle
你还可以修改其中的导航或者阻止它们跳转.

00:03:20.926 --> 00:03:23.056 A:middle
你甚至能在里边自定义UI.

00:03:23.716 --> 00:03:27.556 A:middle
后退/前进按钮, 通信进度条... 诸如此类.

00:03:28.256 --> 00:03:33.856 A:middle
同时, 在新的iOS 9和El Capitan(10.11新系统)中, 

00:03:33.856 --> 00:03:36.416 A:middle
我们听取并吸收了童鞋们的反馈意见, 

00:03:36.486 --> 00:03:38.406 A:middle
补足了一些WKWebView所缺失的地方.

00:03:40.056 --> 00:03:43.946 A:middle
首先, 你可以安全地加载文件了(loadFileURLs).

00:03:45.516 --> 00:03:50.546 A:middle
[ 鼓掌 ]

00:03:51.046 --> 00:03:52.306 A:middle
你也可以加载数据了(loadData), 

00:03:52.306 --> 00:03:55.156 A:middle
例如你期望的HTML文本串.

00:03:55.806 --> 00:03:57.126 A:middle
没必要去旋转加速(spin up)服务器.

00:03:57.426 --> 00:04:01.906 A:middle
如你所愿, 你也可以设置自定义代理了(customUserAgent).

00:04:02.896 --> 00:04:03.296 A:middle
[ 鼓掌 ]

00:04:07.966 --> 00:04:11.206 A:middle
我们还提供了一个新的API, 用于管理网页存储中

00:04:11.206 --> 00:04:14.526 A:middle
cookies/caches或其它类型的数据.

00:04:14.616 --> 00:04:17.896 A:middle
它叫WKWebsiteDataStore.

00:04:18.486 --> 00:04:21.276 A:middle
这是你网页视图的WKWebViewConfiguration

00:04:21.396 --> 00:04:23.886 A:middle
中一个可读/可写的属性.

00:04:24.896 --> 00:04:28.116 A:middle
使用这个数据存储, 你可以根据数据类型来删除数据, 

00:04:28.816 --> 00:04:31.936 A:middle
也可以删除最近一个小时添加的所有数据.

00:04:31.936 --> 00:04:33.806 A:middle
这些特性都非常棒.

00:04:34.406 --> 00:04:37.336 A:middle
由于提供了这个属性, 

00:04:37.626 --> 00:04:41.526 A:middle
你的配置存储是可写的. 这意味着你可以使用一个

00:04:41.526 --> 00:04:43.446 A:middle
短期配置来替换它. 

00:04:43.876 --> 00:04:45.036 A:middle
这就是你实现这种

00:04:45.036 --> 00:04:46.466 A:middle
私密浏览模式的秘诀.

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:53.366 A:middle
WKWebView是最适合你

00:04:53.366 --> 00:04:55.426 A:middle
拥有/控制/定制化

00:04:55.986 --> 00:04:58.246 A:middle
网页内容的工具.

00:04:59.116 --> 00:05:03.936 A:middle
在iOS 9和El Capitan中, 我们给你提供了比以往

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:04.756 A:middle
更多的灵活性.

00:05:04.756 --> 00:05:10.476 A:middle
但如果你坐在这里想(静静:)): 能不能简单点,

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:12.356 A:middle
傻瓜点, 我不需要这种灵活性,

00:05:12.356 --> 00:05:14.236 A:middle
我压根不需要JS来”搞”我的页面.

00:05:14.886 --> 00:05:17.116 A:middle
我也不需要跳来跳去(像个二哈),

00:05:17.276 --> 00:05:19.926 A:middle
我更不想将我的后退和前进按钮弄得花里胡哨,

00:05:20.766 --> 00:05:22.076 A:middle
那么接下来的内容就是给这些童鞋准备的.

00:05:25.836 --> 00:05:28.296 A:middle
接下来, 我们将探讨如何使用Safari或者

00:05:28.706 --> 00:05:31.546 A:middle
Safari View Controller, 减少代码量, 

00:05:31.546 --> 00:05:34.586 A:middle
并提供更好的用户体验. 

00:05:35.316 --> 00:05:37.036 A:middle
关于这点, 童鞋们的第一个意见是

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:39.296 A:middle
简化代理的责任,

00:05:39.296 --> 00:05:41.416 A:middle
将展示网页内容交给Safari.

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:44.036 A:middle
这也非常容易做到.

00:05:44.326 --> 00:05:47.156 A:middle
你只需调用UIApplication的openURL方法,

00:05:47.716 --> 00:05:50.616 A:middle
然后iOS会从你的App切换到Safari.

00:05:51.296 --> 00:05:55.786 A:middle
当然, 你们昨天看到的最新的iOS 9系统演示中, 

00:05:55.786 --> 00:05:58.296 A:middle
有展示过(从Safari)跳转回到App,

00:05:58.716 --> 00:06:00.216 A:middle
这种效果比以往的处理更合理有效.

00:06:00.696 --> 00:06:02.606 A:middle
与iOS 8相比, 它更显轻量了.

00:06:03.516 --> 00:06:08.596 A:middle
[ 鼓掌 ]

00:06:09.096 --> 00:06:10.796 A:middle
同时, 由Safari代理负责

00:06:10.796 --> 00:06:13.246 A:middle
显示网页内容的做法,

00:06:13.246 --> 00:06:15.356 A:middle
让用户获得一流的

00:06:15.356 --> 00:06:16.266 A:middle
网页内容体验效果.

00:06:16.846 --> 00:06:18.076 A:middle
这就是Safari所能提供的一切.

00:06:19.396 --> 00:06:22.286 A:middle
如果你希望用户获得一体化的体验效果, 用户

00:06:22.706 --> 00:06:26.016 A:middle
在使用App时不需要离开你的App, 那么你一定

00:06:26.016 --> 00:06:27.796 A:middle
会对Safari View Controller感兴趣.

00:06:29.176 --> 00:06:30.566 A:middle
让我们瞄一瞄.

00:06:32.296 --> 00:06:35.626 A:middle
这个网页apple.com是放在Safari View Controller

00:06:35.806 --> 00:06:38.146 A:middle
中展示的, 里边网页内容呈现略微变灰(不可编辑).

00:06:39.456 --> 00:06:41.726 A:middle
首先你也许会注意到, 

00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:44.366 A:middle
Safari View Controller长得很像Safari, 

00:06:44.866 --> 00:06:46.336 A:middle
但又有意(将它们)整得不太一样.

00:06:47.646 --> 00:06:50.856 A:middle
Safari View Controller的工作就是, 快速/简洁/

00:06:50.946 --> 00:06:54.066 A:middle
愉快地在你的应用中展示一个链接内容给用户, 

00:06:55.236 --> 00:06:58.456 A:middle
并在用户点击done按钮时返回你的应用.

00:07:00.006 --> 00:07:02.336 A:middle
Safari View Controller消除所有分心的东西.

00:07:03.126 --> 00:07:05.826 A:middle
URL处(地址栏)是只读的.

00:07:06.136 --> 00:07:06.986 A:middle
用户不能修改它.

00:07:06.986 --> 00:07:09.136 A:middle
而且, 它也仅仅是一个页面.

00:07:09.486 --> 00:07:11.206 A:middle
再也没有多余的点击来让用户分神(思考).

00:07:11.746 --> 00:07:14.316 A:middle
如大家所见, 这个类名称中有个Safari(瞎子都看到了~), 

00:07:14.706 --> 00:07:16.746 A:middle
所以Safari View Controller也提供了用户们

00:07:17.586 --> 00:07:19.736 A:middle
所钟爱的Safari特性, 

00:07:20.486 --> 00:07:22.096 A:middle
现在你可以将它们都加进你的应用了.

00:07:23.156 --> 00:07:25.346 A:middle
让我们启动吧. 首先

00:07:25.346 --> 00:07:28.286 A:middle
Safari View Controller与Safari共享

00:07:28.286 --> 00:07:30.016 A:middle
cookies和其它网页数据.

00:07:31.086 --> 00:07:34.126 A:middle
所以这意味着如果你的用户已经在Safari中

00:07:34.126 --> 00:07:38.376 A:middle
登陆了一个网页, 那么当用户在你的应用中

00:07:38.376 --> 00:07:39.546 A:middle
(Safari View Controller)点击这个网页链接时,

00:07:39.546 --> 00:07:41.466 A:middle
他们依然是处于登陆状态.

00:07:42.366 --> 00:07:43.966 A:middle
如果他们并没有登陆, 

00:07:44.366 --> 00:07:45.366 A:middle
我们也提供了便捷的接口, 

00:07:46.756 --> 00:07:48.656 A:middle
因为Safari View Controller允许你

00:07:48.656 --> 00:07:52.166 A:middle
使用密码自动填充功能, 这些密码是通过

00:07:52.166 --> 00:07:55.096 A:middle
iCloud密钥链在你所有设备中存储和同步.

00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:59.196 A:middle
我必须告诉童鞋们的是, 这种方式对于

00:07:59.196 --> 00:08:02.316 A:middle
你的用户来说, 其实是非常安全的.

00:08:02.676 --> 00:08:05.386 A:middle
为啥? (嘿嘿)因为我们只是给你的用户

00:08:05.386 --> 00:08:08.906 A:middle
提供了信任授权/用户名和密码的访问权限, 

00:08:09.176 --> 00:08:12.346 A:middle
但我们并没有给你的应用提供

00:08:12.346 --> 00:08:13.796 A:middle
这些数据的访问授权.

00:08:14.916 --> 00:08:18.716 A:middle
事实上, Safari View Controller是

00:08:18.716 --> 00:08:19.636 A:middle
完全独立于你的应用的一个进程.

00:08:20.186 --> 00:08:23.086 A:middle
这种措施, 会让你免于考虑这种

00:08:23.206 --> 00:08:25.946 A:middle
重要又敏感的用户数据问题.

00:08:26.786 --> 00:08:27.326 A:middle
我们全包了!

00:08:27.396 --> 00:08:29.986 A:middle
OK, 让我们回到这些特性吧.

00:08:30.556 --> 00:08:35.216 A:middle
When a user wants to have
something shipped to their home

00:08:35.216 --> 00:08:38.696 A:middle
or to their work they'll be able
to use Contact Card Autofill

00:08:38.696 --> 00:08:41.056 A:middle
to fill that information just
like they could in Safari.

00:08:41.746 --> 00:08:45.526 A:middle
And when it comes time to make
a purchase they'll be able

00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:50.216 A:middle
to fill their credit
cards as well.

00:08:50.406 --> 00:08:51.616 A:middle
And if one of your users comes

00:08:51.616 --> 00:08:55.896 A:middle
across an article that's
interesting, compelling,

00:08:56.366 --> 00:08:58.856 A:middle
but difficult to
read, she will be able

00:08:58.856 --> 00:09:01.496 A:middle
to use the Safari
Reader button in order



00:08:58.856 --> 00:09:01.496 A:middle
to use the Safari
Reader button in order

00:09:01.496 --> 00:09:05.146 A:middle
to show a simplified cleaned
up version of that content.

00:09:05.736 --> 00:09:06.316 A:middle
Super great.

00:09:06.446 --> 00:09:10.946 A:middle
And new to iOS 9 in both
Safari and, of course,

00:09:10.946 --> 00:09:14.246 A:middle
in Safari View Controller,
Reader is customizable,

00:09:14.946 --> 00:09:17.366 A:middle
offering a bunch of themes
and some fonts to choose from.

00:09:17.856 --> 00:09:19.596 A:middle
So it's never been
easier to read articles

00:09:19.596 --> 00:09:23.296 A:middle
on the web exactly the way you
want to and your users want to.

00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:29.946 A:middle
From the share button you'll
find exactly what you expect.

00:09:31.346 --> 00:09:33.986 A:middle
You'll find the system
wide options for sharing

00:09:34.326 --> 00:09:37.356 A:middle
to social networks and you'll
also find the ability to add

00:09:37.356 --> 00:09:39.716 A:middle
to one's reading list,
but that's not all

00:09:39.716 --> 00:09:40.376 A:middle
that you'll find here.

00:09:41.416 --> 00:09:44.286 A:middle
Because alongside these
activities are activities

00:09:44.286 --> 00:09:46.716 A:middle
that your app provides to
Safari View Controller.

00:09:47.866 --> 00:09:49.976 A:middle
So if your app is
a social network,

00:09:50.366 --> 00:09:52.526 A:middle
you can have a dedicated
button in the share sheet

00:09:52.736 --> 00:09:55.356 A:middle
to share the current web
page to the social network.

00:09:56.066 --> 00:09:56.536 A:middle
Really cool.

00:09:57.106 --> 00:09:59.946 A:middle
And while we're on the
topic of customization,



00:10:00.956 --> 00:10:04.126 A:middle
Safari View Controller will
respect a custom tint color

00:10:04.416 --> 00:10:06.606 A:middle
that your app sets on it.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:09.996 A:middle
So in this case up on the slide
the tint color has been changed

00:10:09.996 --> 00:10:12.216 A:middle
from Safari's default
blue to orange.

00:10:12.966 --> 00:10:15.186 A:middle
This is a great way to let
users know which app they're

00:10:15.186 --> 00:10:16.826 A:middle
in when using Safari
View Controller.

00:10:18.756 --> 00:10:22.826 A:middle
This next feature is really
awesome and it's new to iOS 9.

00:10:24.006 --> 00:10:27.836 A:middle
It's called Content Blocking
-- go ahead [chuckles]!

00:10:28.516 --> 00:10:31.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:32.046 --> 00:10:33.786 A:middle
&gt;&gt; RICKY MONDELLO: So the big
idea behind Content Blocking,

00:10:34.326 --> 00:10:36.746 A:middle
is that it's possible to add
something to the experience

00:10:36.746 --> 00:10:39.376 A:middle
of viewing a web page by
taking something away.

00:10:40.386 --> 00:10:44.346 A:middle
In iOS 9, any app can write
a description of web content

00:10:44.676 --> 00:10:47.716 A:middle
that Safari and Safari View
Controller should block

00:10:47.716 --> 00:10:48.976 A:middle
as the user browses the Web.

00:10:48.976 --> 00:10:50.966 A:middle
So lets take a look
at an example.

00:10:51.536 --> 00:10:56.446 A:middle
Here's a web page that has
some pretty cool content,

00:10:57.076 --> 00:10:59.486 A:middle
but in my case I
really don't like all

00:10:59.486 --> 00:11:01.676 A:middle
of the clickbait headlines
that are in that side bar.



00:10:59.486 --> 00:11:01.676 A:middle
of the clickbait headlines
that are in that side bar.

00:11:02.536 --> 00:11:05.056 A:middle
So if you install the right
content blocker you won't

00:11:05.056 --> 00:11:06.156 A:middle
believe what happens
next [chuckles].

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.586 A:middle
Oh, well, you will.

00:11:10.266 --> 00:11:11.196 A:middle
The content disappears.

00:11:12.516 --> 00:11:16.096 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:11:16.596 --> 00:11:17.356 A:middle
&gt;&gt; RICKY MONDELLO:
But that's not all

00:11:17.356 --> 00:11:18.956 A:middle
that Content Blocking
is capable of.

00:11:19.476 --> 00:11:21.126 A:middle
Content Blocking
can do a lot more

00:11:21.126 --> 00:11:22.956 A:middle
than hiding elements on a page.

00:11:23.546 --> 00:11:25.716 A:middle
You can out right block
loads from happening.

00:11:26.316 --> 00:11:28.846 A:middle
You can block all
images or all scripts

00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:31.506 A:middle
from a third-party domain that
you're not really fond of.

00:11:32.556 --> 00:11:35.006 A:middle
And all of the content
blockers that a user turns

00:11:35.056 --> 00:11:38.126 A:middle
on in settings will
apply in both Safari

00:11:38.746 --> 00:11:40.016 A:middle
and in Safari View Controller.

00:11:41.176 --> 00:11:42.416 A:middle
So what this means for you is

00:11:42.946 --> 00:11:45.286 A:middle
after you've switched
your miniature web browser

00:11:45.286 --> 00:11:48.816 A:middle
implementation over to using
Safari View Controller you won't

00:11:48.816 --> 00:11:50.986 A:middle
get any complaints that
your users' ad blocker is

00:11:50.986 --> 00:11:51.426 A:middle
not working.

00:11:52.206 --> 00:11:53.226 A:middle
Pretty cool.

00:11:54.296 --> 00:11:55.496 A:middle
So that's a bunch of features.

00:11:56.556 --> 00:11:57.706 A:middle
Let's talk about safety.

00:11:58.286 --> 00:12:02.346 A:middle
I mentioned a moment ago that
Safari View Controller runs



00:11:58.286 --> 00:12:02.346 A:middle
I mentioned a moment ago that
Safari View Controller runs

00:12:02.346 --> 00:12:05.306 A:middle
in a separate process from your
app which frees you from a lot

00:12:05.306 --> 00:12:07.996 A:middle
of responsibilities of thinking
about important user data.

00:12:08.826 --> 00:12:11.176 A:middle
But when it comes to
browsing web content,

00:12:11.916 --> 00:12:14.456 A:middle
it's just as important to
have an expressive interface

00:12:14.546 --> 00:12:16.296 A:middle
that communicates
security to a user,

00:12:16.996 --> 00:12:19.406 A:middle
and Safari View Controller
does the same exact job

00:12:19.696 --> 00:12:20.986 A:middle
that Safari does in this regard.

00:12:21.496 --> 00:12:25.046 A:middle
First and foremost secure pages.

00:12:25.846 --> 00:12:28.856 A:middle
Safari View Controller
communicates the validity of SSL

00:12:29.346 --> 00:12:31.196 A:middle
to your users just
like Safari does.

00:12:32.476 --> 00:12:34.876 A:middle
But if the user is having
a bad day and they come

00:12:34.876 --> 00:12:35.966 A:middle
across a phishing page,

00:12:36.736 --> 00:12:38.976 A:middle
Safari View Controller will
also warn them about that

00:12:39.096 --> 00:12:40.466 A:middle
and ask them to turn around,

00:12:41.016 --> 00:12:42.966 A:middle
exactly the same way
that Safari would.

00:12:43.546 --> 00:12:49.556 A:middle
So to recap, Safari View
Controller has all the great

00:12:49.556 --> 00:12:51.336 A:middle
features of Safari itself.

00:12:51.636 --> 00:12:53.306 A:middle
The features that your
users already love.

00:12:54.306 --> 00:12:57.576 A:middle
Like the ability to fill their
passwords, have shared cookies,

00:12:58.186 --> 00:12:59.906 A:middle
clean up articles
with Safari Reader



00:13:00.306 --> 00:13:02.686 A:middle
and in iOS 9, Content Blocking.

00:13:03.996 --> 00:13:06.236 A:middle
There are also a few
other minor things

00:13:06.966 --> 00:13:10.126 A:middle
like correctly communicating
progress while progress is

00:13:10.126 --> 00:13:11.496 A:middle
loading with a nice
progress bar.

00:13:12.626 --> 00:13:14.426 A:middle
And showing informative
error pages

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:16.336 A:middle
when something goes
wrong during a load.

00:13:17.256 --> 00:13:20.076 A:middle
Your miniature web browsers
may or may not be doing all

00:13:20.076 --> 00:13:23.746 A:middle
of these things, but with Safari
View Controller it doesn't have

00:13:23.816 --> 00:13:27.906 A:middle
to, because adopting it will
add years of Safari features

00:13:27.906 --> 00:13:30.646 A:middle
and polish to your
apps and future years

00:13:30.646 --> 00:13:32.226 A:middle
of polish in the future.

00:13:32.776 --> 00:13:36.996 A:middle
I'm happy to say that adopting
Safari View Controller is

00:13:36.996 --> 00:13:37.656 A:middle
really easy.

00:13:38.906 --> 00:13:43.166 A:middle
Let's take a quick
walk through the API.

00:13:43.416 --> 00:13:46.136 A:middle
In code, Safari View
Controller is known

00:13:46.526 --> 00:13:48.296 A:middle
as SFSafariViewController.

00:13:48.866 --> 00:13:50.646 A:middle
It's part of the Safari
Services Framework.

00:13:51.606 --> 00:13:53.736 A:middle
And as you might have
guessed it's a subclass

00:13:53.736 --> 00:13:54.646 A:middle
of UIViewController.

00:13:55.236 --> 00:13:59.166 A:middle
It has a delegate which
I'll get to in a moment,

00:13:59.956 --> 00:14:02.096 A:middle
and initializer which
takes a URL.



00:13:59.956 --> 00:14:02.096 A:middle
and initializer which
takes a URL.

00:14:02.826 --> 00:14:05.256 A:middle
This is the URL of the web
page that your user tapped on,

00:14:05.796 --> 00:14:06.906 A:middle
the web page that
you want to show.

00:14:08.206 --> 00:14:10.086 A:middle
Let's look at that
delegate real quick.

00:14:12.256 --> 00:14:15.506 A:middle
The first method in the delegate
is how you can provide your own

00:14:15.506 --> 00:14:17.176 A:middle
custom activities
to the share sheet

00:14:17.486 --> 00:14:18.796 A:middle
when the user taps
on the share button.

00:14:19.376 --> 00:14:23.656 A:middle
And the second delegate method
is called when the user taps

00:14:23.656 --> 00:14:25.396 A:middle
on the done button, when
they're done browsing.

00:14:25.916 --> 00:14:27.656 A:middle
You're going to want to
implement this in order

00:14:27.656 --> 00:14:28.926 A:middle
to dismiss the View Controller.

00:14:29.416 --> 00:14:35.296 A:middle
Taken all together it's
a pretty simple API.

00:14:35.296 --> 00:14:39.776 A:middle
And to show you just how
powerful this simple API can be

00:14:40.206 --> 00:14:42.686 A:middle
and how many lines of code it
will remove from your apps,

00:14:43.276 --> 00:14:45.336 A:middle
I'm delighted to invite
my colleague Yongjun

00:14:45.336 --> 00:14:46.736 A:middle
to the stage for a demo.

00:14:47.306 --> 00:14:47.626 A:middle
Yongjun.

00:14:56.136 --> 00:14:58.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; YONGJUN ZHANG:
Thank you, Ricky.

00:14:58.416 --> 00:14:59.026 A:middle
Hi, everyone.

00:14:59.086 --> 00:15:00.106 A:middle
My name is Yongjun.



00:14:59.086 --> 00:15:00.106 A:middle
My name is Yongjun.

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:02.196 A:middle
I'm a Safari and
WebKit engineer.

00:15:02.806 --> 00:15:07.286 A:middle
I don't know about
you, but I really want

00:15:07.286 --> 00:15:08.326 A:middle
to have some pizza today.

00:15:09.506 --> 00:15:12.956 A:middle
So I'm writing an app to
find pizza stores around me.

00:15:14.286 --> 00:15:15.086 A:middle
Here it is.

00:15:15.976 --> 00:15:16.896 A:middle
I call it pizza finder.

00:15:17.586 --> 00:15:18.966 A:middle
I got a list of pizza stores.

00:15:20.026 --> 00:15:23.456 A:middle
If I select the first store, I
got the phone number, address,

00:15:24.096 --> 00:15:26.696 A:middle
I also get a link to the
website of the store.

00:15:28.086 --> 00:15:31.146 A:middle
My task now is to make
my app show the website

00:15:31.706 --> 00:15:35.166 A:middle
so I can know more
about a store.

00:15:35.366 --> 00:15:38.276 A:middle
As Rick mentioned we
got three options.

00:15:39.146 --> 00:15:44.206 A:middle
Option one, use openURL and let
Safari open the website for us.

00:15:45.406 --> 00:15:47.736 A:middle
Option two, you establish
a web view

00:15:48.476 --> 00:15:51.156 A:middle
and make our own browsing app.

00:15:51.156 --> 00:15:53.526 A:middle
And option three, use
Safari View Controller.

00:15:54.396 --> 00:15:56.056 A:middle
I am going to try
option one first.

00:15:57.376 --> 00:15:58.916 A:middle
So I go to my Xcode project.



00:16:00.036 --> 00:16:04.996 A:middle
And here in my store view
controller I got a function

00:16:04.996 --> 00:16:06.386 A:middle
here, showStoreWebsite.

00:16:08.926 --> 00:16:13.036 A:middle
I just need to drag one line
of code UIApplication, openURL.

00:16:13.586 --> 00:16:15.896 A:middle
This will let Safari
open the URL.

00:16:16.806 --> 00:16:18.146 A:middle
Let's test it.

00:16:19.516 --> 00:16:25.286 A:middle
I run the app and select
the first store, left click.

00:16:26.326 --> 00:16:28.726 A:middle
Now, Safari opens
the website for me

00:16:29.486 --> 00:16:31.826 A:middle
and I can see this
page has a Reader.

00:16:33.306 --> 00:16:39.536 A:middle
And if I try to order
pizza, I got my user name

00:16:39.536 --> 00:16:41.096 A:middle
and password autofilled.

00:16:41.906 --> 00:16:43.686 A:middle
So I must have been
to this site before

00:16:43.686 --> 00:16:47.106 A:middle
and maybe I ordered
a pizza before.

00:16:47.666 --> 00:16:48.786 A:middle
Now I'm in Safari.

00:16:49.956 --> 00:16:53.096 A:middle
What I really want is my users
to always stay in my app.

00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:55.196 A:middle
I don't want them to
switch to Safari just

00:16:55.196 --> 00:16:57.606 A:middle
for visiting one
or two websites.

00:16:58.346 --> 00:16:59.886 A:middle
Because they can get distracted

00:16:59.956 --> 00:17:02.266 A:middle
and might not come
back to my app later.



00:16:59.956 --> 00:17:02.266 A:middle
and might not come
back to my app later.

00:17:03.286 --> 00:17:05.256 A:middle
So I really need a
browser in my app.

00:17:05.866 --> 00:17:10.215 A:middle
I'm going to try option 2
now to make my own browser.

00:17:11.705 --> 00:17:16.736 A:middle
So first thing I want to do,
I want to go back to my app.

00:17:17.026 --> 00:17:21.726 A:middle
So as we know, if we have
some web content in the app

00:17:21.726 --> 00:17:26.256 A:middle
and if the web content happens
to be my UI or part of my UI,

00:17:27.556 --> 00:17:29.506 A:middle
WKWebView is the best
tool for that job.

00:17:30.836 --> 00:17:34.366 A:middle
In my case I wanted
to use WKWebView

00:17:34.366 --> 00:17:37.446 A:middle
to load web pages
certainly, but I also want

00:17:37.446 --> 00:17:38.626 A:middle
to have some UI around that.

00:17:38.726 --> 00:17:41.446 A:middle
For example, I want
to have a URL bar

00:17:41.446 --> 00:17:43.226 A:middle
on the top to show the URL.

00:17:43.226 --> 00:17:47.576 A:middle
I also would like to have
a toolbar in the bottom

00:17:47.746 --> 00:17:49.196 A:middle
to do back and forth navigation.

00:17:50.626 --> 00:17:53.616 A:middle
WKWebView is a very rich
API, it provides a number

00:17:53.616 --> 00:17:55.596 A:middle
of delegates I can use to listen

00:17:55.596 --> 00:17:57.646 A:middle
to page load events
or navigation events.

00:17:58.276 --> 00:18:00.596 A:middle
I can use this delegate
to drive my UI.



00:17:58.276 --> 00:18:00.596 A:middle
I can use this delegate
to drive my UI.

00:18:01.826 --> 00:18:04.436 A:middle
So to save us some
time for this demo,

00:18:04.436 --> 00:18:06.036 A:middle
I already have a single browser.

00:18:06.766 --> 00:18:07.376 A:middle
Let's take a look.

00:18:07.516 --> 00:18:10.956 A:middle
So in the Xcode project I
switched to another tab.

00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:17.026 A:middle
I wrapped my simple browser
into one view controller.

00:18:17.816 --> 00:18:20.226 A:middle
And in the middle
I got WKWebView.

00:18:21.086 --> 00:18:24.176 A:middle
On the top I got
the navigation bar.

00:18:24.176 --> 00:18:26.796 A:middle
I use the navigation bar's
title to show the URL.

00:18:26.796 --> 00:18:31.226 A:middle
In the bottom I have a back
and forth button to do back

00:18:31.226 --> 00:18:32.136 A:middle
and forward navigation.

00:18:33.246 --> 00:18:34.956 A:middle
Now this is a simple class.

00:18:34.956 --> 00:18:36.746 A:middle
It has about eighty
lines of code.

00:18:37.316 --> 00:18:38.636 A:middle
It took me about one hour.

00:18:38.636 --> 00:18:40.506 A:middle
I believe we can do better.

00:18:41.206 --> 00:18:43.226 A:middle
But anyway, let's
test this browser.

00:18:44.296 --> 00:18:47.526 A:middle
So I go back to my
store view controller,

00:18:48.306 --> 00:18:52.526 A:middle
remove this line we just added
and drag a couple lines here.

00:18:53.906 --> 00:18:57.226 A:middle
What I am doing now is I
load my view controller

00:18:57.226 --> 00:19:01.886 A:middle
from the story board assigned
a URL to it and presented it.



00:18:57.226 --> 00:19:01.886 A:middle
from the story board assigned
a URL to it and presented it.

00:19:02.936 --> 00:19:04.366 A:middle
Now let's take a look.

00:19:06.836 --> 00:19:07.786 A:middle
I run my app.

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:11.526 A:middle
Select the first store
and tap the link.

00:19:12.256 --> 00:19:13.426 A:middle
This is my browser.

00:19:14.126 --> 00:19:16.806 A:middle
It runs in my app.

00:19:17.066 --> 00:19:20.716 A:middle
I don't have to switch to Safari
to visit this site anymore.

00:19:20.806 --> 00:19:21.296 A:middle
That's good.

00:19:22.276 --> 00:19:24.026 A:middle
The URL bar is actually
grayed out.

00:19:24.026 --> 00:19:25.656 A:middle
So it won't be distracting.

00:19:26.866 --> 00:19:30.456 A:middle
But also notice when I drag the
page I don't have the dynamics

00:19:30.496 --> 00:19:31.386 A:middle
of Safari's UI.

00:19:32.796 --> 00:19:34.456 A:middle
And this page doesn't
have a Reader.

00:19:34.456 --> 00:19:36.136 A:middle
It will be harder
for me to read now.

00:19:37.216 --> 00:19:41.236 A:middle
And if I try to order pizza,
I don't have my user name

00:19:41.236 --> 00:19:42.356 A:middle
and password autofilled.

00:19:42.786 --> 00:19:45.056 A:middle
So it will be harder for me
to order pizza now especially

00:19:45.316 --> 00:19:46.866 A:middle
when I'm hungry, and impatient,

00:19:46.866 --> 00:19:47.806 A:middle
and I don't have my
password [laughter].

00:19:49.616 --> 00:19:54.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; YONGJUN ZHANG: So, what
I really need is some simple

00:19:54.176 --> 00:19:59.076 A:middle
and easy way to show
a website from my app.

00:19:59.846 --> 00:20:01.246 A:middle
I don't want to spend my time



00:19:59.846 --> 00:20:01.246 A:middle
I don't want to spend my time

00:20:01.246 --> 00:20:03.886 A:middle
to implement missing
features like progress bar.

00:20:04.356 --> 00:20:07.576 A:middle
Even though I want to spend time
there are some features I will

00:20:07.576 --> 00:20:08.306 A:middle
never get to.

00:20:08.306 --> 00:20:11.866 A:middle
For example, Password Autofill.

00:20:12.906 --> 00:20:15.496 A:middle
I would never get users'
passwords for this website.

00:20:16.836 --> 00:20:19.796 A:middle
Luckily in iOS 9 we have
a Safari View Controller.

00:20:20.186 --> 00:20:21.406 A:middle
Let's take a look.

00:20:23.256 --> 00:20:25.546 A:middle
So to take Safari View
Controller into use,

00:20:26.236 --> 00:20:29.436 A:middle
first thing I need to do is
import Safari Services Framework

00:20:30.626 --> 00:20:33.826 A:middle
and then I need to make
my view controller conform

00:20:33.826 --> 00:20:35.576 A:middle
to
SFSafariViewControllerDelegate

00:20:35.646 --> 00:20:36.046 A:middle
protocol.

00:20:36.776 --> 00:20:41.456 A:middle
In the code, let's go
back to showStoreWebsite.

00:20:42.456 --> 00:20:45.036 A:middle
I don't need my browser
anymore, so I remove that.

00:20:46.306 --> 00:20:49.026 A:middle
And just drag a couple
of lines here.

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:53.506 A:middle
What I'm doing now
is I instantiate my

00:20:53.786 --> 00:20:58.786 A:middle
SafariViewControler object,
gives delegate and present it.

00:20:59.616 --> 00:21:02.056 A:middle
Before we test it I also need



00:20:59.616 --> 00:21:02.056 A:middle
Before we test it I also need

00:21:02.056 --> 00:21:05.386 A:middle
to implement
safariViewControllerDidFinish,

00:21:05.826 --> 00:21:08.846 A:middle
when the user taps
the done button,

00:21:09.376 --> 00:21:11.006 A:middle
and we can dismiss
the view controller.

00:21:12.136 --> 00:21:16.236 A:middle
Since we are here we don't
need our browser anymore,

00:21:16.436 --> 00:21:19.936 A:middle
so we can delete the whole
thing, move to Trash, yes.

00:21:20.336 --> 00:21:23.726 A:middle
Eighty lines of code
down and one hour saved.

00:21:24.536 --> 00:21:25.246 A:middle
Let's run again.

00:21:26.036 --> 00:21:30.126 A:middle
Select the first store.

00:21:31.536 --> 00:21:33.236 A:middle
Look! I have Safari in my app.

00:21:34.936 --> 00:21:38.166 A:middle
So I got Reader back.

00:21:38.776 --> 00:21:42.206 A:middle
The same dynamics as
Safari, and if I try

00:21:42.206 --> 00:21:47.266 A:middle
to order pizza now I have my
user name and password back.

00:21:48.406 --> 00:21:52.466 A:middle
As you see, with a couple lines
of code I have Safari in my app.

00:21:53.396 --> 00:21:54.876 A:middle
You can do that for
your app, too.

00:21:55.026 --> 00:21:56.606 A:middle
And the user would be
really happy about it.

00:21:56.956 --> 00:21:57.526 A:middle
Thank you.

00:21:58.516 --> 00:22:02.926 A:middle
[ Applause ]



00:21:58.516 --> 00:22:02.926 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:22:03.426 --> 00:22:07.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; YONGJUN ZHANG:
Back to you, Ricky.

00:22:09.556 --> 00:22:10.576 A:middle
&gt;&gt; RICKY MONDELLO:
Thank you, Yongjun.

00:22:10.786 --> 00:22:11.586 A:middle
That is awesome.

00:22:12.526 --> 00:22:16.366 A:middle
So Yongjun just showed you
that although it's easy

00:22:16.366 --> 00:22:20.886 A:middle
to write your in-app web browser
in WKWebView, it's kinda hard

00:22:20.886 --> 00:22:22.356 A:middle
to get all of the details right.

00:22:23.236 --> 00:22:26.156 A:middle
He also showed you by
changing about seven lines

00:22:26.156 --> 00:22:28.746 A:middle
of code he was able to
replace the whole thing

00:22:29.306 --> 00:22:30.526 A:middle
with Safari View Controller.

00:22:31.696 --> 00:22:34.156 A:middle
You got to see how Safari
View Controller has features

00:22:34.156 --> 00:22:37.846 A:middle
like Password Autofill and
Reader and little touches

00:22:37.846 --> 00:22:39.986 A:middle
like the dynamics when you
scroll down on a web page.

00:22:43.956 --> 00:22:47.356 A:middle
When we started a few moments
ago I divided the world

00:22:47.356 --> 00:22:48.946 A:middle
of web content into two buckets.

00:22:49.896 --> 00:22:51.896 A:middle
The kind of stuff that
is custom within your app

00:22:52.406 --> 00:22:54.196 A:middle
that you're going to
use WKWebView for,

00:22:55.206 --> 00:22:58.616 A:middle
or actual websites when a user
taps on a link in your app

00:22:59.016 --> 00:23:01.916 A:middle
which you'll use Safari or
Safari View Controller for.



00:22:59.016 --> 00:23:01.916 A:middle
which you'll use Safari or
Safari View Controller for.

00:23:02.956 --> 00:23:03.896 A:middle
But for a number of you

00:23:03.896 --> 00:23:07.116 A:middle
in the audience there's actually
a third use case for web content

00:23:07.116 --> 00:23:09.306 A:middle
that I would like to
talk about real quick.

00:23:10.696 --> 00:23:13.746 A:middle
That's doing Web-based
authentication using

00:23:13.746 --> 00:23:14.386 A:middle
web content.

00:23:15.486 --> 00:23:17.236 A:middle
So you've all probably
seen this before.

00:23:17.816 --> 00:23:19.716 A:middle
You're in an app
and the app wants

00:23:19.716 --> 00:23:22.706 A:middle
to use some third-party
website's accounts.

00:23:23.346 --> 00:23:24.796 A:middle
The app pulls up a web view.

00:23:24.946 --> 00:23:27.656 A:middle
You type in your user
name and password.

00:23:28.426 --> 00:23:32.536 A:middle
Log in. Then you accept
or deny the app's request

00:23:32.536 --> 00:23:35.106 A:middle
for the resource from
the third-party service.

00:23:35.966 --> 00:23:37.376 A:middle
You've all probably
done this before.

00:23:37.876 --> 00:23:40.126 A:middle
But one flow that
does this is OAuth.

00:23:40.126 --> 00:23:43.566 A:middle
I would like to walk through
at a high level exactly how

00:23:43.566 --> 00:23:44.136 A:middle
that works.

00:23:44.686 --> 00:23:51.156 A:middle
So in this flow there are
three different actors.

00:23:51.736 --> 00:23:54.546 A:middle
The first actor is an app.

00:23:55.366 --> 00:23:57.006 A:middle
Let's say that it's your app.

00:23:57.596 --> 00:23:59.166 A:middle
The second actor is a user.

00:23:59.896 --> 00:24:01.126 A:middle
Let's say it's one
of your users.



00:23:59.896 --> 00:24:01.126 A:middle
Let's say it's one
of your users.

00:24:02.536 --> 00:24:05.096 A:middle
And of course, there is
the third-party web service

00:24:05.266 --> 00:24:07.726 A:middle
that your app would like
to authenticate against.

00:24:08.376 --> 00:24:11.656 A:middle
So what will happen is in this
flow while the user is using the

00:24:11.836 --> 00:24:13.806 A:middle
app, presumably they'll tap

00:24:13.806 --> 00:24:15.526 A:middle
on a button somewhere
that says log in.

00:24:16.156 --> 00:24:17.846 A:middle
The app is going
to package the user

00:24:17.846 --> 00:24:20.236 A:middle
up with a token representing
what it wants

00:24:20.236 --> 00:24:21.626 A:middle
to request from the website.

00:24:22.156 --> 00:24:26.486 A:middle
And then, the app is
going to present, somehow,

00:24:26.546 --> 00:24:28.766 A:middle
a web page to log in against.

00:24:29.346 --> 00:24:31.386 A:middle
And the user will enter
their credentials,

00:24:32.696 --> 00:24:34.816 A:middle
log in and accept
or deny the request.

00:24:35.536 --> 00:24:38.316 A:middle
And then be sent
back over to the app.

00:24:38.316 --> 00:24:40.986 A:middle
At that point the website is
going to remember that token

00:24:41.276 --> 00:24:43.996 A:middle
and know whether it was
approved or denied for use.

00:24:44.126 --> 00:24:46.046 A:middle
And when the app
wants to connect

00:24:46.046 --> 00:24:47.196 A:middle
to that third-party service

00:24:47.196 --> 00:24:49.936 A:middle
in the future it will
do it using that token.

00:24:50.496 --> 00:24:55.586 A:middle
The major goal of a
scheme like this is

00:24:55.586 --> 00:24:57.346 A:middle
to protect a user's credentials

00:24:57.986 --> 00:24:59.696 A:middle
so that an app doesn't
have to remember them.



00:25:00.236 --> 00:25:01.676 A:middle
Instead the app gets a token.

00:25:02.686 --> 00:25:05.926 A:middle
That token can be used at a
later date to request resources

00:25:06.546 --> 00:25:09.296 A:middle
or the user could revoke
the token without having

00:25:09.296 --> 00:25:10.316 A:middle
to change their password.

00:25:10.826 --> 00:25:11.916 A:middle
This is great for users.

00:25:13.086 --> 00:25:14.836 A:middle
If you are implementing
this today,

00:25:14.906 --> 00:25:19.306 A:middle
you are probably using
UIWebView or WKWebView to do it.

00:25:19.516 --> 00:25:20.586 A:middle
But I'm happy to tell you

00:25:20.986 --> 00:25:24.396 A:middle
that Safari View Controller
is great for this purpose.

00:25:24.536 --> 00:25:26.386 A:middle
It's awesome for
web-based authentication.

00:25:26.386 --> 00:25:30.066 A:middle
One of the reasons it is awesome

00:25:30.066 --> 00:25:32.686 A:middle
for web-based authentication
is the security story.

00:25:33.456 --> 00:25:35.696 A:middle
It's just as secure
as Safari itself.

00:25:36.576 --> 00:25:39.496 A:middle
Because it runs out of process,
and Apple will never get

00:25:39.496 --> 00:25:41.056 A:middle
to see a user's user name

00:25:41.326 --> 00:25:43.046 A:middle
and password while
they're logging in.

00:25:43.046 --> 00:25:45.996 A:middle
And when it comes to
protecting a user's data,

00:25:46.646 --> 00:25:50.026 A:middle
one of the best ways to do
that is never to have access

00:25:50.026 --> 00:25:51.016 A:middle
to it in the first place.

00:25:51.786 --> 00:25:53.556 A:middle
That's our approach
whenever possible at Apple.

00:25:54.086 --> 00:25:57.056 A:middle
But it is also an
awesome user story.

00:25:58.026 --> 00:26:00.816 A:middle
Because since Safari View
Controller has access



00:25:58.026 --> 00:26:00.816 A:middle
Because since Safari View
Controller has access

00:26:00.816 --> 00:26:04.436 A:middle
to a user's credentials, synced
across all of their devices

00:26:04.436 --> 00:26:07.286 A:middle
with iCloud Keychain, logging
in is going to be a breeze.

00:26:07.746 --> 00:26:09.916 A:middle
They may not need
to use Autofill.

00:26:10.316 --> 00:26:11.396 A:middle
They might already be logged

00:26:11.396 --> 00:26:12.986 A:middle
into that third-party
web service.

00:26:15.616 --> 00:26:19.466 A:middle
Simply put, users will be much
more likely to authenticate

00:26:19.466 --> 00:26:21.086 A:middle
against that third-party
web service,

00:26:21.176 --> 00:26:24.186 A:middle
if you are using Safari View
Controller compared to something

00:26:24.186 --> 00:26:24.966 A:middle
that you rolled yourself.

00:26:26.176 --> 00:26:28.836 A:middle
And I'm happy to say this
is also super easy to adopt.

00:26:29.356 --> 00:26:30.446 A:middle
It takes two steps.

00:26:32.916 --> 00:26:37.196 A:middle
The first is where you would've
used your own in-app browser,

00:26:37.766 --> 00:26:40.656 A:middle
just present an instance
of SFSafariViewController.

00:26:41.746 --> 00:26:43.516 A:middle
And once the user is
finished logging in

00:26:44.066 --> 00:26:48.046 A:middle
and the third-party web service
redirects back to your app

00:26:48.386 --> 00:26:51.926 A:middle
with the custom URL scheme
that you fed it, you can accept

00:26:51.976 --> 00:26:54.776 A:middle
that in your AppDelegate's
handleOpenURL method.

00:26:55.556 --> 00:26:57.526 A:middle
From there you can
inspect the response

00:26:58.146 --> 00:27:01.036 A:middle
and dismiss the instance
of SFSafariViewController



00:26:58.146 --> 00:27:01.036 A:middle
and dismiss the instance
of SFSafariViewController

00:27:01.416 --> 00:27:03.226 A:middle
because you know that the
authentication is done.

00:27:04.426 --> 00:27:05.116 A:middle
That's it.

00:27:05.556 --> 00:27:06.206 A:middle
Two steps.

00:27:06.916 --> 00:27:10.206 A:middle
And you've replaced your in-app
browser with one that has all

00:27:10.206 --> 00:27:11.396 A:middle
of the user's user names

00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:13.436 A:middle
and passwords available
for Autofill.

00:27:14.016 --> 00:27:16.116 A:middle
Users are going to be delighted
by this and you are going

00:27:16.116 --> 00:27:18.836 A:middle
to have more users log into
that third-party web service.

00:27:19.336 --> 00:27:26.746 A:middle
Okay, let's cover everything
we talked about today.

00:27:26.936 --> 00:27:29.876 A:middle
Web content is everywhere
and it comes

00:27:29.876 --> 00:27:31.656 A:middle
in all sorts of shapes
and sizes.

00:27:33.096 --> 00:27:36.206 A:middle
But if you are using it within
your app in a custom way

00:27:36.236 --> 00:27:40.636 A:middle
where you own the experience
or you're customizing it,

00:27:40.636 --> 00:27:42.746 A:middle
WKWebView is the right
tool for the job.

00:27:44.096 --> 00:27:46.546 A:middle
You might still be using
the older UIWebView,

00:27:47.216 --> 00:27:48.986 A:middle
but WKWebView is modern

00:27:49.396 --> 00:27:51.636 A:middle
and includes the
modern JavaScript engine

00:27:51.826 --> 00:27:54.686 A:middle
that Safari itself
uses, it's much faster.

00:27:55.496 --> 00:27:59.096 A:middle
And now in iOS 9
and OS X El Capitan,

00:27:59.816 --> 00:28:01.546 A:middle
it has much more
flexibility for you.



00:27:59.816 --> 00:28:01.546 A:middle
it has much more
flexibility for you.

00:28:03.196 --> 00:28:05.866 A:middle
If you'd like to learn more
about adopting WKWebView,

00:28:06.136 --> 00:28:07.376 A:middle
you can see last year's session,

00:28:08.346 --> 00:28:09.866 A:middle
Introducing the Modern
WebKit API.

00:28:10.526 --> 00:28:14.776 A:middle
But if your task with
web content is different,

00:28:15.876 --> 00:28:19.696 A:middle
if your task is to show a
website when a user taps

00:28:19.696 --> 00:28:23.596 A:middle
on a link, your use case and
needs are completely different.

00:28:24.856 --> 00:28:27.876 A:middle
In the past, you may have built
your own in-app web browser

00:28:27.876 --> 00:28:31.866 A:middle
with UIWebView or WKWebView,
but that's always had downsides,

00:28:32.856 --> 00:28:34.416 A:middle
it didn't have any
of the features

00:28:34.716 --> 00:28:36.096 A:middle
or state that Safari has.

00:28:36.976 --> 00:28:38.926 A:middle
And more likely than
not through no fault

00:28:38.926 --> 00:28:41.896 A:middle
of your own your app's
implementation was different

00:28:41.896 --> 00:28:44.266 A:middle
than that of other apps
that the user has installed,

00:28:44.896 --> 00:28:46.946 A:middle
which leads to a confusing
experience sometimes.

00:28:47.546 --> 00:28:50.086 A:middle
Your first option forgetting

00:28:50.086 --> 00:28:53.466 A:middle
out of the scenario is
delegating the responsibility

00:28:53.466 --> 00:28:56.056 A:middle
of showing web content
to Safari itself.

00:28:56.666 --> 00:28:58.316 A:middle
And the system wide
ability to go back

00:28:58.436 --> 00:29:00.566 A:middle
to the last app makes
this much better



00:28:58.436 --> 00:29:00.566 A:middle
to the last app makes
this much better

00:29:00.566 --> 00:29:01.606 A:middle
than it has ever been before.

00:29:02.116 --> 00:29:05.236 A:middle
But if you would like to
maintain your current user

00:29:05.236 --> 00:29:08.916 A:middle
experience where users
never leave your app,

00:29:08.916 --> 00:29:12.836 A:middle
Safari View Controller will add
years of features and polish

00:29:13.276 --> 00:29:15.176 A:middle
and features and
polish in the future.

00:29:16.206 --> 00:29:19.476 A:middle
For you, it'll mean having
more time to work on the parts

00:29:19.476 --> 00:29:21.426 A:middle
of your app that are
special about your app,

00:29:21.916 --> 00:29:23.256 A:middle
the parts that you
want to work on.

00:29:23.286 --> 00:29:26.716 A:middle
For your users, it will
mean having new features

00:29:27.296 --> 00:29:31.276 A:middle
like Safari Autofill, Safari
Reader and Content Blocking.

00:29:31.836 --> 00:29:37.356 A:middle
And while I still have your
attention I have a quick favor

00:29:37.356 --> 00:29:39.296 A:middle
to ask of you.

00:29:39.506 --> 00:29:42.926 A:middle
Please keep filing bugs
and feature requests,

00:29:43.336 --> 00:29:47.656 A:middle
when there is a gap between what
is and what you think should be

00:29:48.096 --> 00:29:49.756 A:middle
on the platforms that
you are developing on.

00:29:50.726 --> 00:29:54.046 A:middle
One of the reasons that Safari
View Controller exists is

00:29:54.046 --> 00:29:56.326 A:middle
because so many of you
told us that you wanted it.

00:29:57.406 --> 00:29:59.686 A:middle
And now that it does
exist as you're trying it

00:29:59.686 --> 00:30:00.946 A:middle
out over the next few months,



00:29:59.686 --> 00:30:00.946 A:middle
out over the next few months,

00:30:01.396 --> 00:30:04.976 A:middle
please let us know how we can
make it more useful to you.

00:30:05.056 --> 00:30:08.866 A:middle
We really do appreciate
your feedback.

00:30:09.866 --> 00:30:11.206 A:middle
Okay. You can get
more information

00:30:11.206 --> 00:30:13.866 A:middle
about anything we covered
today at the usual places.

00:30:14.436 --> 00:30:16.746 A:middle
Or you can hit up
John Davis, the Safari

00:30:16.746 --> 00:30:17.796 A:middle
and WebKit Evangelist.

00:30:18.156 --> 00:30:21.856 A:middle
And we have some
related sessions

00:30:21.856 --> 00:30:22.906 A:middle
that you might be interested in.

00:30:24.106 --> 00:30:27.106 A:middle
To call out two in
particular, in Seamless Linking

00:30:27.106 --> 00:30:30.386 A:middle
to Your App you'll learn about
Apple's solution to the problem

00:30:30.606 --> 00:30:31.676 A:middle
of inner app linking

00:30:32.296 --> 00:30:34.556 A:middle
which involves taking
your website's URLs

00:30:35.186 --> 00:30:37.906 A:middle
and making them universal,
allowing them to open your app

00:30:38.566 --> 00:30:40.016 A:middle
on your users' iOS devices.

00:30:40.646 --> 00:30:41.286 A:middle
It's really cool.

00:30:42.206 --> 00:30:44.796 A:middle
In Safari Extensibility,
you'll learn to write one

00:30:44.796 --> 00:30:46.816 A:middle
of those content blockers
that I mentioned earlier,

00:30:47.296 --> 00:30:50.216 A:middle
that will apply to all pages
that are loaded in either Safari

00:30:51.026 --> 00:30:52.466 A:middle
or in Safari View Controller.

00:30:52.966 --> 00:30:57.266 A:middle
If you want help with anything
I covered today, the Safari

00:30:57.266 --> 00:30:58.936 A:middle
and WebKit Labs are
the right place to go.

00:30:58.936 --> 00:31:00.616 A:middle
And the first one is happening



00:30:58.936 --> 00:31:00.616 A:middle
And the first one is happening

00:31:00.616 --> 00:31:03.136 A:middle
in about a half an
hour in Media Lab A.

00:31:04.536 --> 00:31:06.376 A:middle
Alright, thank you
so much everybody.

00:31:06.566 --> 00:31:08.336 A:middle
I hope you have a
fantastic WWDC.

00:31:10.516 --> 00:31:23.690 A:middle
