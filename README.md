##WWDC 2015 英文字幕

iOS 开发者的春节到了，我也例行的创建了这个 Repo，在未来数日内会更新所有 WWDC 2015 的视频字幕。

Why have the SRT files?
I use VLC or other video players to create a playlist and randomly loop the videos on a big screen in our office for all our developers to watch. You just need to drop the SRT files with the same name as your MP4 files downloaded from Apple in the same folder. Make sure the file names are the same. VLC and most video players will just pick it up and display the subtitles correctly.
