(Applause)

00:00:26.956 --> 00:00:30.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Qasid Sadiq,

00:00:32.305 --> 00:00:36.796 A:middle
and I am on the Apple
Accessibility team.

00:00:37.096 --> 00:00:39.436 A:middle
Welcome to Accessibility
on the Watch.

00:00:41.036 --> 00:00:41.936 A:middle
Before we get into that,

00:00:41.936 --> 00:00:45.816 A:middle
let's talk a little bit
about accessibility.

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:51.166 A:middle
As you know, there are many
different kinds of users,

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:55.426 A:middle
and as you can imagine, these
users have many different ways

00:00:55.426 --> 00:00:56.546 A:middle
of interacting with the world.

00:00:56.546 --> 00:00:59.496 A:middle
But for the sake of our
conversation, we are going

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:03.906 A:middle
to focus on a certain subset of
these users, users, for example,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:03.906 A:middle
to focus on a certain subset of
these users, users, for example,

00:01:03.906 --> 00:01:06.106 A:middle
who are visually impaired
or hard of hearing.

00:01:09.226 --> 00:01:12.216 A:middle
As developers, these
users present us

00:01:12.216 --> 00:01:13.596 A:middle
with a very special opportunity.

00:01:14.326 --> 00:01:15.666 A:middle
It's something that's
unique to us.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:19.436 A:middle
It's the opportunity to not
only accommodate these groups

00:01:19.436 --> 00:01:24.006 A:middle
of individuals, but to also
really enable and empower them

00:01:24.786 --> 00:01:28.696 A:middle
to do things they otherwise
might not have been able to do.

00:01:28.926 --> 00:01:31.336 A:middle
Now, all of you are here
because you guys are creating

00:01:31.336 --> 00:01:35.326 A:middle
applications which will allow
people to do amazing things.

00:01:36.356 --> 00:01:38.266 A:middle
So let's let everyone
do those amazing things,

00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:40.016 A:middle
regardless of who they are

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:44.306 A:middle
or how they interact
with the world.

00:01:44.306 --> 00:01:48.376 A:middle
Now, Apple is committed to
this idea, and this is evident

00:01:48.376 --> 00:01:52.106 A:middle
through our accessibility
features on iOS and OS X,

00:01:52.496 --> 00:01:57.096 A:middle
things like VoiceOver, Switch
Control, Assistive Touch, Zoom,

00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:00.206 A:middle
Guided Access, and
so on and so forth.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:00.206 A:middle
Guided Access, and
so on and so forth.

00:02:01.096 --> 00:02:02.346 A:middle
The Apple Watch is no different.

00:02:03.396 --> 00:02:05.686 A:middle
We try our hardest to make
this device accessible

00:02:05.686 --> 00:02:07.336 A:middle
to as many users as possible.

00:02:08.015 --> 00:02:09.116 A:middle
So let's get into that.

00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:12.506 A:middle
Now, first we are going to talk
about what is accessibility

00:02:12.506 --> 00:02:15.626 A:middle
on the Apple Watch, who
it's for, how it works,

00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:18.866 A:middle
then I want to tell you guys
about how you, as developers,

00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:20.386 A:middle
can make your WatchKit
apps accessible,

00:02:20.386 --> 00:02:23.876 A:middle
and you guys will get to
see those APIs in action.

00:02:25.476 --> 00:02:27.406 A:middle
Finally, we will round
it out with a few tips

00:02:27.406 --> 00:02:28.416 A:middle
and tricks you should consider

00:02:28.416 --> 00:02:30.576 A:middle
when you are designing your
accessibility experience.

00:02:31.076 --> 00:02:34.776 A:middle
Let's talk about the
accessibility features,

00:02:34.776 --> 00:02:37.386 A:middle
starting with VoiceOver.

00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:42.796 A:middle
Now, VoiceOver is an alternate
interface for blind users.

00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:44.746 A:middle
The idea behind it is simple.

00:02:45.706 --> 00:02:47.516 A:middle
VoiceOver simply
reads out whatever is

00:02:47.516 --> 00:02:48.536 A:middle
under the user's finger.

00:02:49.286 --> 00:02:52.256 A:middle
So for example, if my
finger is on the Clock icon,

00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:55.336 A:middle
VoiceOver will read out "clock."

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:58.646 A:middle
Additionally, we provide a
set of gestures so it's easy

00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:00.216 A:middle
for a VoiceOver user to safely

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:00.216 A:middle
for a VoiceOver user to safely

00:03:00.216 --> 00:03:01.996 A:middle
and effectively navigate
an interface.

00:03:01.996 --> 00:03:03.726 A:middle
I am going to demo
this later on.

00:03:03.726 --> 00:03:08.146 A:middle
Now, for low-vision
users, we have Zoom.

00:03:08.556 --> 00:03:10.456 A:middle
Just like you can
imagine, Zoom allows you

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:11.676 A:middle
to zoom into an interface.

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:15.456 A:middle
On top of that, we provide a set
of two finger gestures inspired

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:17.796 A:middle
by the iOS zoom gestures
and utilize the Crown

00:03:18.316 --> 00:03:20.526 A:middle
to really make it
seamless and easy

00:03:20.526 --> 00:03:21.846 A:middle
to navigate a zoomed interface.

00:03:21.846 --> 00:03:23.546 A:middle
I am going to demo
that, too, later.

00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:30.686 A:middle
In the same vain as Zoom, there
is the X-Large watch face.

00:03:31.096 --> 00:03:34.846 A:middle
This provides large, simple,
uncluttered readout of the time,

00:03:35.456 --> 00:03:37.296 A:middle
so it's easy for a user
to pick up their wrist

00:03:37.296 --> 00:03:41.086 A:middle
and determine what time it is.

00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:45.186 A:middle
Now, the Apple Watch
has a compact screen,

00:03:45.276 --> 00:03:48.276 A:middle
and although the fonts go a long
way in terms of readability,

00:03:48.716 --> 00:03:50.716 A:middle
some users may need to
increase the text size.

00:03:51.056 --> 00:03:54.266 A:middle
For these users, we have the
text size slider and settings.

00:03:54.666 --> 00:04:00.196 A:middle
Now, for users with certain
light and color sensitivities,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:54.666 --> 00:04:00.196 A:middle
Now, for users with certain
light and color sensitivities,

00:04:00.196 --> 00:04:02.156 A:middle
there's a Grayscale
switch, which filters the UI

00:04:02.156 --> 00:04:04.756 A:middle
across the whole Watch to
be completely grayscale.

00:04:05.386 --> 00:04:08.246 A:middle
This creates a much easier to
read and undistracting interface

00:04:08.246 --> 00:04:09.436 A:middle
for these particular users.

00:04:11.896 --> 00:04:14.916 A:middle
Now, certain users have
trouble reading interfaces

00:04:14.916 --> 00:04:15.776 A:middle
with blurs on them.

00:04:15.916 --> 00:04:17.966 A:middle
Either the contrast
isn't high enough

00:04:18.476 --> 00:04:20.505 A:middle
or there's distracting
blur or artifacts.

00:04:20.736 --> 00:04:23.816 A:middle
For these users, we have the
Reduce Transparency switch.

00:04:25.076 --> 00:04:28.166 A:middle
This removes transparency from
screens like Notification Center

00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:31.976 A:middle
and Siri so a user can much more
easily read what's happening

00:04:31.976 --> 00:04:32.716 A:middle
on these screens.

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:37.846 A:middle
Then there's Reduce Motion.

00:04:38.616 --> 00:04:40.666 A:middle
This reduces movement on
the screen all around,

00:04:40.666 --> 00:04:42.486 A:middle
and where movement is
absolutely necessary,

00:04:42.486 --> 00:04:45.496 A:middle
makes it directly correlated
with the user's action.

00:04:46.276 --> 00:04:49.646 A:middle
An example of this is on the
transition from the clock face

00:04:49.786 --> 00:04:52.466 A:middle
to the Home screen, where
instead of zooming in to icons,

00:04:52.466 --> 00:04:53.736 A:middle
we simply have it appear.

00:04:56.306 --> 00:04:58.866 A:middle
This creates a much more
orienting experience

00:04:58.866 --> 00:04:59.806 A:middle
for certain users.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:06.696 --> 00:05:10.326 A:middle
Finally, users with hearing
issues can adjust the left/right

00:05:10.326 --> 00:05:13.796 A:middle
balance and set mono-audio on
their Bluetooth-paired headsets

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:15.226 A:middle
with their Apple Watch.

00:05:16.676 --> 00:05:17.866 A:middle
So let's see these in action.

00:05:40.026 --> 00:05:43.856 A:middle
Okay. So let's start
with VoiceOver.

00:05:44.586 --> 00:05:46.246 A:middle
You can turn on VoiceOver
one of three ways.

00:05:46.416 --> 00:05:49.706 A:middle
You can use the Apple Watch app
on the iPhone, the Settings app

00:05:49.706 --> 00:05:52.326 A:middle
on the Apple Watch, or
if you have it assigned

00:05:52.326 --> 00:05:54.456 A:middle
in the Apple Watch app,
an Accessibility shortcut.

00:05:54.936 --> 00:05:56.706 A:middle
This allows you to simply
triple-click the Crown

00:05:56.706 --> 00:05:57.746 A:middle
to turn VoiceOver on..

00:05:58.566 --> 00:05:59.766 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: VoiceOver on.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:00.016 --> 00:06:00.416 A:middle
Weather.

00:06:01.656 --> 00:06:04.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; QASID SADIQ: To
demonstrate how VoiceOver works,

00:06:04.056 --> 00:06:05.536 A:middle
let's try to do something
with VoiceOver.

00:06:05.536 --> 00:06:07.566 A:middle
Let's try to find out what
time it is in New York.

00:06:08.226 --> 00:06:10.966 A:middle
Before anything else, we have
to get a sense of where we are

00:06:10.966 --> 00:06:13.406 A:middle
on screen, and a good
way of doing that is

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:16.376 A:middle
by placing your finger on
screen and having VoiceOver read

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.586 A:middle
out whatever is under
your finger.

00:06:17.586 --> 00:06:19.476 A:middle
I am going to go
ahead and do that.

00:06:22.486 --> 00:06:23.356 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Calendar.

00:06:24.106 --> 00:06:25.876 A:middle
Music. Maps.

00:06:26.566 --> 00:06:27.146 A:middle
Alarm.

00:06:29.206 --> 00:06:31.016 A:middle
&gt;&gt; QASID SADIQ: So now
I actually have a sense

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:32.146 A:middle
of where I am on screen.

00:06:32.316 --> 00:06:33.986 A:middle
And I want to move through
these elements and get

00:06:33.986 --> 00:06:37.046 A:middle
to the World Clock app icon so
I can open that application.

00:06:37.106 --> 00:06:40.746 A:middle
Now, the way a VoiceOver user
moves through these elements is

00:06:40.746 --> 00:06:43.886 A:middle
by swiping right to move to the
next element or by swiping left

00:06:43.886 --> 00:06:44.996 A:middle
to move to the previous element.

00:06:44.996 --> 00:06:46.966 A:middle
So I am going to go
ahead and swipe right

00:06:47.066 --> 00:06:48.996 A:middle
until VoiceOver speaks
World Clock,

00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:53.286 A:middle
indicating that it is focused
on the World Clock app icon.

00:06:53.406 --> 00:06:55.706 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: World clock.

00:06:55.846 --> 00:06:56.866 A:middle
World clock.

00:06:56.866 --> 00:06:58.466 A:middle
Stop -- world Clock.

00:06:59.806 --> 00:07:01.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; QASID SADIQ: Now
VoiceOver spoke "World Clock."

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.806 --> 00:07:01.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; QASID SADIQ: Now
VoiceOver spoke "World Clock."

00:07:01.806 --> 00:07:03.706 A:middle
That means I am focused
on World Clock.

00:07:04.386 --> 00:07:07.316 A:middle
Now to actually open the app I
need to activate the element,

00:07:07.316 --> 00:07:08.366 A:middle
and to activate the element,

00:07:08.366 --> 00:07:10.326 A:middle
I can double-tap
anywhere on screen.

00:07:12.756 --> 00:07:17.336 A:middle
So let's wait for this to load.

00:07:18.326 --> 00:07:19.726 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: World Clock.

00:07:21.656 --> 00:07:23.766 A:middle
World Clock.

00:07:23.766 --> 00:07:25.356 A:middle
Back. Cupertino.

00:07:25.476 --> 00:07:27.856 A:middle
1:37 p.m. Today.

00:07:28.576 --> 00:07:31.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; QASID SADIQ: Now, I want
to find out what time it is

00:07:31.086 --> 00:07:33.436 A:middle
in New York, and since
this is my Watch,

00:07:33.766 --> 00:07:35.676 A:middle
I know that New York is at
the bottom of this list,

00:07:35.796 --> 00:07:37.276 A:middle
so I can simply scroll
to the bottom.

00:07:37.956 --> 00:07:40.536 A:middle
The way a VoiceOver user scrolls
is by placing two fingers

00:07:40.536 --> 00:07:43.456 A:middle
on screen and scrolling
in the direction --

00:07:43.456 --> 00:07:44.806 A:middle
or flicking in the
direction of the scroll.

00:07:44.806 --> 00:07:49.006 A:middle
So I want to go ahead and do
that until I get to the bottom.

00:07:49.166 --> 00:07:50.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Rows 4 to 7.

00:07:50.426 --> 00:07:52.346 A:middle
Row 6 -- row 7.

00:07:54.306 --> 00:07:57.626 A:middle
New York. 4:38 p.m. Today.

00:07:57.966 --> 00:07:58.886 A:middle
Plus 3 hours.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:00.136 --> 00:08:01.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; QASID SADIQ: Now I know
what time it is in New York.

00:08:02.216 --> 00:08:03.206 A:middle
So that's VoiceOver.

00:08:03.206 --> 00:08:05.716 A:middle
Now let's go ahead
and look at Zoom.

00:08:05.926 --> 00:08:08.156 A:middle
To first things first, I
have to turn VoiceOver off,

00:08:08.156 --> 00:08:10.326 A:middle
and I can use my Accessibility
shortcut to turn it off

00:08:10.326 --> 00:08:11.446 A:middle
by triple-tapping the Crown.

00:08:12.566 --> 00:08:14.156 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: VoiceOver off.

00:08:14.566 --> 00:08:16.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; QASID SADIQ: And all the
Accessibility settings are

00:08:16.066 --> 00:08:16.636 A:middle
in Settings.

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:17.916 A:middle
Accessibility.

00:08:19.256 --> 00:08:24.676 A:middle
Zoom. Now, I want
to read this text,

00:08:24.676 --> 00:08:25.756 A:middle
and it's actually a bit small,

00:08:25.756 --> 00:08:27.406 A:middle
so it seems like a good
place I can zoom in.

00:08:28.196 --> 00:08:29.786 A:middle
So to zoom in with Zoom,

00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:31.886 A:middle
you simply two-finger
double-tap on screen.

00:08:36.556 --> 00:08:38.346 A:middle
Now that I am zoomed
in, I actually want

00:08:38.346 --> 00:08:39.666 A:middle
to adjust the zoom level a bit.

00:08:40.196 --> 00:08:41.166 A:middle
To adjust the zoom level,

00:08:41.525 --> 00:08:43.956 A:middle
I simply two-finger
double-tap and scroll.

00:08:49.816 --> 00:08:51.936 A:middle
So that's perfect.

00:08:52.206 --> 00:08:55.276 A:middle
Now I have to move
the zoom focus

00:08:55.276 --> 00:08:56.836 A:middle
around so I can actually
read this text.

00:08:57.366 --> 00:08:59.596 A:middle
Now, I can use a two-finger
pan gesture, which is similar

00:08:59.596 --> 00:09:02.466 A:middle
to the iOS pan gesture in
Zoom to move this around,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:59.596 --> 00:09:02.466 A:middle
to the iOS pan gesture in
Zoom to move this around,

00:09:03.416 --> 00:09:05.136 A:middle
but there is an issue with this.

00:09:05.616 --> 00:09:07.776 A:middle
It's a bit slow, and also
my fingers are in the way

00:09:07.776 --> 00:09:09.636 A:middle
of what I am trying to read.

00:09:09.636 --> 00:09:11.966 A:middle
Just for this problem, we have
actually utilized the Crown

00:09:11.966 --> 00:09:13.846 A:middle
to allow you to move
the zoom focus around.

00:09:13.846 --> 00:09:16.286 A:middle
If I rotate the Crown forward,

00:09:16.586 --> 00:09:20.296 A:middle
it takes me from left
to right, like so.

00:09:20.296 --> 00:09:25.276 A:middle
Once I hit the end of the line,
it takes me to the next line.

00:09:26.876 --> 00:09:28.586 A:middle
Similarly, if I rotate
it backwards,

00:09:28.586 --> 00:09:30.486 A:middle
it does the exact
reverse of that.

00:09:34.946 --> 00:09:35.666 A:middle
There you go.

00:09:36.496 --> 00:09:37.056 A:middle
That's Zoom.

00:09:49.926 --> 00:09:53.096 A:middle
Now, as you can see, the
Apple Watch is quite an

00:09:53.096 --> 00:09:53.946 A:middle
accessible device.

00:09:54.986 --> 00:09:56.616 A:middle
But for it to be
completely accessible,

00:09:56.616 --> 00:09:58.926 A:middle
it needs to have
accessible applications.

00:09:58.926 --> 00:10:00.596 A:middle
This is where you come in.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:58.926 --> 00:10:00.596 A:middle
This is where you come in.

00:10:01.646 --> 00:10:03.736 A:middle
This is where you really
get to be the champions

00:10:03.736 --> 00:10:06.816 A:middle
of accessibility and the
champions of our VoiceOver users

00:10:07.176 --> 00:10:08.746 A:middle
by making your applications
accessible.

00:10:08.786 --> 00:10:11.386 A:middle
And the way you make your
applications accessible is

00:10:11.386 --> 00:10:13.016 A:middle
through our WatchKit
Accessibility API.

00:10:15.186 --> 00:10:17.646 A:middle
For the most part, this
is actually a relatively

00:10:17.646 --> 00:10:18.356 A:middle
simple task.

00:10:18.816 --> 00:10:20.846 A:middle
It involves setting a
couple of properties

00:10:20.846 --> 00:10:22.106 A:middle
on a few interface items.

00:10:23.376 --> 00:10:27.716 A:middle
Now, each interface item is a
subclass of WK Interface Object,

00:10:28.196 --> 00:10:30.726 A:middle
and this is exactly where you
annotate your accessibility

00:10:30.726 --> 00:10:33.796 A:middle
information to make these
interface items accessible.

00:10:34.806 --> 00:10:36.996 A:middle
You only need these two
core functions to make most

00:10:36.996 --> 00:10:39.256 A:middle
of your application accessible,
so let's go ahead and talk

00:10:39.256 --> 00:10:41.266 A:middle
about these, starting
with Existence.

00:10:42.476 --> 00:10:45.406 A:middle
Before anything else,
VoiceOver needs to know what is

00:10:45.686 --> 00:10:46.856 A:middle
and what is not an element.

00:10:48.786 --> 00:10:51.096 A:middle
Accessibility elements are those
things that you saw me swiping

00:10:51.096 --> 00:10:52.326 A:middle
through and touching in my demo.

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:55.726 A:middle
Now, by default, our frameworks
give a lot of this to you,

00:10:56.116 --> 00:10:57.856 A:middle
things like buttons, labels,

00:10:57.856 --> 00:10:59.586 A:middle
and switches are all
accessibility elements.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.816 A:middle
But sometimes you might need
to get away from the default.

00:11:02.566 --> 00:11:04.736 A:middle
For example, if you
want to expose an image

00:11:04.736 --> 00:11:06.466 A:middle
which is not an accessibility
element,

00:11:06.676 --> 00:11:09.786 A:middle
that presents valuable
information to the user.

00:11:10.866 --> 00:11:13.766 A:middle
Or if you want to group together
a few accessibility elements

00:11:13.766 --> 00:11:15.516 A:middle
to make it easy for
your VoiceOver user

00:11:15.516 --> 00:11:16.456 A:middle
to navigate the screen.

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:18.916 A:middle
Like we did here in
the Conversation group,

00:11:19.506 --> 00:11:21.156 A:middle
where we grouped together
those three labels

00:11:21.276 --> 00:11:24.576 A:middle
so that a VoiceOver user does
not have to swipe three times

00:11:24.576 --> 00:11:25.866 A:middle
to get past one Conversation.

00:11:26.366 --> 00:11:29.016 A:middle
You can set this
by passing a bool

00:11:29.016 --> 00:11:32.006 A:middle
into the function set
Is Accessibility Element

00:11:32.806 --> 00:11:33.686 A:middle
on an interface item.

00:11:37.296 --> 00:11:41.176 A:middle
The way a VoiceOver user
sees what's on screen is

00:11:41.176 --> 00:11:43.236 A:middle
by hearing a short
description of that element.

00:11:45.166 --> 00:11:48.216 A:middle
This short description is
called an accessibility label.

00:11:50.296 --> 00:11:52.176 A:middle
Now, just like Is
Accessibility Element,

00:11:52.216 --> 00:11:53.696 A:middle
a lot of this is
determined for you.

00:11:55.576 --> 00:11:59.706 A:middle
Accessibility infers a label
by doing things like looking

00:11:59.806 --> 00:12:03.566 A:middle
at the text contained inside an
interface item, but sometimes

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.806 --> 00:12:03.566 A:middle
at the text contained inside an
interface item, but sometimes

00:12:03.776 --> 00:12:07.236 A:middle
that inferred label may be
misleading or nonexistent.

00:12:07.236 --> 00:12:09.446 A:middle
An example of that
is a Home screen,

00:12:09.656 --> 00:12:11.416 A:middle
where each of these app
icons are not associated

00:12:11.416 --> 00:12:12.126 A:middle
with any text.

00:12:12.826 --> 00:12:14.156 A:middle
In these particular situations,

00:12:14.756 --> 00:12:17.006 A:middle
you have to set the
Aaccessibility label yourself.

00:12:17.006 --> 00:12:20.256 A:middle
And the way you do that
is by passing a string

00:12:20.256 --> 00:12:20.996 A:middle
into the function,

00:12:21.106 --> 00:12:23.356 A:middle
et Accessibility Label,
on an interface item.

00:12:25.526 --> 00:12:28.926 A:middle
So now these apps will get you
90 percent of the way in terms

00:12:28.926 --> 00:12:30.556 A:middle
of making your application
accessible --

00:12:30.556 --> 00:12:31.546 A:middle
or these functions, sorry.

00:12:32.956 --> 00:12:35.806 A:middle
But to really complete your
accessibility experience,

00:12:35.806 --> 00:12:39.336 A:middle
you should try to use
these three functions too.

00:12:39.616 --> 00:12:40.476 A:middle
Let's talk about these.

00:12:41.936 --> 00:12:44.576 A:middle
Now, you might remember
VoiceOver saying certain things

00:12:44.576 --> 00:12:47.476 A:middle
like "button" or
"adjustable" or "not enabled."

00:12:48.256 --> 00:12:50.626 A:middle
What's actually happening
here is

00:12:51.436 --> 00:12:54.046 A:middle
that each accessibility
element is associated

00:12:54.046 --> 00:12:54.966 A:middle
with a set of traits.

00:12:56.226 --> 00:12:57.886 A:middle
These traits let
VoiceOver know how

00:12:57.886 --> 00:12:59.446 A:middle
to present an element
to the user.

00:12:59.986 --> 00:13:04.496 A:middle
An example of where we
use this was actually

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.986 --> 00:13:04.496 A:middle
An example of where we
use this was actually

00:13:04.496 --> 00:13:08.776 A:middle
on the Conversation group,
where we added the button trait

00:13:08.776 --> 00:13:10.966 A:middle
so that a VoiceOver
knows they can double-tap

00:13:10.966 --> 00:13:12.246 A:middle
and activate this element.

00:13:12.736 --> 00:13:14.526 A:middle
The way you set traits
is by passing a bit mask

00:13:14.526 --> 00:13:16.326 A:middle
into the function Set
Accessibility Traits

00:13:16.386 --> 00:13:17.206 A:middle
on an interface item.

00:13:20.616 --> 00:13:24.736 A:middle
Now, sometimes the label and the
traits are not enough to express

00:13:24.736 --> 00:13:27.176 A:middle
to the user exactly
what an element does.

00:13:27.176 --> 00:13:29.816 A:middle
For these particular
situations, it might be useful

00:13:29.816 --> 00:13:33.046 A:middle
to use an accessibility hint,
which is a string spoken

00:13:33.046 --> 00:13:34.466 A:middle
out after the label is spoken

00:13:34.956 --> 00:13:36.786 A:middle
that lets the user
know what they could do

00:13:36.786 --> 00:13:37.956 A:middle
when they are focused
on an element.

00:13:38.866 --> 00:13:41.076 A:middle
You can set an accessibility
hint by passing a string

00:13:41.076 --> 00:13:43.036 A:middle
into the function Set
Accessibility Hint

00:13:43.236 --> 00:13:44.036 A:middle
on an interface item.

00:13:44.036 --> 00:13:49.266 A:middle
Now, certain elements are
associated with a value,

00:13:49.266 --> 00:13:51.336 A:middle
which change quite often
throughout the lifecycle

00:13:51.336 --> 00:13:51.966 A:middle
of that element.

00:13:52.456 --> 00:13:56.536 A:middle
An example of this is the
Minute Picker and the Timer app,

00:13:56.536 --> 00:13:58.226 A:middle
where that value is the number

00:13:58.226 --> 00:13:59.936 A:middle
of minutes that's
currently selected.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:00.416 --> 00:14:02.686 A:middle
For this particular situation,

00:14:02.686 --> 00:14:04.676 A:middle
we have something called
an Accessibility Value.

00:14:05.676 --> 00:14:07.856 A:middle
This is something that's spoken
out after the label is read out

00:14:07.856 --> 00:14:09.366 A:middle
or anytime the value changes.

00:14:09.926 --> 00:14:11.616 A:middle
You can set this
by passing a string

00:14:11.616 --> 00:14:13.676 A:middle
into the function Set
Accessibility Value

00:14:13.856 --> 00:14:14.706 A:middle
on an interface item.

00:14:16.706 --> 00:14:18.816 A:middle
So these are the core
accessibility functions.

00:14:19.286 --> 00:14:21.066 A:middle
Let's talk about something
a little bit more complex,

00:14:21.546 --> 00:14:22.266 A:middle
image regions.

00:14:22.666 --> 00:14:26.716 A:middle
Now, it's a common pattern
on the Watch to take a bunch

00:14:26.716 --> 00:14:29.196 A:middle
of information, put
that into an image,

00:14:29.196 --> 00:14:30.786 A:middle
and present that to a user.

00:14:30.886 --> 00:14:34.886 A:middle
An example of this is a
weather dial in the Weather app.

00:14:39.376 --> 00:14:41.836 A:middle
We can try to annotate an
accessibility label to this,

00:14:41.836 --> 00:14:42.566 A:middle
but it would be pretty hard

00:14:42.566 --> 00:14:44.696 A:middle
to actually express what's
happening in this image

00:14:44.696 --> 00:14:45.946 A:middle
with a few concise words.

00:14:46.536 --> 00:14:49.586 A:middle
As you can see, there are 11
conditions, each associated

00:14:49.586 --> 00:14:51.636 A:middle
with a time, and there's
a current temperature.

00:14:51.716 --> 00:14:54.236 A:middle
What we really need
here is the ability

00:14:54.236 --> 00:14:56.346 A:middle
to take the relevant regions,

00:14:57.256 --> 00:14:58.726 A:middle
carve them up into
separate regions,

00:14:59.036 --> 00:15:00.596 A:middle
and associate information
with them.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.036 --> 00:15:00.596 A:middle
and associate information
with them.

00:15:01.586 --> 00:15:05.386 A:middle
So for example, one
Condition icon is associated

00:15:05.386 --> 00:15:06.996 A:middle
with 1 a.m., partly cloudy.

00:15:07.556 --> 00:15:12.256 A:middle
You can do this through the
WK accessibility image region

00:15:12.256 --> 00:15:15.166 A:middle
object, where the
region is a CGRect frame,

00:15:16.246 --> 00:15:18.566 A:middle
and the information
is a string label.

00:15:19.616 --> 00:15:21.026 A:middle
You can take an array
of these objects,

00:15:21.116 --> 00:15:23.736 A:middle
pass them into the function
Set Accessibility Image Regions

00:15:23.786 --> 00:15:27.386 A:middle
on an interface item to present
them to a user as a series

00:15:27.386 --> 00:15:28.556 A:middle
of accessibility elements

00:15:28.596 --> 00:15:30.246 A:middle
that they can swipe
through and touch.

00:15:33.386 --> 00:15:38.896 A:middle
Finally, as you are designing
your accessibility application

00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:41.516 A:middle
user experience, you might
come across a situation

00:15:41.516 --> 00:15:43.356 A:middle
where you might need
to adjust the UI a bit

00:15:43.356 --> 00:15:44.546 A:middle
for your VoiceOver users.

00:15:45.266 --> 00:15:46.776 A:middle
And to do that, your
application needs

00:15:46.776 --> 00:15:49.036 A:middle
to know whether VoiceOver
is running or not.

00:15:50.456 --> 00:15:52.426 A:middle
So for this, we add a new API,

00:15:54.056 --> 00:15:56.236 A:middle
WK Accessibility is
VoiceOver running.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:00.016 --> 00:16:01.026 A:middle
Let's see this in action.

00:16:01.556 --> 00:16:05.296 A:middle
So I created an application
which allows you

00:16:05.296 --> 00:16:07.226 A:middle
to order a sandwich
right off of your wrist,

00:16:07.356 --> 00:16:08.776 A:middle
and it's actually
pretty straightforward.

00:16:09.516 --> 00:16:11.466 A:middle
First thing you do is you
actually make your sandwich

00:16:11.866 --> 00:16:14.036 A:middle
by selecting the layers that
you want on your sandwich.

00:16:14.436 --> 00:16:18.496 A:middle
So I want to take some bread,
add some roast beef on top

00:16:18.496 --> 00:16:21.586 A:middle
of that, maybe I'll
have some lettuce,

00:16:21.586 --> 00:16:24.596 A:middle
and end it with some more bread.

00:16:24.596 --> 00:16:30.296 A:middle
And I can go back, see a visual
representation of my sandwich,

00:16:30.796 --> 00:16:34.546 A:middle
and then I can go
ahead and order.

00:16:35.726 --> 00:16:38.306 A:middle
So we want to see if this
application is actually

00:16:38.306 --> 00:16:41.426 A:middle
accessible to all of our users,
especially our VoiceOver users.

00:16:41.856 --> 00:16:44.606 A:middle
And a good way of
actually doing that is

00:16:44.606 --> 00:16:46.336 A:middle
by actually just
turning VoiceOver on

00:16:46.806 --> 00:16:47.906 A:middle
and trying the application out.

00:16:48.476 --> 00:16:50.716 A:middle
So let's turn VoiceOver on with
our Accessibility shortcut.

00:16:51.746 --> 00:16:53.006 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: VoiceOver on.

00:16:53.256 --> 00:16:54.196 A:middle
Make sandwich.

00:16:54.656 --> 00:16:55.086 A:middle
Button.

00:16:55.706 --> 00:16:56.006 A:middle
&gt;&gt; QASID SADIQ: Okay.

00:16:56.836 --> 00:16:58.306 A:middle
So we have one issue right away.

00:16:58.816 --> 00:17:02.086 A:middle
We can see that this image
representation of our sandwich,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:58.816 --> 00:17:02.086 A:middle
We can see that this image
representation of our sandwich,

00:17:02.266 --> 00:17:04.236 A:middle
which presents us valuable
information in terms

00:17:04.236 --> 00:17:06.406 A:middle
of what our sandwich
actually is composed of,

00:17:06.746 --> 00:17:09.266 A:middle
is completely inaccessible, so
we should make this available

00:17:09.266 --> 00:17:10.316 A:middle
to our VoiceOver users.

00:17:11.455 --> 00:17:12.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Make sandwich.

00:17:12.455 --> 00:17:13.856 A:middle
Order. Button.

00:17:14.006 --> 00:17:15.266 A:middle
I button.

00:17:16.606 --> 00:17:18.496 A:middle
&gt;&gt; QASID SADIQ: Now,
although it's obvious to us

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:21.116 A:middle
because we can see this is
an information button based

00:17:21.116 --> 00:17:24.326 A:middle
on the visual cues, a VoiceOver
user will only hear the letter

00:17:24.326 --> 00:17:28.066 A:middle
i, and it could be confusing
as to what this actually does.

00:17:28.066 --> 00:17:30.216 A:middle
We should add an
accessibility label to this

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:32.546 A:middle
that speaks information.

00:17:33.226 --> 00:17:34.546 A:middle
Also, this button
looks a bit small.

00:17:34.546 --> 00:17:36.646 A:middle
If you can imagine, it
might be a bit difficult

00:17:36.646 --> 00:17:37.996 A:middle
for a VoiceOver user
to feel around

00:17:37.996 --> 00:17:39.766 A:middle
and find this information
button.

00:17:41.096 --> 00:17:43.696 A:middle
So for this, we should
actually make it larger

00:17:43.696 --> 00:17:44.746 A:middle
when VoiceOver is running.

00:17:45.226 --> 00:17:47.066 A:middle
Let's go ahead and see.

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:48.006 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Make sandwich.

00:17:49.046 --> 00:17:49.716 A:middle
Make sandwich.

00:17:49.946 --> 00:17:51.736 A:middle
Tap what you want
in your sandwich.

00:17:52.206 --> 00:17:56.976 A:middle
One layer of, roast beef, 210 c.

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:58.166 A:middle
Two layers of.

00:17:58.656 --> 00:17:59.086 A:middle
Button.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:00.086 --> 00:18:05.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; QASID SADIQ: The first issue
is VoiceOver is speaking 210 c,

00:18:05.516 --> 00:18:07.596 A:middle
and VoiceOver speaking
isn't necessarily limited

00:18:07.596 --> 00:18:10.676 A:middle
to the screen space
that our interface is.

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:13.686 A:middle
We should make it
speak 210 calories.

00:18:14.376 --> 00:18:16.266 A:middle
Also, notice we have
to swipe it three times

00:18:16.266 --> 00:18:17.366 A:middle
to get past one layer.

00:18:17.366 --> 00:18:19.806 A:middle
If you can imagine I am
really hungry and want

00:18:19.806 --> 00:18:23.276 A:middle
to make my sandwich right
now, I don't want to have

00:18:23.276 --> 00:18:25.016 A:middle
to swipe three times
to get past one layer.

00:18:25.096 --> 00:18:27.136 A:middle
I have a large sandwich.

00:18:27.686 --> 00:18:31.186 A:middle
We are going to have to fix that
by grouping together each layer.

00:18:32.176 --> 00:18:41.216 A:middle
Let's go ahead and fix that.

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:44.996 A:middle
So you can actually fix a lot of
your accessibility issues just

00:18:44.996 --> 00:18:45.826 A:middle
through the Storyboard.

00:18:45.826 --> 00:18:49.486 A:middle
So let's go ahead and tackle
the Make Sandwich screen first

00:18:49.486 --> 00:18:52.166 A:middle
and fix the grouping
of the elements

00:18:52.166 --> 00:18:54.326 A:middle
in the Make Sandwich screen
so a VoiceOver user only has

00:18:54.326 --> 00:18:55.526 A:middle
to swipe once per layer.

00:18:56.426 --> 00:18:58.166 A:middle
First things first, we
have to find the group

00:18:58.166 --> 00:19:02.376 A:middle
that contains these
three labels.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.166 --> 00:19:02.376 A:middle
that contains these
three labels.

00:19:03.246 --> 00:19:04.426 A:middle
And that's here.

00:19:04.976 --> 00:19:10.186 A:middle
We can go over to the sidebar
and set "Accessibility Enabled."

00:19:11.096 --> 00:19:13.076 A:middle
This turns it into an
accessibility element

00:19:13.076 --> 00:19:15.006 A:middle
that a user -- additionally, we
should add a button trait to it

00:19:15.006 --> 00:19:16.346 A:middle
so a user knows they
can double-tap

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:17.536 A:middle
and activate this element.

00:19:18.696 --> 00:19:21.786 A:middle
The other issue we had on this
screen was the calories label

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:25.256 A:middle
was being spoken "210 c"
instead of "210 calories."

00:19:26.046 --> 00:19:28.896 A:middle
So let's go to wherever
the number

00:19:28.896 --> 00:19:30.926 A:middle
of calories are being
said, which is right here

00:19:31.136 --> 00:19:32.076 A:middle
on the Calories label.

00:19:32.396 --> 00:19:37.086 A:middle
Setting text to be the
number of calories and c.

00:19:37.506 --> 00:19:39.826 A:middle
Let's add a line to Set
Accessibility Label here too.

00:19:48.046 --> 00:19:50.196 A:middle
What we are doing here is
taking the calories label,

00:19:50.516 --> 00:19:52.506 A:middle
calling the function set
Accessibility Label on it,

00:19:53.406 --> 00:19:56.336 A:middle
and passing in a string,
which uses the number

00:19:56.336 --> 00:19:58.486 A:middle
of calories followed
by the string Calories.

00:19:58.986 --> 00:20:02.646 A:middle
So a user will hear "210
calories" instead of "210 c."

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:58.986 --> 00:20:02.646 A:middle
So a user will hear "210
calories" instead of "210 c."

00:20:03.656 --> 00:20:06.196 A:middle
So we fixed the Make Sandwich
screen in terms of accessibility

00:20:06.196 --> 00:20:07.336 A:middle
and we want to test our changes.

00:20:07.796 --> 00:20:10.036 A:middle
We can build onto the Watch,
but that's going to take time

00:20:10.096 --> 00:20:12.446 A:middle
to build on the Watch for
every iterative change.

00:20:13.006 --> 00:20:14.476 A:middle
Instead, let's use
the Simulator.

00:20:14.926 --> 00:20:16.696 A:middle
I am going to run
this on the Simulator.

00:20:26.216 --> 00:20:29.896 A:middle
Now, to test accessibility
changes on the Simulator,

00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:33.496 A:middle
you have to use Accessibility
Inspector, and the way you turn

00:20:33.496 --> 00:20:35.656 A:middle
on the Accessibility Inspector
is by going to Settings,

00:20:36.056 --> 00:20:40.686 A:middle
General, Accessibility,
Accessibility Inspector.

00:20:40.686 --> 00:20:42.116 A:middle
This is a Simulator-only tool.

00:20:43.506 --> 00:20:45.906 A:middle
This allows you to inspect the
accessibility of your elements

00:20:46.066 --> 00:20:51.186 A:middle
by clicking on them, displaying
exactly what is contained inside

00:20:51.186 --> 00:20:55.686 A:middle
the element in this red box,
and also seeing descriptions

00:20:55.686 --> 00:20:57.996 A:middle
of that element, such
as label, hint, value,

00:20:57.996 --> 00:20:59.236 A:middle
and traits associated with it.

00:20:59.286 --> 00:21:01.286 A:middle
So this is awfully
useful when you are trying

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.286 --> 00:21:01.286 A:middle
So this is awfully
useful when you are trying

00:21:01.286 --> 00:21:02.766 A:middle
to make an element accessible.

00:21:04.006 --> 00:21:09.946 A:middle
So let's go ahead and
see if our changes took.

00:21:10.136 --> 00:21:11.896 A:middle
Now with the Accessibility
Inspector,

00:21:12.076 --> 00:21:13.336 A:middle
clicking only selects
an element.

00:21:13.446 --> 00:21:15.076 A:middle
To activate an element,
you have to double-click.

00:21:15.076 --> 00:21:20.086 A:middle
Now, let's click this.

00:21:20.826 --> 00:21:21.976 A:middle
So let's notice a
few things here.

00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:26.956 A:middle
First of all, notice how the
whole layer is one element.

00:21:27.736 --> 00:21:30.866 A:middle
So now a VoiceOver user only has
to swipe once for each layer,

00:21:31.126 --> 00:21:33.056 A:middle
so they can make their
sandwich quicker and easier.

00:21:33.616 --> 00:21:37.666 A:middle
Also, notice how the Calories
label now speaks "210 calories,

00:21:37.666 --> 00:21:38.836 A:middle
" so it's much more clear

00:21:38.836 --> 00:21:40.766 A:middle
to the user what this
is actually saying.

00:21:41.346 --> 00:21:44.176 A:middle
And finally, it has a button
trait, so our user now knows

00:21:44.176 --> 00:21:46.086 A:middle
that they can double-tap
and activate this element.

00:21:47.146 --> 00:21:48.076 A:middle
So we fixed a screen.

00:21:48.546 --> 00:21:51.616 A:middle
Let's go ahead and fix
the starting screen

00:21:51.616 --> 00:21:53.786 A:middle
where we actually -- the
interface controller.

00:21:54.936 --> 00:21:56.756 A:middle
Now, the first issue
we had here was

00:21:56.926 --> 00:21:59.256 A:middle
that sandwich image
representation was not

00:21:59.256 --> 00:22:00.136 A:middle
accessible at all.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:59.256 --> 00:22:00.136 A:middle
accessible at all.

00:22:00.676 --> 00:22:03.106 A:middle
And that sandwich image
representation actually provided

00:22:03.106 --> 00:22:04.486 A:middle
a lot of information
to the user.

00:22:05.286 --> 00:22:07.876 A:middle
So it's a bit hard
to actually try

00:22:07.876 --> 00:22:10.096 A:middle
to just add an accessibility
label to that image

00:22:10.316 --> 00:22:12.956 A:middle
because we want to express
what layers are on there

00:22:12.956 --> 00:22:14.096 A:middle
and the order of those layers.

00:22:15.146 --> 00:22:18.286 A:middle
So this seems like a job for
accessibility image regions.

00:22:19.166 --> 00:22:22.766 A:middle
So let's first find out where
the sandwich image is set.

00:22:22.976 --> 00:22:26.416 A:middle
That's set over here, and
the image is generated here.

00:22:26.606 --> 00:22:27.956 A:middle
Let's generate the
image regions.

00:22:27.956 --> 00:22:34.556 A:middle
So I am going to add a function
to generate the image regions.

00:22:35.046 --> 00:22:37.866 A:middle
What this function is doing
is enumerating each layer,

00:22:38.696 --> 00:22:42.376 A:middle
creating an accessibility
image region, setting the label

00:22:42.376 --> 00:22:44.276 A:middle
of that image region to
be the name of the layer

00:22:44.636 --> 00:22:46.796 A:middle
or the sandwich layer,
and setting the frame

00:22:46.796 --> 00:22:49.716 A:middle
to be the frame used to
generate the original image.

00:22:50.616 --> 00:22:52.886 A:middle
Finally, we are adding it to
an array and returning that.

00:22:53.906 --> 00:22:55.996 A:middle
Let's go ahead and add this to
the header so we can call it

00:22:55.996 --> 00:22:57.116 A:middle
from the interface controller.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:02.046 --> 00:23:03.806 A:middle
And then let's go
ahead and call it

00:23:03.806 --> 00:23:04.816 A:middle
from the interface controller.

00:23:11.146 --> 00:23:12.786 A:middle
So we are taking
the sandwich image,

00:23:13.426 --> 00:23:15.466 A:middle
we are calling Set Accessibility
Image Regions on it,

00:23:15.956 --> 00:23:17.366 A:middle
or the generated image regions.

00:23:17.886 --> 00:23:21.666 A:middle
Now, the second issue
we had here was

00:23:21.726 --> 00:23:24.646 A:middle
that the information button
only being spoken as "i."

00:23:25.136 --> 00:23:27.436 A:middle
Since the label doesn't change
at all throughout the lifecycle

00:23:27.436 --> 00:23:28.306 A:middle
of the information button,

00:23:28.636 --> 00:23:30.146 A:middle
we can simply set it
in the Storyboard.

00:23:30.706 --> 00:23:33.236 A:middle
Let's select that
information button.

00:23:33.766 --> 00:23:37.976 A:middle
Let's go ahead and set the
label to be "information."

00:23:38.506 --> 00:23:40.176 A:middle
Like so. Okay.

00:23:44.556 --> 00:23:46.956 A:middle
So now we fixed that label.

00:23:46.956 --> 00:23:49.236 A:middle
But the other issue we had
with the information button was

00:23:49.236 --> 00:23:51.346 A:middle
that it wasn't large
enough for a VoiceOver user

00:23:51.346 --> 00:23:52.876 A:middle
to easily feel on screen.

00:23:53.286 --> 00:23:55.896 A:middle
So we need to resize it based
on whether VoiceOver is running.

00:23:55.896 --> 00:23:57.906 A:middle
So I am going to add
a function to do that.

00:23:58.406 --> 00:24:04.086 A:middle
What this is doing is it checks
whether VoiceOver is running

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:58.406 --> 00:24:04.086 A:middle
What this is doing is it checks
whether VoiceOver is running

00:24:04.256 --> 00:24:06.586 A:middle
with a WK Accessibility
Is VoiceOver Running call,

00:24:07.416 --> 00:24:09.656 A:middle
and if it is, it sets the
height and width to be 40.

00:24:09.946 --> 00:24:11.186 A:middle
Otherwise it sets it to be 20.

00:24:11.886 --> 00:24:17.436 A:middle
Now, we have to call this on
Will Activate, so this ...

00:24:32.856 --> 00:24:35.686 A:middle
And also, just in case someone
turns VoiceOver on while

00:24:35.686 --> 00:24:37.676 A:middle
on this screen, we should
go ahead and register

00:24:37.676 --> 00:24:42.726 A:middle
for the notification and
have it call this function.

00:24:43.456 --> 00:24:46.936 A:middle
Notification is WK accessibility
VoiceOver status changed.

00:24:48.176 --> 00:24:52.806 A:middle
Now, let's see our fixed
application in action.

00:24:54.546 --> 00:24:54.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Eats.

00:24:54.876 --> 00:24:56.696 A:middle
Eats fixed.

00:24:57.526 --> 00:25:04.156 A:middle
Eats fixed.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:57.526 --> 00:25:04.156 A:middle
Eats fixed.

00:25:04.966 --> 00:25:05.916 A:middle
Make sandwich.

00:25:06.416 --> 00:25:06.916 A:middle
Button.

00:25:07.246 --> 00:25:07.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; QASID SADIQ: Right away,

00:25:07.796 --> 00:25:10.556 A:middle
we can see that that information
button is already larger.

00:25:10.556 --> 00:25:11.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Information
button.

00:25:11.916 --> 00:25:14.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; QASID SADIQ: And the label
is being spoken correctly.

00:25:14.666 --> 00:25:18.926 A:middle
So let's go ahead and
make our sandwich.

00:25:18.926 --> 00:25:20.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Make sandwich.

00:25:20.976 --> 00:25:23.386 A:middle
Button. Tap what you
want in your sandwich.

00:25:24.146 --> 00:25:26.606 A:middle
Roast beef, 210 calories.

00:25:27.166 --> 00:25:30.536 A:middle
Button. One layer of roast beef.

00:25:30.726 --> 00:25:32.806 A:middle
Bread, 130 calories.

00:25:33.026 --> 00:25:34.386 A:middle
One layer of bread.

00:25:34.716 --> 00:25:38.186 A:middle
One layer of roast
beef, 210 calories.

00:25:38.706 --> 00:25:39.136 A:middle
Button.

00:25:39.776 --> 00:25:40.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; QASID SADIQ: Okay.

00:25:40.556 --> 00:25:43.296 A:middle
So right away you can see the
calories label is being spoken

00:25:43.296 --> 00:25:45.436 A:middle
correctly, and that's a
lot more clear to the user.

00:25:46.036 --> 00:25:48.206 A:middle
Also, each layer is
a separate element,

00:25:48.276 --> 00:25:49.976 A:middle
making navigation
significantly better.

00:25:51.336 --> 00:25:53.236 A:middle
Now let's go ahead and look
at our image representation

00:25:53.236 --> 00:25:55.206 A:middle
of our sandwich and see
how accessible that is.

00:25:55.206 --> 00:25:57.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Make sandwich.

00:25:57.326 --> 00:25:57.946 A:middle
Roast beef.

00:25:58.586 --> 00:26:00.606 A:middle
Image. Bread.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:58.586 --> 00:26:00.606 A:middle
Image. Bread.

00:26:01.116 --> 00:26:01.546 A:middle
Image.

00:26:02.296 --> 00:26:02.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; QASID SADIQ: Now,

00:26:02.766 --> 00:26:05.636 A:middle
our VoiceOver user can literally
swipe through their sandwich.

00:26:06.206 --> 00:26:11.746 A:middle
So there you go.

00:26:13.316 --> 00:26:18.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Home.

00:26:21.956 --> 00:26:22.136 A:middle
(Applause)

00:26:22.266 --> 00:26:26.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; QASID SADIQ: Now, as you
guys know, you, as developers,

00:26:26.056 --> 00:26:28.926 A:middle
now have the ability to
make your own custom clock

00:26:28.926 --> 00:26:29.916 A:middle
face Complications.

00:26:30.616 --> 00:26:34.756 A:middle
And just like your applications,
these need to be accessible too.

00:26:34.966 --> 00:26:38.206 A:middle
Now, our frameworks can
determine an accessibility label

00:26:38.206 --> 00:26:40.986 A:middle
for most complications, but
there are a couple situations

00:26:40.986 --> 00:26:43.756 A:middle
where that accessibility
label may be misrepresentative

00:26:43.756 --> 00:26:45.516 A:middle
or nonexistent.

00:26:46.376 --> 00:26:49.176 A:middle
You see, each clock face
Complication is composed

00:26:49.176 --> 00:26:53.086 A:middle
of a set of image and text
providers, and although most

00:26:53.086 --> 00:26:56.516 A:middle
of these providers have very
obvious accessibility labels

00:26:56.516 --> 00:27:00.976 A:middle
associated with them,
a couple don't.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:56.516 --> 00:27:00.976 A:middle
associated with them,
a couple don't.

00:27:00.976 --> 00:27:02.836 A:middle
Image provider and
Simple Text provider.

00:27:03.506 --> 00:27:05.686 A:middle
So for these two
particular providers,

00:27:05.686 --> 00:27:09.086 A:middle
we've added a property,
Accessibility Label.

00:27:10.396 --> 00:27:13.146 A:middle
This works just like the
accessibility label does

00:27:13.146 --> 00:27:14.756 A:middle
on a normal WatchKit
application,

00:27:15.406 --> 00:27:16.466 A:middle
and it's actually pretty easy.

00:27:17.186 --> 00:27:25.856 A:middle
So I made a complication to
make it really easy for you

00:27:25.856 --> 00:27:27.656 A:middle
to order a sandwich, just in
case you are really hungry

00:27:27.656 --> 00:27:29.516 A:middle
that you don't have time
to open the application.

00:27:29.516 --> 00:27:31.276 A:middle
You simply want to
lift your wrist

00:27:31.476 --> 00:27:32.816 A:middle
and get a sandwich right now.

00:27:32.966 --> 00:27:35.296 A:middle
So this is the Complication
right here.

00:27:35.706 --> 00:27:36.516 A:middle
And since it's an image,

00:27:36.516 --> 00:27:39.306 A:middle
it has no accessibility
label associated with it.

00:27:39.666 --> 00:27:42.586 A:middle
So let's go ahead and actually
set an accessibility label

00:27:42.706 --> 00:27:43.306 A:middle
on it.

00:27:47.116 --> 00:27:53.306 A:middle
So we go to wherever the
Complication is created,

00:27:54.516 --> 00:27:55.646 A:middle
or the provider is created.

00:27:56.146 --> 00:27:58.436 A:middle
And we set an accessibility
label.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:05.416 --> 00:28:06.196 A:middle
And there you go.

00:28:07.406 --> 00:28:07.986 A:middle
It's that easy.

00:28:08.966 --> 00:28:11.886 A:middle
So let's see how a
VoiceOver user will hear this.

00:28:23.876 --> 00:28:25.696 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Get sandwich now.

00:28:25.946 --> 00:28:27.246 A:middle
&gt;&gt; QASID SADIQ: So
if you couldn't hear,

00:28:27.566 --> 00:28:29.396 A:middle
the label spoke "get
a sandwich now,"

00:28:29.806 --> 00:28:31.526 A:middle
so now our VoiceOver
users have the ability

00:28:31.906 --> 00:28:35.786 A:middle
to order a sandwich
on a double-tap.

00:28:35.986 --> 00:28:38.756 A:middle
So as you can see, it's
actually really quite easy

00:28:38.756 --> 00:28:41.006 A:middle
to make your applications
and Complications accessible.

00:28:41.006 --> 00:28:43.676 A:middle
Let's talk about a few things
you should keep in mind

00:28:43.676 --> 00:28:45.806 A:middle
when you are designing your
accessibility experience.

00:28:45.856 --> 00:28:49.236 A:middle
First of all, try to make
your images accessible.

00:28:49.856 --> 00:28:51.896 A:middle
Especially if they provide
valuable information

00:28:51.896 --> 00:28:52.496 A:middle
to the user.

00:28:52.496 --> 00:28:54.546 A:middle
You should set an
accessibility label on them.

00:28:55.036 --> 00:28:57.656 A:middle
Or, if they are providing a
very complex set of information,

00:28:57.906 --> 00:28:59.826 A:middle
use the accessibility
image regions API.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:03.336 --> 00:29:04.726 A:middle
When you design your
application,

00:29:04.726 --> 00:29:06.236 A:middle
think about how a
VoiceOver user is going

00:29:06.236 --> 00:29:07.476 A:middle
to navigate your screen.

00:29:07.536 --> 00:29:09.696 A:middle
You don't want to make it
so a VoiceOver user has

00:29:09.696 --> 00:29:12.386 A:middle
to swipe several times to
get past one logical item.

00:29:12.826 --> 00:29:15.646 A:middle
So group your accessibility
elements together by using Set

00:29:15.646 --> 00:29:16.766 A:middle
As Accessibility Element.

00:29:17.396 --> 00:29:21.396 A:middle
Now, this is probably true for
non-VoiceOver users as well,

00:29:21.396 --> 00:29:23.336 A:middle
but you should avoid
tiny interface items.

00:29:23.926 --> 00:29:27.066 A:middle
It's difficult for a
VoiceOver user to feel

00:29:27.096 --> 00:29:29.556 A:middle
and find a tiny interface
item on screen.

00:29:31.316 --> 00:29:33.286 A:middle
Finally, most importantly,

00:29:33.866 --> 00:29:35.676 A:middle
try accessibility
on your application.

00:29:36.176 --> 00:29:38.506 A:middle
See what your application looks
like with increased text size.

00:29:38.956 --> 00:29:41.996 A:middle
Or, see how your application
works with VoiceOver on.

00:29:42.496 --> 00:29:43.926 A:middle
You might be surprised
at what you find.

00:29:44.536 --> 00:29:50.936 A:middle
In conclusion, the Apple Watch
is quite an accessible device.

00:29:51.466 --> 00:29:54.396 A:middle
But for it to be
completely accessible,

00:29:54.396 --> 00:29:56.256 A:middle
it needs to have
accessible apps.

00:29:57.036 --> 00:29:59.426 A:middle
This is where you guys really
get to be the champions

00:29:59.426 --> 00:30:00.706 A:middle
of our VoiceOver users.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.426 --> 00:30:00.706 A:middle
of our VoiceOver users.

00:30:02.376 --> 00:30:05.136 A:middle
And as you guys just saw, this
is actually a pretty easy task.

00:30:07.206 --> 00:30:11.156 A:middle
So let's empower all of our
users to do those amazing things

00:30:11.156 --> 00:30:15.176 A:middle
that our applications let us
do, regardless of who they are

00:30:15.176 --> 00:30:17.236 A:middle
or how they are interact
with the world.

00:30:19.236 --> 00:30:20.256 A:middle
Thank you for your time.

00:30:21.296 --> 00:30:22.706 A:middle
You can actually
get more information

00:30:22.706 --> 00:30:24.476 A:middle
on the WatchKit Programming
Guide.

00:30:24.946 --> 00:30:27.256 A:middle
You can ask questions
on the Developer forums,

00:30:27.256 --> 00:30:29.126 A:middle
or contact your Evangelist,
Paul Marcos.

00:30:29.596 --> 00:30:30.506 A:middle
Thank you for your time.

00:30:30.596 --> 00:30:32.926 A:middle
I appreciate it.

00:30:33.696 --> 00:30:33.906 A:middle
(Applause)
