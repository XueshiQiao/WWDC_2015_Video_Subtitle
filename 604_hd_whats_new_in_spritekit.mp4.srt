[Applause]

00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:32.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TIM ORIOL: Hi and welcome
to What's New in SpriteKit.

00:00:32.906 --> 00:00:35.606 A:middle
We have a lot of great new
features and enhancements

00:00:35.606 --> 00:00:36.416 A:middle
to tell you about today.

00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:39.776 A:middle
I know that there's a few people
in the audience that are new

00:00:39.776 --> 00:00:43.136 A:middle
to SpriteKit and I just wanted
to take a few minutes first

00:00:43.546 --> 00:00:45.666 A:middle
to recap what we're all about.

00:00:48.846 --> 00:00:52.996 A:middle
So SpriteKit is Apple's 2D frame
work for games and graphics.

00:00:53.426 --> 00:00:56.306 A:middle
And we provide you tools
like integrated physics,

00:00:56.936 --> 00:00:58.896 A:middle
particle simulations, actions

00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:00.726 A:middle
and animations and,
of course, Sprite.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:00.726 A:middle
and animations and,
of course, Sprite.

00:01:01.706 --> 00:01:06.206 A:middle
We set out to design
SpriteKit to be both powerful

00:01:06.206 --> 00:01:08.926 A:middle
but also really,
really easy to use.

00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:11.896 A:middle
We wanted someone who's maybe
even has never written a game

00:01:11.896 --> 00:01:15.966 A:middle
before to be able to come to
our platform, pick up SpriteKit

00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:17.766 A:middle
and be up and running
in no time.

00:01:18.676 --> 00:01:22.176 A:middle
We really wanted to deliver
something that lets you focus

00:01:22.176 --> 00:01:25.306 A:middle
on what you do best and
that is making great games.

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:33.246 A:middle
We designed SpriteKit to work
across iPhone iPad and Mac

00:01:33.246 --> 00:01:35.936 A:middle
and in addition to this media
you can deliver your app

00:01:35.936 --> 00:01:39.726 A:middle
to multiple platforms, it also
means that you can prototype

00:01:39.726 --> 00:01:41.906 A:middle
and test all of your
SpriteKit games directly

00:01:41.906 --> 00:01:47.416 A:middle
on the Mac before you
even put it on a device.

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:50.626 A:middle
and with SpriteKit the framework
is really only half the story.

00:01:51.206 --> 00:01:54.626 A:middle
Since the beginning we spent
a lot of effort on our tools

00:01:54.796 --> 00:01:57.506 A:middle
and we have continued to
invest in that year after year

00:01:57.506 --> 00:02:02.036 A:middle
to allow you to edit your
particle affects as well

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:57.506 --> 00:02:02.036 A:middle
to allow you to edit your
particle affects as well

00:02:02.036 --> 00:02:06.396 A:middle
as entire scenes and new this
year actions and animations

00:02:06.396 --> 00:02:08.175 A:middle
as well, directly inside

00:02:08.175 --> 00:02:11.606 A:middle
of Xcode before you even
write a line of code.

00:02:13.516 --> 00:02:15.896 A:middle
So now lets talk about the new
additions to the framework.

00:02:16.716 --> 00:02:19.576 A:middle
The first one was requested
by developers quite a bit

00:02:20.226 --> 00:02:25.336 A:middle
and this has to do with the
Viewport and the Viewport is

00:02:25.336 --> 00:02:28.046 A:middle
when we're talking about which
portion of your scene is visible

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:31.356 A:middle
in a SpriteKit view at any time.

00:02:31.356 --> 00:02:34.336 A:middle
The way this works now is if
you want to move your camera,

00:02:34.826 --> 00:02:38.426 A:middle
you would have to realign
every piece of geometry

00:02:38.426 --> 00:02:41.056 A:middle
within your game, or if you
wanted to follow along one

00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:42.826 A:middle
of your hero characters
through your game world,

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:44.756 A:middle
you need to do those
calculations.

00:02:45.386 --> 00:02:48.376 A:middle
Now this works, but it is
not as intuitive as we'd like

00:02:49.316 --> 00:02:51.596 A:middle
and if you're also
running physics simulations

00:02:51.656 --> 00:02:54.806 A:middle
on those game entities while
you're changing their actual

00:02:54.806 --> 00:02:57.526 A:middle
position, you can get
artifacts from that.

00:02:58.716 --> 00:03:00.906 A:middle
We thought we could do
something a little bit better.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:58.716 --> 00:03:00.906 A:middle
We thought we could do
something a little bit better.

00:03:01.986 --> 00:03:04.086 A:middle
We would like to
introduce SKCameraNode.

00:03:04.556 --> 00:03:10.576 A:middle
With the CameraNode we allow you
to simply specify which portion

00:03:10.576 --> 00:03:13.456 A:middle
of your view is going to be
visible and the camera does this

00:03:13.456 --> 00:03:14.626 A:middle
by representing the center

00:03:14.626 --> 00:03:16.016 A:middle
of the visible content
in your scene.

00:03:16.626 --> 00:03:19.816 A:middle
So now you can move the
CameraNode through your scene

00:03:20.246 --> 00:03:22.036 A:middle
with the same logic
that you move all

00:03:22.036 --> 00:03:23.736 A:middle
of your other game
entities through your scene.

00:03:24.716 --> 00:03:26.896 A:middle
We have a property on
SKScene that will allow you

00:03:26.896 --> 00:03:29.746 A:middle
to select the camera you'd
like to use so these scenes,

00:03:29.746 --> 00:03:31.806 A:middle
you can have multiple
cameras throughout your scene

00:03:32.126 --> 00:03:34.576 A:middle
and you can select the
active one via property.

00:03:35.976 --> 00:03:38.696 A:middle
If you leave the property
as its default value of nil,

00:03:39.156 --> 00:03:41.666 A:middle
we get the same experiences
you have today

00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:44.146 A:middle
and all the SpriteKit
rendering is as it was.

00:03:44.656 --> 00:03:47.716 A:middle
But the best feature of all

00:03:47.716 --> 00:03:50.906 A:middle
about SKCameraNode
is that it's a node.

00:03:51.626 --> 00:03:54.366 A:middle
And this means that you get
access to all the great features

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:55.426 A:middle
in SpriteKit for nodes.

00:03:55.706 --> 00:03:57.846 A:middle
You have access to
our actions library

00:03:57.846 --> 00:03:59.706 A:middle
so you can now run
actions on the camera.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:00.176 --> 00:04:02.076 A:middle
You have access to
our constraint system

00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:03.886 A:middle
so you can apply
constraints to the camera.

00:04:04.246 --> 00:04:06.356 A:middle
You can make it align
with game entities,

00:04:06.356 --> 00:04:08.766 A:middle
you can make it always stay
within a certain distance

00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:10.026 A:middle
of objects within your game.

00:04:10.616 --> 00:04:13.646 A:middle
Beyond just moving the camera
you now have access to rotation

00:04:13.646 --> 00:04:16.065 A:middle
and scale via those
properties on the node.

00:04:17.305 --> 00:04:21.726 A:middle
So for example, in a game like
this, I may start the camera off

00:04:21.726 --> 00:04:24.726 A:middle
to the side, and I might
apply a few move animations

00:04:24.766 --> 00:04:27.256 A:middle
to reveal the bad guys in
my scene before centering

00:04:27.256 --> 00:04:28.236 A:middle
on the hero character.

00:04:28.926 --> 00:04:31.166 A:middle
And then I can apply a
scale action if I want

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:33.446 A:middle
to zoom the camera in or out.

00:04:33.446 --> 00:04:36.016 A:middle
I can even use our follow
path action if I want

00:04:36.016 --> 00:04:37.816 A:middle
to have the camera follow
a Bezier [Unintelligable]

00:04:37.816 --> 00:04:41.516 A:middle
and if I really want to make my
user sick I can spin the camera

00:04:41.516 --> 00:04:42.946 A:middle
around and throw it
around the scene.

00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:46.676 A:middle
So you really have full
control over what part

00:04:46.676 --> 00:04:48.836 A:middle
of your game is visible
now in SpriteKit

00:04:49.126 --> 00:04:49.806 A:middle
and I think this is going

00:04:49.806 --> 00:04:51.966 A:middle
to be a great addition
to your toolkit.

00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:57.216 A:middle
[Applause]

00:04:57.716 --> 00:04:59.346 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TIM ORIOL: In
addition to camera,

00:04:59.346 --> 00:05:00.856 A:middle
we've also done work with audio.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.346 --> 00:05:00.856 A:middle
we've also done work with audio.

00:05:01.486 --> 00:05:05.876 A:middle
We're adding an SKAudioNode to
allow you to add positional,

00:05:06.026 --> 00:05:07.976 A:middle
environmental sound right
in your SpriteKit game.

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:12.606 A:middle
[Applause]

00:05:13.106 --> 00:05:16.336 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TIM ORIOL: We're leveraging
Apple's powerful AV audio engine

00:05:16.386 --> 00:05:18.116 A:middle
framework that we
introduced last year.

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:19.886 A:middle
If you're not familiar
with this,

00:05:19.936 --> 00:05:22.336 A:middle
it lets you specify
your tone soundscape

00:05:22.736 --> 00:05:24.886 A:middle
and play sound emitters
within that environment

00:05:25.266 --> 00:05:27.896 A:middle
and it will play them
back in correspondence

00:05:27.896 --> 00:05:29.566 A:middle
to a listener position
that you specify.

00:05:30.686 --> 00:05:33.596 A:middle
In SpriteKit we're going to
do all the wiring up for you.

00:05:34.356 --> 00:05:37.636 A:middle
All you have to do is specify
the sound asset that you want

00:05:37.636 --> 00:05:40.716 A:middle
to play back via
file name or URL

00:05:41.146 --> 00:05:44.526 A:middle
and we'll use the AudioNodes
position in your scene,

00:05:44.526 --> 00:05:46.826 A:middle
along with the listener
point that you specify,

00:05:46.826 --> 00:05:50.626 A:middle
to wire up the whole audiograph
and give you really easy access

00:05:50.896 --> 00:05:53.096 A:middle
to immersive, positional
audio in your game.

00:05:53.966 --> 00:05:56.556 A:middle
If you want to dig a little
deeper and get your hands-on,

00:05:56.976 --> 00:06:00.106 A:middle
you can access the
underlying AVAudioNode as well

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:56.976 --> 00:06:00.106 A:middle
you can access the
underlying AVAudioNode as well

00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:02.856 A:middle
from a property on the
node and go to town

00:06:02.856 --> 00:06:05.766 A:middle
and set any settings
you want on there.

00:06:05.966 --> 00:06:09.566 A:middle
To demonstrate the types of
affects you'd be able to add

00:06:09.686 --> 00:06:12.646 A:middle
to your SpriteKit game
using this new technology,

00:06:12.836 --> 00:06:14.436 A:middle
I'm going to have an
example scene here

00:06:14.766 --> 00:06:15.926 A:middle
where I've got my goblin.

00:06:15.926 --> 00:06:17.926 A:middle
I'm going to make
him my listener,

00:06:18.186 --> 00:06:20.036 A:middle
so I set my listener
position there.

00:06:21.076 --> 00:06:23.056 A:middle
I have added a fireball
to my scene.

00:06:23.276 --> 00:06:24.756 A:middle
This is going to
be my sound source,

00:06:24.756 --> 00:06:26.556 A:middle
so I've added it
as an SKAudioNode.

00:06:27.276 --> 00:06:31.416 A:middle
When I play this back
listen how the audio affects

00:06:31.416 --> 00:06:33.416 A:middle
as the fireball moves
around the scene.

00:06:33.416 --> 00:06:37.476 A:middle
You should notice it become
richer, more centered and louder

00:06:37.476 --> 00:06:41.196 A:middle
as it gets close to our listener
and more one-sided and distant

00:06:41.666 --> 00:06:42.816 A:middle
as it gets to the
side of the scene.

00:06:42.816 --> 00:06:43.976 A:middle
Let's take a listen.

00:06:44.516 --> 00:06:59.306 A:middle
[Sound effect]

00:06:59.806 --> 00:07:00.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TIM ORIOL: So that's
pretty cool, right?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.806 --> 00:07:00.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TIM ORIOL: So that's
pretty cool, right?

00:07:01.516 --> 00:07:05.236 A:middle
[Applause]

00:07:05.736 --> 00:07:07.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TIM ORIOL: Beyond the
additional set up I have

00:07:07.406 --> 00:07:09.696 A:middle
to do nothing to update
these effects as they move

00:07:09.696 --> 00:07:11.686 A:middle
around the game world,
they're completely tied

00:07:12.066 --> 00:07:14.016 A:middle
to the game logic that's
driving my game already.

00:07:16.136 --> 00:07:20.766 A:middle
Also this year we focused on
referencing and instancing.

00:07:21.196 --> 00:07:25.496 A:middle
We know you spend a lot of time
designing high-quality content

00:07:25.756 --> 00:07:30.056 A:middle
and animations for your games
and we want you to let you reuse

00:07:30.056 --> 00:07:33.376 A:middle
that content anywhere
where you would like to.

00:07:33.376 --> 00:07:36.836 A:middle
We're allowing you to
create serialized data files

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:42.296 A:middle
for your nodes and your
actions and then add them

00:07:42.366 --> 00:07:45.066 A:middle
as a reference instead of just
loading them into your scene.

00:07:45.066 --> 00:07:48.336 A:middle
This way, every time you make
a change to the source asset

00:07:48.656 --> 00:07:52.536 A:middle
that is automatically reflected
in the content of your game.

00:07:54.196 --> 00:07:55.916 A:middle
How do I do this for nodes?

00:07:56.736 --> 00:07:59.756 A:middle
For nodes I design
part of my scene,

00:07:59.756 --> 00:08:02.816 A:middle
maybe a background element,
or some scenery in our editor

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:59.756 --> 00:08:02.816 A:middle
maybe a background element,
or some scenery in our editor

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:07.356 A:middle
with an Xcode and then I can
just drag-and-drop those files

00:08:07.736 --> 00:08:08.936 A:middle
into my main scene in Xcode

00:08:08.936 --> 00:08:10.616 A:middle
and it will automatically
create a reference

00:08:10.896 --> 00:08:12.036 A:middle
and it is all set up for you.

00:08:13.086 --> 00:08:15.216 A:middle
If you want to do this
in code you can as well,

00:08:15.676 --> 00:08:18.696 A:middle
you can manually construct
an SKReferenceNode,

00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:23.106 A:middle
assign it a file name
or even a URL and when

00:08:23.106 --> 00:08:26.046 A:middle
that content is first presented
in your game we'll load

00:08:26.046 --> 00:08:28.526 A:middle
in that content based
on the latest version

00:08:28.806 --> 00:08:29.986 A:middle
of the file that's
in your bundle.

00:08:30.616 --> 00:08:34.025 A:middle
We can also do the
same thing for actions.

00:08:34.525 --> 00:08:37.395 A:middle
With actions go check out
our great new action editor

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:40.726 A:middle
and beyond creating and
composing the actions

00:08:40.726 --> 00:08:43.066 A:middle
in Xcode you can
give all them names.

00:08:43.746 --> 00:08:46.076 A:middle
These names are the key to
using them in your game.

00:08:46.716 --> 00:08:50.446 A:middle
We have added a selector to
SKAction called actionNamed.

00:08:51.016 --> 00:08:54.556 A:middle
This works just like it does
for SKTexture and textureNamed.

00:08:55.056 --> 00:08:56.766 A:middle
You pass in the name
of the action you want.

00:08:57.416 --> 00:09:00.996 A:middle
We're going to automatically
look inside of your app bundle

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:57.416 --> 00:09:00.996 A:middle
We're going to automatically
look inside of your app bundle

00:09:01.706 --> 00:09:04.336 A:middle
in all of the serialized
action files, find the one

00:09:04.336 --> 00:09:06.526 A:middle
with the appropriate
name and then surface

00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:07.546 A:middle
that to the application.

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:11.276 A:middle
Please use this multiple
times within your game.

00:09:11.276 --> 00:09:14.966 A:middle
We have done all the work on
our side to take care of caching

00:09:15.356 --> 00:09:17.776 A:middle
and we guarantee that the same
action will never be loaded

00:09:17.776 --> 00:09:21.436 A:middle
from disk more than
once in your game.

00:09:21.666 --> 00:09:24.686 A:middle
Sometimes you have an action
that you would want to use more

00:09:24.686 --> 00:09:26.866 A:middle
than once but it will play
back faster or slower.

00:09:27.456 --> 00:09:29.616 A:middle
We have added an additional
selector that will allow you

00:09:29.616 --> 00:09:31.326 A:middle
to override the duration
of the action.

00:09:32.106 --> 00:09:34.006 A:middle
This is a smart scaling
of the time,

00:09:34.096 --> 00:09:37.336 A:middle
so even if you have a nested
action with nested groups

00:09:37.336 --> 00:09:39.806 A:middle
and sequences, it will
dynamically scale it

00:09:39.806 --> 00:09:43.576 A:middle
to the new duration so that each
component is the same fractional

00:09:43.606 --> 00:09:45.286 A:middle
size to the original duration.

00:09:46.646 --> 00:09:50.226 A:middle
Those are our utilities
for reusable components

00:09:50.596 --> 00:09:53.626 A:middle
that you can use in the
same scene in the same game

00:09:53.626 --> 00:09:54.826 A:middle
or across multiple games.

00:09:55.296 --> 00:09:59.046 A:middle
We have also added a couple
new actions to the framework.

00:09:59.046 --> 00:10:01.746 A:middle
So now that we have these
positional AudioNodes it would

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.046 --> 00:10:01.746 A:middle
So now that we have these
positional AudioNodes it would

00:10:01.746 --> 00:10:04.286 A:middle
be nice to be able to control
the playback via actions.

00:10:04.476 --> 00:10:10.026 A:middle
We have added play, pause, play
back rate as well as actions

00:10:10.096 --> 00:10:12.066 A:middle
for volume and stereo panning.

00:10:12.636 --> 00:10:17.786 A:middle
We also are doing a little bit
more with frame animations.

00:10:18.246 --> 00:10:21.486 A:middle
We have always had
frame-based animations

00:10:21.486 --> 00:10:24.526 A:middle
in SpriteKit via the
animate with textures action

00:10:25.546 --> 00:10:28.126 A:middle
but last year we introduced
lighting to SpriteKit.

00:10:28.126 --> 00:10:31.766 A:middle
With lighting you're able to
either automatically generate

00:10:32.226 --> 00:10:34.966 A:middle
or supply your own normal
textures for sprites

00:10:34.966 --> 00:10:37.926 A:middle
within your scene and then
we can light them dynamically

00:10:37.926 --> 00:10:40.196 A:middle
at run time by moving the
light nodes around your scene.

00:10:41.596 --> 00:10:43.936 A:middle
This works great for
elements that don't change,

00:10:43.936 --> 00:10:46.906 A:middle
but if I have a frame-based
animation like this guy here,

00:10:47.666 --> 00:10:49.876 A:middle
we want those highlights
and shadows to line

00:10:49.876 --> 00:10:50.806 A:middle
up with the current position.

00:10:50.806 --> 00:10:53.366 A:middle
We don't want a specular
highlight where the leg used

00:10:53.366 --> 00:10:56.126 A:middle
to be, so we're adding
an animate

00:10:56.126 --> 00:10:58.256 A:middle
with normal textures
action as well

00:10:58.506 --> 00:11:01.236 A:middle
so you can use this
alongside the normal animation

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:58.506 --> 00:11:01.236 A:middle
so you can use this
alongside the normal animation

00:11:01.726 --> 00:11:04.606 A:middle
and get both of them in
sync for every frame.

00:11:04.686 --> 00:11:08.836 A:middle
If I run that on our character
and add lighting to the scene,

00:11:09.126 --> 00:11:11.966 A:middle
you can see that all the
highlights, shadows are kept

00:11:11.966 --> 00:11:15.586 A:middle
in sync with every frame, no
matter how my character runs.

00:11:16.516 --> 00:11:24.406 A:middle
[Applause]

00:11:24.906 --> 00:11:27.456 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TIM ORIOL: So those are
additional features we added

00:11:27.456 --> 00:11:29.476 A:middle
to the framework, we've
also done a lot of work

00:11:29.816 --> 00:11:33.046 A:middle
to integrate well with the rest
of the system and take advantage

00:11:33.046 --> 00:11:35.256 A:middle
of new hardware and frameworks

00:11:35.306 --> 00:11:36.806 A:middle
that have been added
to our platform.

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:40.126 A:middle
First I want to talk
about Metal.

00:11:40.756 --> 00:11:43.516 A:middle
We're making SpriteKit and
we're moving it directly on top

00:11:43.516 --> 00:11:48.026 A:middle
of Metal on iOS and Mac
and it will be Metal backed

00:11:48.836 --> 00:11:51.366 A:middle
on any device that
supports it and any device

00:11:51.366 --> 00:11:53.636 A:middle
that doesn't will automatically
fall back to OpenGL.

00:11:54.816 --> 00:11:58.286 A:middle
This means that you get
lower CPU utilization,

00:11:58.576 --> 00:12:00.526 A:middle
it means you get better
draw call performance

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.576 --> 00:12:00.526 A:middle
it means you get better
draw call performance

00:12:00.526 --> 00:12:03.416 A:middle
and better battery life
with zero action required

00:12:03.416 --> 00:12:04.646 A:middle
to you as a developer.

00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:10.016 A:middle
[Applause]

00:12:10.516 --> 00:12:11.036 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TIM ORIOL: We're going

00:12:11.036 --> 00:12:13.796 A:middle
to upgrade all SpriteKit apps
automatically, you don't have

00:12:13.796 --> 00:12:15.256 A:middle
to recompile or resubmit.

00:12:15.686 --> 00:12:18.746 A:middle
If it supports Metal
we're going to run it.

00:12:18.746 --> 00:12:19.756 A:middle
For those of you
that are wondering

00:12:19.756 --> 00:12:22.456 A:middle
about your custom shaders, we've
taken care of that as well.

00:12:23.006 --> 00:12:25.636 A:middle
If you have a custom shader
in your game, we're supporting

00:12:25.636 --> 00:12:28.316 A:middle
to upgrade almost all of
those to a Metal variant

00:12:28.516 --> 00:12:30.976 A:middle
and that will run just fine
on Metal devices as well.

00:12:31.516 --> 00:12:35.966 A:middle
[Applause]

00:12:36.466 --> 00:12:37.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TIM ORIOL: Next up is Swift.

00:12:38.176 --> 00:12:39.976 A:middle
We have gone through
the entire API

00:12:40.136 --> 00:12:42.366 A:middle
and we've applied
nullability qualifiers

00:12:42.666 --> 00:12:45.866 A:middle
and we've adopted Objective-C
generics on any array types

00:12:45.936 --> 00:12:47.716 A:middle
that are used for
paramaters or return types

00:12:48.366 --> 00:12:50.576 A:middle
and this will allow you
to access the full power

00:12:50.576 --> 00:12:53.376 A:middle
of SpriteKit from Swift
without any hassle.

00:12:54.396 --> 00:12:56.226 A:middle
This will also give you
enhanced type safety

00:12:56.226 --> 00:12:58.326 A:middle
within your application
whether you're using Swift

00:12:59.166 --> 00:12:59.926 A:middle
or Objective C.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:00.506 --> 00:13:04.086 A:middle
Now I would like to talk
a bit about SceneKit.

00:13:04.086 --> 00:13:06.906 A:middle
With SceneKit in case you
don't know, we allow you

00:13:06.906 --> 00:13:09.106 A:middle
to render SpriteKit
content in SceneKit

00:13:09.106 --> 00:13:10.666 A:middle
and SceneKit content
in SpriteKit.

00:13:11.326 --> 00:13:13.966 A:middle
This year we're allowing you
to go a little bit further

00:13:13.966 --> 00:13:16.536 A:middle
and use all the SpriteKit
transitions that you know

00:13:16.536 --> 00:13:19.936 A:middle
and love directly in
your SceneKits games

00:13:19.936 --> 00:13:22.756 A:middle
and you don't even have to
be using SpriteKit to do it.

00:13:22.756 --> 00:13:26.726 A:middle
You can use transitions like
the doorway one here, clip,

00:13:27.026 --> 00:13:29.706 A:middle
or even the core image
based transition effects

00:13:30.166 --> 00:13:33.166 A:middle
for your SceneKit game
and that all works fine.

00:13:34.296 --> 00:13:35.816 A:middle
SceneKit has also done work

00:13:35.876 --> 00:13:38.196 A:middle
to support Metal backed
context for this release.

00:13:38.886 --> 00:13:41.456 A:middle
We take care of automatically
matching that.

00:13:41.456 --> 00:13:43.616 A:middle
If you have a SceneKit game
that's running Metal backed

00:13:44.246 --> 00:13:45.496 A:middle
and you have SpriteKit content

00:13:45.496 --> 00:13:46.956 A:middle
in there we'll render
using Metal.

00:13:47.176 --> 00:13:49.096 A:middle
If you have a SceneKit
game that's GL backed

00:13:49.526 --> 00:13:51.806 A:middle
and you have SpriteKit in there,
we'll render using OpenGL.

00:13:52.256 --> 00:13:54.756 A:middle
You never have additional
overhead for us

00:13:54.786 --> 00:14:00.356 A:middle
to translate between
the two APIs.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:54.786 --> 00:14:00.356 A:middle
to translate between
the two APIs.

00:14:00.356 --> 00:14:03.396 A:middle
This year we've also
announced a brand-new framework

00:14:03.606 --> 00:14:04.646 A:middle
called GameplayKit.

00:14:05.116 --> 00:14:09.736 A:middle
This is really cool, it provides
you the building blocks you need

00:14:09.976 --> 00:14:14.326 A:middle
to build your game Logic like
Entity/Component systems as well

00:14:14.536 --> 00:14:18.266 A:middle
as state machines and also
provides great utilities

00:14:18.396 --> 00:14:21.516 A:middle
like AI opponents and
deterministic random sources.

00:14:22.456 --> 00:14:24.566 A:middle
One of my favorite ones
here, is its ability

00:14:24.566 --> 00:14:26.806 A:middle
to provide a pathfinding
solution for your game.

00:14:26.976 --> 00:14:28.506 A:middle
I think a lot of SpriteKit
developers are going

00:14:28.506 --> 00:14:29.186 A:middle
to be interested in this.

00:14:30.466 --> 00:14:31.916 A:middle
The way Pathfinding works

00:14:31.916 --> 00:14:34.726 A:middle
in GameplayKit is you would
specify a navigation graph

00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:37.646 A:middle
of the traversable areas
within your game world.

00:14:38.196 --> 00:14:41.436 A:middle
Then you would make
connections between those nodes

00:14:41.786 --> 00:14:43.356 A:middle
and give them an
associated cost.

00:14:44.626 --> 00:14:46.016 A:middle
Once you have this graph,

00:14:46.576 --> 00:14:48.696 A:middle
GameplayKit will then
calculate the optimal path

00:14:48.816 --> 00:14:50.086 A:middle
between any two points
in the graph.

00:14:50.986 --> 00:14:52.756 A:middle
How would I set one of
these up for a game?

00:14:53.986 --> 00:14:56.336 A:middle
If I have this SpriteKit game
here, and I've got my hero

00:14:56.336 --> 00:14:58.156 A:middle
in the lower corner, I have --

00:14:58.616 --> 00:15:01.676 A:middle
maybe I want him to move
to a certain destination.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:58.616 --> 00:15:01.676 A:middle
maybe I want him to move
to a certain destination.

00:15:02.216 --> 00:15:05.856 A:middle
I'll then specify a couple
of obstacles in my scene

00:15:05.856 --> 00:15:07.426 A:middle
that are non-traversable
regions.

00:15:07.856 --> 00:15:12.076 A:middle
Giving just this to
GameplayKit and a buffer radius

00:15:12.106 --> 00:15:14.716 A:middle
around my character that
I want it to pass through,

00:15:15.056 --> 00:15:17.746 A:middle
GameplayKit will take that
buffer radius into account,

00:15:17.746 --> 00:15:20.496 A:middle
automatically expand all of
the obstacles so we never get

00:15:20.496 --> 00:15:22.556 A:middle
within that radius of
any of the obstacles

00:15:23.246 --> 00:15:25.436 A:middle
and then create the
valid connections

00:15:25.436 --> 00:15:27.686 A:middle
and only the valid
connections within that graph,

00:15:27.856 --> 00:15:29.876 A:middle
so you're never traversing
through the obstacles.

00:15:30.436 --> 00:15:33.566 A:middle
You can then use this to perform
any pathfinding operations

00:15:33.956 --> 00:15:35.046 A:middle
within your game.

00:15:35.596 --> 00:15:37.286 A:middle
It is not specific to SpriteKit,

00:15:37.356 --> 00:15:40.636 A:middle
so you can use GameplayKits
features with SceneKit,

00:15:40.636 --> 00:15:45.506 A:middle
SpriteKit, OpenGL, Metal, any
kind of game scenario you want.

00:15:45.506 --> 00:15:47.426 A:middle
If you are doing it with
SpriteKit we made it easier.

00:15:47.426 --> 00:15:49.316 A:middle
You don't even need to
create the obstacles.

00:15:50.036 --> 00:15:53.696 A:middle
You can create the obstacles
directly from a sprite's bounds,

00:15:54.296 --> 00:15:57.746 A:middle
you can create the
obstacles from a physics body

00:15:57.746 --> 00:16:01.316 A:middle
that you may have set
on the sprite or even

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:57.746 --> 00:16:01.316 A:middle
that you may have set
on the sprite or even

00:16:01.316 --> 00:16:03.376 A:middle
from the alpha transparency
information

00:16:03.596 --> 00:16:05.986 A:middle
in the texture that's associated
with that sprite in your game.

00:16:06.286 --> 00:16:09.206 A:middle
This gives you really easy
access to harness the power

00:16:09.456 --> 00:16:11.976 A:middle
of GameplayKits pathfinding
from your SpriteKit app.

00:16:12.516 --> 00:16:17.856 A:middle
[Applause]

00:16:18.356 --> 00:16:19.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TIM ORIOL: As I said before,

00:16:20.136 --> 00:16:22.186 A:middle
the framework really
is only half the story.

00:16:22.646 --> 00:16:25.126 A:middle
We have a number of
really cool enhancements

00:16:25.196 --> 00:16:27.916 A:middle
to our tools this year and I'd
like to turn it over to Norman

00:16:27.916 --> 00:16:28.976 A:middle
to tell you all about it.

00:16:29.516 --> 00:16:34.276 A:middle
[Applause]

00:16:34.776 --> 00:16:35.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; NORMAN WANG: Thanks, Tim.

00:16:37.376 --> 00:16:40.456 A:middle
Building games is a complex
and iteration process.

00:16:40.946 --> 00:16:44.286 A:middle
Various parts of the game needs
to be iterated like game play,

00:16:44.886 --> 00:16:47.476 A:middle
making sure a game
is fun, animation,

00:16:48.066 --> 00:16:50.236 A:middle
making sure the character
movement is fluid,

00:16:50.826 --> 00:16:53.286 A:middle
or art assets, making
sure that the pixels

00:16:53.286 --> 00:16:56.046 A:middle
on the screen really pop.

00:16:56.246 --> 00:16:58.756 A:middle
In addition to the
iteration problem you also,

00:16:58.756 --> 00:17:01.536 A:middle
as a game developer, face
the scalability problem.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:58.756 --> 00:17:01.536 A:middle
as a game developer, face
the scalability problem.

00:17:01.906 --> 00:17:05.386 A:middle
How do I replicate a current
design across multiple levels.

00:17:05.386 --> 00:17:07.776 A:middle
At Apple when we first set

00:17:07.776 --> 00:17:11.496 A:middle
out to design SpriteKit we
wanted not only to provide you

00:17:11.496 --> 00:17:16.886 A:middle
with a high performance and easy
to use API but also the tools

00:17:17.066 --> 00:17:20.425 A:middle
to help you with scalability and
iteration so that we can focus

00:17:20.425 --> 00:17:21.586 A:middle
on just building the game.

00:17:22.556 --> 00:17:24.006 A:middle
Ever since day one release

00:17:24.006 --> 00:17:26.636 A:middle
of the SpriteKit
framework we have created

00:17:26.836 --> 00:17:30.596 A:middle
and continuously added
multiple tools as part of Xcode.

00:17:31.066 --> 00:17:34.536 A:middle
Let me give you a quick tour
of what are the tools available

00:17:34.676 --> 00:17:36.396 A:middle
for you as a SpriteKit user.

00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:40.156 A:middle
The first thing I want to
talk about is texture atlas.

00:17:41.166 --> 00:17:42.236 A:middle
One of the main benefits

00:17:42.236 --> 00:17:45.806 A:middle
of using texture atlas is
performance improvement.

00:17:46.776 --> 00:17:49.806 A:middle
SpriteKit uses texture
atlas to minimize the amount

00:17:49.806 --> 00:17:53.096 A:middle
of draw calls sent out to the
GPU to optimize the efficiency.

00:17:53.756 --> 00:17:57.816 A:middle
We don't want to force our
users to adopt a manual process

00:17:58.136 --> 00:18:01.826 A:middle
by manually building these
texture atlas, [unintelligible]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.136 --> 00:18:01.826 A:middle
by manually building these
texture atlas, [unintelligible]

00:18:02.546 --> 00:18:05.006 A:middle
and every time when the
source acts as a change,

00:18:05.106 --> 00:18:07.476 A:middle
this manual process will
have to be kickedoff again.

00:18:08.196 --> 00:18:11.346 A:middle
Therefore it builds an automatic
texture atlas generator right

00:18:11.346 --> 00:18:12.166 A:middle
inside the Xcode.

00:18:12.796 --> 00:18:15.276 A:middle
To build one of these
atlas is as simple

00:18:15.276 --> 00:18:17.796 A:middle
as dragging a folder
into your workspace.

00:18:18.686 --> 00:18:22.526 A:middle
And we'll do something like this
automatically at build time.

00:18:22.526 --> 00:18:25.216 A:middle
Each of the source images
is automatically going

00:18:25.216 --> 00:18:27.336 A:middle
through a complex
post processing stage.

00:18:27.736 --> 00:18:31.916 A:middle
For example, we trim the alpha
transparent pixels for the image

00:18:32.466 --> 00:18:34.366 A:middle
that doesn't really contribute
anything to the screen.

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:38.836 A:middle
We rotate the image up to 90Â°
if they result a tighter fit

00:18:39.366 --> 00:18:41.206 A:middle
or result a smaller
texture atlas.

00:18:41.986 --> 00:18:46.046 A:middle
For each of the source
images, we also introspect each

00:18:46.046 --> 00:18:47.466 A:middle
of the edges on the image

00:18:47.886 --> 00:18:50.856 A:middle
and if they're fully opaque
we'll perform extrusion

00:18:50.856 --> 00:18:51.436 A:middle
on the edge.

00:18:51.476 --> 00:18:54.276 A:middle
So when you tile these
images on your scene,

00:18:54.376 --> 00:18:57.066 A:middle
you will not see any seams,

00:18:57.246 --> 00:18:59.456 A:middle
that's automatic
texture atlas generation.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:00.446 --> 00:19:02.536 A:middle
This year we have
made that even better.

00:19:03.286 --> 00:19:07.146 A:middle
Now you can generate texture
atlas instead of asset catalog.

00:19:07.686 --> 00:19:09.186 A:middle
There are two major benefits

00:19:09.186 --> 00:19:11.906 A:middle
of generating texture
atlas using asset catalog.

00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:16.006 A:middle
Number one, you have
precise control

00:19:16.006 --> 00:19:18.826 A:middle
of the targeted device
resolutions matching

00:19:18.826 --> 00:19:19.856 A:middle
with your image names.

00:19:20.426 --> 00:19:25.256 A:middle
You have freedom to not follow
the post-fix in your image names

00:19:25.256 --> 00:19:28.506 A:middle
like add 2X or add
2X to the iPhone,

00:19:29.196 --> 00:19:31.196 A:middle
all of that can be
designed right in the UI.

00:19:32.356 --> 00:19:36.876 A:middle
The second benefit is we support
[unintelligible] now inside the

00:19:36.876 --> 00:19:37.606 A:middle
asset catalog.

00:19:38.236 --> 00:19:41.236 A:middle
Each group of the target
resolution are going

00:19:41.236 --> 00:19:43.836 A:middle
to be generated by their
device independent textures.

00:19:44.346 --> 00:19:45.836 A:middle
When the user goes
to the App Store

00:19:45.836 --> 00:19:48.086 A:middle
and downloads your
SpriteKit enabled games,

00:19:48.846 --> 00:19:51.776 A:middle
only the texture atlas
that's relevant to his

00:19:51.776 --> 00:19:53.396 A:middle
or her device will
get downloaded,

00:19:54.056 --> 00:19:57.686 A:middle
not only does this minimize
the amount of bandwidth as well

00:19:57.746 --> 00:20:01.056 A:middle
as install time for the app
to get on the users phone

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:57.746 --> 00:20:01.056 A:middle
as install time for the app
to get on the users phone

00:20:01.416 --> 00:20:06.986 A:middle
but also minimizes the amount
of storage overhead on the app.

00:20:07.256 --> 00:20:10.436 A:middle
In addition, texture atlas
supports on-demand resources.

00:20:10.916 --> 00:20:14.776 A:middle
On-demand resources is a
brand-new API that enables you

00:20:14.776 --> 00:20:18.246 A:middle
to stream in art assets over
the network in the background

00:20:18.316 --> 00:20:19.206 A:middle
when the game is running.

00:20:20.046 --> 00:20:22.096 A:middle
SpriteKit builds that
support right in.

00:20:22.486 --> 00:20:24.886 A:middle
These assets are
identified by tags.

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:28.356 A:middle
Here, for example, my
background elements in Xcode

00:20:28.356 --> 00:20:32.446 A:middle
in Inspector I can specify what
are the tags associated with it.

00:20:33.016 --> 00:20:35.536 A:middle
I'm calling it level
1 and background.

00:20:35.656 --> 00:20:38.516 A:middle
These are the tags, you can
use either of these tags

00:20:38.576 --> 00:20:42.226 A:middle
to retrieve this asset and
start background streaming

00:20:42.486 --> 00:20:44.566 A:middle
when your application
requests it.

00:20:46.536 --> 00:20:51.426 A:middle
Particle effects really help
you set up the game right.

00:20:52.176 --> 00:20:56.846 A:middle
We provide SKEmitterNode as a
very powerful and flexible APIs

00:20:57.066 --> 00:20:58.696 A:middle
in the framework for you to use.

00:20:59.596 --> 00:21:02.856 A:middle
The downside of being
powerful and flexible is

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.596 --> 00:21:02.856 A:middle
The downside of being
powerful and flexible is

00:21:02.856 --> 00:21:05.836 A:middle
that it also comes with 49
properties for you to set.

00:21:07.136 --> 00:21:09.136 A:middle
To set a combination
of permutations

00:21:09.136 --> 00:21:12.806 A:middle
of these 49 properties to
match with the look and feel

00:21:12.806 --> 00:21:15.456 A:middle
that you're going after
is time consuming.

00:21:16.106 --> 00:21:20.316 A:middle
Therefore we build a particle
editor right inside of Xcode

00:21:20.746 --> 00:21:23.076 A:middle
that uses the same
SpriteKit rendering engine

00:21:23.406 --> 00:21:27.186 A:middle
that gives you the visual look
right inside of your work space

00:21:27.186 --> 00:21:31.126 A:middle
so that you can tweak and change
any of these 49 properties

00:21:31.496 --> 00:21:33.296 A:middle
without ever having
to write any lines

00:21:33.296 --> 00:21:35.076 A:middle
of code or rebuild your game.

00:21:35.076 --> 00:21:37.946 A:middle
These particles are
going to be exported

00:21:37.946 --> 00:21:41.936 A:middle
as a really small data file that
can be serialized and deployed

00:21:41.936 --> 00:21:44.676 A:middle
across multiple levels or
across multiple projects.

00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:50.576 A:middle
SpriteKit also supports
Quick Look.

00:21:50.576 --> 00:21:53.176 A:middle
Here for example I'm trying
to learn the new Swift.

00:21:53.696 --> 00:21:57.576 A:middle
I create a brand-new
playground and try to play

00:21:57.576 --> 00:22:00.746 A:middle
around with the SpriteKit
API using the new Swift

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:57.576 --> 00:22:00.746 A:middle
around with the SpriteKit
API using the new Swift

00:22:00.746 --> 00:22:01.686 A:middle
2.0 language.

00:22:02.266 --> 00:22:06.596 A:middle
What I'm doing here is I'm
creating a bad guy character,

00:22:07.266 --> 00:22:09.156 A:middle
called bad guy, which
is a sprite node,

00:22:09.316 --> 00:22:12.226 A:middle
it copied a single texture
called the car hood,

00:22:13.186 --> 00:22:16.956 A:middle
and in addition I create two
children node that appear

00:22:16.956 --> 00:22:21.166 A:middle
under this bad guy, one has
the texture of the roof,

00:22:21.686 --> 00:22:23.626 A:middle
the other one has the
texture of the trunk.

00:22:24.726 --> 00:22:29.326 A:middle
What's happening here, SpriteKit
will do a partial off-screen

00:22:29.326 --> 00:22:31.216 A:middle
rendering of this
subterrain when you try

00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:32.646 A:middle
to introspect the sprite node

00:22:32.886 --> 00:22:36.336 A:middle
and it will provide the result
right inside of the playground

00:22:36.336 --> 00:22:39.546 A:middle
for you so that every step
along the way when you try

00:22:39.546 --> 00:22:42.406 A:middle
to learn a new language or
make changes to the object,

00:22:42.786 --> 00:22:45.586 A:middle
you will see the live changes
right inside of the playground.

00:22:47.176 --> 00:22:50.796 A:middle
In addition the Quicklook
in SpriteKit also supported

00:22:50.796 --> 00:22:54.086 A:middle
when you debug your applications
whether they're in Swift,

00:22:54.846 --> 00:22:57.966 A:middle
Objective-C, whether they
are running on iOS devices

00:22:58.266 --> 00:22:59.586 A:middle
or running on Mac OS X.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:00.456 --> 00:23:03.946 A:middle
So here I'm trying to debug an
application that I have written,

00:23:05.036 --> 00:23:06.356 A:middle
I trigger a break point,

00:23:06.416 --> 00:23:10.126 A:middle
the target process is actually
paused, but we're still able

00:23:10.126 --> 00:23:14.086 A:middle
to wrap the partial screen
rendering of the current texture

00:23:14.706 --> 00:23:15.926 A:middle
and show that in the debugger.

00:23:16.366 --> 00:23:20.826 A:middle
So you know exactly what that
texture is before I go ahead

00:23:20.826 --> 00:23:23.416 A:middle
and grab it to assign
to an SKSpriteNode.

00:23:23.926 --> 00:23:29.826 A:middle
Last year in iOS 8 we
announced a visual scene editor

00:23:29.826 --> 00:23:32.896 A:middle
which will allow you to set up a
full scene layout without having

00:23:32.896 --> 00:23:36.306 A:middle
to write any lines of code.

00:23:36.516 --> 00:23:41.666 A:middle
Not only you can set up the
position, rotation and scale

00:23:41.666 --> 00:23:44.006 A:middle
on each of the available
nodes that are in the scene,

00:23:44.396 --> 00:23:47.816 A:middle
but you can also define its
physics properties like setting

00:23:47.816 --> 00:23:51.506 A:middle
up a graphic, gravities,
mass, frictions,

00:23:52.036 --> 00:23:55.756 A:middle
you can also perform
live simulations

00:23:56.196 --> 00:23:59.126 A:middle
of these physics
simulations without having

00:23:59.126 --> 00:24:01.626 A:middle
to launch your game or
rebuild the application.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.126 --> 00:24:01.626 A:middle
to launch your game or
rebuild the application.

00:24:03.116 --> 00:24:06.946 A:middle
SpriteKit will support some
advanced rendering techniques

00:24:06.946 --> 00:24:08.066 A:middle
like custom shaders.

00:24:08.766 --> 00:24:12.906 A:middle
Here in my level the waterfall
in the background and the fog

00:24:12.906 --> 00:24:15.316 A:middle
on the bottom I actually
implement using two

00:24:15.396 --> 00:24:16.256 A:middle
custom shaders.

00:24:16.726 --> 00:24:20.056 A:middle
To add the shaders,
it is a matter of --

00:24:20.556 --> 00:24:22.846 A:middle
it is as simple as opening
up the assist editor,

00:24:22.956 --> 00:24:25.076 A:middle
it automatically shows
you the current scene

00:24:25.636 --> 00:24:27.656 A:middle
with the shader that's
being rendering

00:24:27.656 --> 00:24:30.136 A:middle
and it will show you
the assistant editor

00:24:30.136 --> 00:24:31.146 A:middle
with the shader source code.

00:24:31.536 --> 00:24:33.356 A:middle
Any live changes you make

00:24:33.356 --> 00:24:35.976 A:middle
in the assistant editor will
automatically recompile the

00:24:35.976 --> 00:24:39.406 A:middle
shader, open up to OpenGL
or Metal and provide you

00:24:39.406 --> 00:24:42.846 A:middle
with a real realtime
preview rather than having

00:24:42.846 --> 00:24:46.086 A:middle
to build a game, go
through the level,

00:24:46.596 --> 00:24:48.586 A:middle
go through the certain
spots and trigger the event

00:24:48.896 --> 00:24:52.626 A:middle
to see whether I'm sending
this stream to OpenGL or Metal,

00:24:52.626 --> 00:24:54.296 A:middle
whether it compiles
successfully or not.

00:24:54.656 --> 00:24:56.386 A:middle
It saves a lot of
iteration time.

00:24:58.116 --> 00:25:00.956 A:middle
This year we have made
a lot of enhancements

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.116 --> 00:25:00.956 A:middle
This year we have made
a lot of enhancements

00:25:00.956 --> 00:25:02.066 A:middle
to the visual scene editor.

00:25:02.066 --> 00:25:05.246 A:middle
The number one requested
feature is custom classes.

00:25:06.266 --> 00:25:11.556 A:middle
Now in the level my hero
character I can specify its

00:25:11.596 --> 00:25:16.156 A:middle
class is called main
character class.

00:25:16.156 --> 00:25:18.666 A:middle
When the scene is
de-serialized at runtime,

00:25:19.006 --> 00:25:21.526 A:middle
whether your application
is written in Objective-C

00:25:21.526 --> 00:25:28.306 A:middle
or Swift the correct class will
be instantiated and created

00:25:28.306 --> 00:25:33.336 A:middle
when the scene is running
and loaded on the scene.

00:25:33.336 --> 00:25:38.576 A:middle
In addition we have been
very busy adding the support

00:25:38.576 --> 00:25:41.156 A:middle
from day one of the
brand-new SKNodes.

00:25:41.566 --> 00:25:44.766 A:middle
Now you can design your
scene with the Camera nodes,

00:25:45.356 --> 00:25:47.486 A:middle
position AudioNode and as well

00:25:47.486 --> 00:25:50.146 A:middle
as the ReferenceNode right
inside of the editor.

00:25:50.486 --> 00:25:53.646 A:middle
It is really cool to be able
to see the camera sending

00:25:53.646 --> 00:25:56.546 A:middle
up the correct scale,
the zoom factor as well

00:25:56.546 --> 00:25:58.976 A:middle
as run actions right inside
of the scene editor rather

00:25:58.976 --> 00:26:01.516 A:middle
than having to rebuild
your game.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:58.976 --> 00:26:01.516 A:middle
than having to rebuild
your game.

00:26:02.106 --> 00:26:06.206 A:middle
You can also set up the
position of the SKAudioNode,

00:26:06.686 --> 00:26:11.866 A:middle
move them around and hear the
actual sound change to make sure

00:26:11.866 --> 00:26:14.186 A:middle
that your effect is set up
correctly on your scene.

00:26:14.786 --> 00:26:18.706 A:middle
Now this year, one of the
most exciting features

00:26:18.706 --> 00:26:21.406 A:middle
on the tools front is
to have the ability

00:26:21.406 --> 00:26:23.086 A:middle
to design complex actions.

00:26:23.956 --> 00:26:26.646 A:middle
You can design a
really complex action

00:26:27.046 --> 00:26:28.846 A:middle
by using the fundamental
building blocks

00:26:28.846 --> 00:26:32.186 A:middle
that we've provided as part
of SpriteKit action runtime.

00:26:32.756 --> 00:26:38.766 A:middle
It is timeline based, also just
like any other editors we have

00:26:38.766 --> 00:26:42.366 A:middle
in Xcode it provides
live visualization.

00:26:43.356 --> 00:26:47.096 A:middle
You can use not only
to create 2D actions,

00:26:47.816 --> 00:26:50.126 A:middle
you can also create
3D animations

00:26:50.276 --> 00:26:52.706 A:middle
for SceneKit, it's
the same editor.

00:26:53.826 --> 00:26:56.206 A:middle
You can also create
cinematic animations

00:26:56.746 --> 00:26:59.606 A:middle
which will be the animations
saved out as part of scene

00:26:59.606 --> 00:27:02.676 A:middle
when the scene is loaded
that automatically gets run

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:59.606 --> 00:27:02.676 A:middle
when the scene is loaded
that automatically gets run

00:27:02.676 --> 00:27:05.326 A:middle
for any node that has
action in a scene.

00:27:06.636 --> 00:27:11.356 A:middle
You can also create interactive
animations like running cycle

00:27:11.706 --> 00:27:14.266 A:middle
or jump animations,
falling off from a ledge

00:27:14.266 --> 00:27:19.006 A:middle
and trigger these animations
with one or two lines of code

00:27:19.946 --> 00:27:21.366 A:middle
at different game
play scenarios.

00:27:25.216 --> 00:27:28.976 A:middle
Here I have a scene, I designed
to move the camera around,

00:27:28.976 --> 00:27:30.436 A:middle
I focus on the main character,

00:27:30.436 --> 00:27:32.126 A:middle
the main character
starts animating,

00:27:32.126 --> 00:27:34.086 A:middle
running the walk cycle, and walk

00:27:34.086 --> 00:27:35.676 A:middle
across the scene,
that's my opening.

00:27:35.736 --> 00:27:42.326 A:middle
You can do that in less
than 5 minutes of your time.

00:27:42.516 --> 00:27:45.486 A:middle
Now another major focus
this year on the tools front

00:27:45.486 --> 00:27:48.106 A:middle
for both 2D and 3D is
to have the ability

00:27:48.106 --> 00:27:50.546 A:middle
of doing referencing
and instancing.

00:27:50.956 --> 00:27:56.666 A:middle
On SpriteKit side with support
references on the actions

00:27:56.716 --> 00:28:00.336 A:middle
as well as references on the
node which is your art assets

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:56.716 --> 00:28:00.336 A:middle
as well as references on the
node which is your art assets

00:28:00.336 --> 00:28:03.056 A:middle
in your scene, these
are reusable components

00:28:03.146 --> 00:28:05.386 A:middle
and they are data files
that can be shared

00:28:05.666 --> 00:28:07.626 A:middle
across multiple projects,

00:28:07.886 --> 00:28:10.066 A:middle
multiple persons
or multiple levels.

00:28:10.936 --> 00:28:12.436 A:middle
To use these reference files,

00:28:12.436 --> 00:28:14.136 A:middle
you don't have to
write any code.

00:28:14.746 --> 00:28:19.386 A:middle
To create the reference
animation is really easy,

00:28:19.736 --> 00:28:24.236 A:middle
we provide a brand new SK
action file template in Xcode 7

00:28:24.236 --> 00:28:27.066 A:middle
and you can a pure
animation file,

00:28:27.466 --> 00:28:31.156 A:middle
in there design all your complex
animation, give it out a name,

00:28:31.486 --> 00:28:34.846 A:middle
each of these actions can be
retrieved with the SKAction,

00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:38.246 A:middle
actionNamed selector to
create the right instance

00:28:38.246 --> 00:28:39.256 A:middle
and to add it to your scene.

00:28:40.006 --> 00:28:44.306 A:middle
Any of the referenced actions,
automatically will be picked out

00:28:44.306 --> 00:28:46.216 A:middle
and reside in object library.

00:28:46.346 --> 00:28:48.686 A:middle
If you want to have
the actions reused

00:28:48.686 --> 00:28:50.986 A:middle
across multiple intro scenes

00:28:50.986 --> 00:28:54.086 A:middle
in different levels it is just
a matter of drag-n-drop these

00:28:54.086 --> 00:28:55.176 A:middle
from the object library.

00:28:56.756 --> 00:28:59.396 A:middle
Creating reference
nodes is also easier.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:00.806 --> 00:29:04.266 A:middle
It is just as simple as
dragging another SKS file

00:29:04.266 --> 00:29:06.696 A:middle
from your work space
to your scene.

00:29:07.546 --> 00:29:09.866 A:middle
These references,
we automatically

00:29:09.866 --> 00:29:12.486 A:middle
in the editor create
SKReferenceNode instances

00:29:12.776 --> 00:29:14.606 A:middle
and set up correct URL for you.

00:29:15.096 --> 00:29:19.896 A:middle
You can also use it, the API
to build a custom collection

00:29:20.406 --> 00:29:23.616 A:middle
of the nodes, for example, if I
have a bird house that I'm going

00:29:23.616 --> 00:29:25.396 A:middle
to be using as a level prop

00:29:25.396 --> 00:29:29.056 A:middle
across multiple levels I
can just build that and have

00:29:29.056 --> 00:29:32.696 A:middle
that instance in multiple
levels and any changes

00:29:32.696 --> 00:29:33.936 A:middle
to the original design

00:29:33.996 --> 00:29:36.506 A:middle
of the bird house will
automatically get reflected

00:29:36.506 --> 00:29:39.146 A:middle
in each of the instances
that use the reference.

00:29:41.816 --> 00:29:45.686 A:middle
Here you can also
manually change

00:29:45.686 --> 00:29:48.596 A:middle
and update the reference
file in the editor as well.

00:29:48.596 --> 00:29:54.916 A:middle
Next, I like to invite Tyler on
stage to give you a quick demo

00:29:55.056 --> 00:29:56.976 A:middle
of these great new
features in Xcode.

00:29:57.516 --> 00:30:02.496 A:middle
[Applause]

[Applause]

00:30:02.996 --> 00:30:03.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TYLER CASELLA:
Thank you Norman.

00:30:03.996 --> 00:30:06.996 A:middle
As you see, we have a lot of
great new additions to SpriteKit

00:30:06.996 --> 00:30:09.596 A:middle
and Xcode 7, and I'd like to
show you how they'll integrate

00:30:09.596 --> 00:30:12.166 A:middle
in your development workflow
by showing you a quick demo

00:30:12.166 --> 00:30:15.246 A:middle
of creating a simple level,
adding a cut scene to it,

00:30:15.576 --> 00:30:17.336 A:middle
and then creating some
interactive game play.

00:30:22.176 --> 00:30:25.526 A:middle
Well see here, I just
started a game project

00:30:25.526 --> 00:30:28.596 A:middle
and I've started a level
within this project.

00:30:28.596 --> 00:30:31.576 A:middle
I've got a player sprite
as well as some platforms.

00:30:32.056 --> 00:30:35.656 A:middle
The first thing I want to do is
to create the environment in it

00:30:35.916 --> 00:30:39.076 A:middle
by adding a background and
some foreground elements.

00:30:39.636 --> 00:30:42.466 A:middle
Previously I would do this
directly into the scene

00:30:42.466 --> 00:30:45.496 A:middle
and then create copies for
each instance that I needed.

00:30:45.896 --> 00:30:48.686 A:middle
This quickly becomes cumbersome
if I need to make changes

00:30:48.686 --> 00:30:51.016 A:middle
because I need to make the
change in many different spots.

00:30:51.306 --> 00:30:53.076 A:middle
It is not easy to reuse.

00:30:53.076 --> 00:30:55.516 A:middle
We have addressed that
with the ReferenceNode.

00:30:56.196 --> 00:30:58.726 A:middle
So see here in a separate
file I've created all

00:30:58.726 --> 00:31:00.856 A:middle
of my elements for
our environment.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.726 --> 00:31:00.856 A:middle
of my elements for
our environment.

00:31:01.096 --> 00:31:03.646 A:middle
I've got a nice background
with the waterfall as well

00:31:03.646 --> 00:31:05.646 A:middle
as a nice foreground fog effect.

00:31:06.396 --> 00:31:08.146 A:middle
What I can do to
reference the contents

00:31:08.176 --> 00:31:10.826 A:middle
of this file is simply
drag it into our level.

00:31:11.246 --> 00:31:13.376 A:middle
Now we've automatically
created a ReferenceNode

00:31:13.576 --> 00:31:14.776 A:middle
with all those elements.

00:31:14.856 --> 00:31:18.816 A:middle
You will notice even the
foreground Z value is preserved

00:31:18.816 --> 00:31:20.356 A:middle
as we add it into our scene.

00:31:21.226 --> 00:31:23.746 A:middle
So go ahead and create a
few copies of these to fill

00:31:23.746 --> 00:31:26.716 A:middle
out our level and you'll
notice that I'm creating copies

00:31:26.716 --> 00:31:28.326 A:middle
of the ReferenceNode itself

00:31:28.586 --> 00:31:31.206 A:middle
and not the actual
individual elements

00:31:31.326 --> 00:31:33.276 A:middle
within our reference scene.

00:31:33.896 --> 00:31:37.296 A:middle
What's great about that is,
later on in my project when I,

00:31:37.606 --> 00:31:39.966 A:middle
for example, want to change
the background texture

00:31:39.966 --> 00:31:41.246 A:middle
because it doesn't quite match

00:31:41.246 --> 00:31:43.736 A:middle
with the platforms I've got
here, I don't have to make

00:31:43.736 --> 00:31:45.786 A:middle
that change on the
three instances I have.

00:31:46.146 --> 00:31:48.136 A:middle
Instead I can go to
our single source

00:31:48.486 --> 00:31:53.486 A:middle
and make this change only once
and that change is echoed to all

00:31:53.486 --> 00:31:55.906 A:middle
of our instances
within our level.

00:31:56.516 --> 00:32:00.646 A:middle
[Applause]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:56.516 --> 00:32:00.646 A:middle
[Applause]

00:32:01.146 --> 00:32:01.726 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TYLER CASELLA: Next I'd

00:32:01.726 --> 00:32:03.846 A:middle
like to create a cut
scene within our level.

00:32:03.846 --> 00:32:07.066 A:middle
I'll do that by using
our new action editor

00:32:07.266 --> 00:32:08.096 A:middle
that we've introduced.

00:32:08.556 --> 00:32:10.836 A:middle
Previously you could only
create actions in code

00:32:10.836 --> 00:32:13.536 A:middle
which is very difficult
to visualize so we wanted

00:32:13.536 --> 00:32:16.696 A:middle
to create an editor that was
easy to create complex actions

00:32:16.696 --> 00:32:19.146 A:middle
from and give you
realtime previews

00:32:19.146 --> 00:32:19.996 A:middle
of what you're creating.

00:32:20.786 --> 00:32:22.376 A:middle
To access the action editor,

00:32:22.376 --> 00:32:23.996 A:middle
you just click the
disclosure button here

00:32:23.996 --> 00:32:26.326 A:middle
in the bottom-left corner and
you'll see you're presented

00:32:26.326 --> 00:32:29.136 A:middle
with all of the nodes in your
scene as well as the timeline

00:32:29.136 --> 00:32:30.876 A:middle
of all of the actions
they contain.

00:32:31.266 --> 00:32:33.416 A:middle
We'll see here our player
has one action on it,

00:32:33.416 --> 00:32:35.136 A:middle
which is an animate
with textures action,

00:32:35.536 --> 00:32:37.366 A:middle
and we've got our
idle frames within it.

00:32:37.486 --> 00:32:38.756 A:middle
So now when I click animate,

00:32:39.036 --> 00:32:41.856 A:middle
we'll see that our player is
running this animate action

00:32:42.146 --> 00:32:42.826 A:middle
within our scene.

00:32:43.216 --> 00:32:46.376 A:middle
Let's go ahead and make a
cut scene within our level,

00:32:46.376 --> 00:32:49.266 A:middle
we're going to make the
player run across the level.

00:32:50.106 --> 00:32:52.016 A:middle
To do that, I'll
start by filtering

00:32:52.016 --> 00:32:54.186 A:middle
down to just our player
interaction editor

00:32:54.986 --> 00:32:57.506 A:middle
and to just the actions
within our object library.

00:32:57.696 --> 00:33:01.276 A:middle
We provide you a set of
building block actions to use

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:57.696 --> 00:33:01.276 A:middle
We provide you a set of
building block actions to use

00:33:01.276 --> 00:33:03.056 A:middle
to create your more
complex actions

00:33:03.056 --> 00:33:04.656 A:middle
which is exactly
what I'm going to do.

00:33:05.056 --> 00:33:08.216 A:middle
We'll start by adding a move
action into our cut scene.

00:33:08.216 --> 00:33:09.206 A:middle
All I have to do is drag it

00:33:09.206 --> 00:33:10.966 A:middle
from the object library
into our timeline.

00:33:11.186 --> 00:33:16.256 A:middle
Now for this movement I'll go
850 units in the X direction

00:33:16.256 --> 00:33:18.246 A:middle
and we're going to ease in
for more natural motion.

00:33:18.246 --> 00:33:20.086 A:middle
Now when I click
animate we'll see

00:33:20.086 --> 00:33:22.226 A:middle
that the player is
running that action.

00:33:22.566 --> 00:33:24.656 A:middle
That was a bit quick, so
let's change the duration

00:33:24.656 --> 00:33:27.436 A:middle
by just dragging out the
action to about 2 seconds.

00:33:27.756 --> 00:33:30.626 A:middle
I'm going to adjust the
scale so now when we run,

00:33:30.836 --> 00:33:32.576 A:middle
the movement has a
much better velocity.

00:33:32.576 --> 00:33:36.216 A:middle
Now I'm going to also make
the player run as he moves

00:33:36.216 --> 00:33:39.596 A:middle
across the screen so I'll add in
an animate with textures action.

00:33:40.336 --> 00:33:42.836 A:middle
To define what animation
we're going to be playing,

00:33:43.006 --> 00:33:45.426 A:middle
I can just go into the
media library and filter

00:33:45.426 --> 00:33:46.746 A:middle
down to our run frames.

00:33:47.336 --> 00:33:49.896 A:middle
I can select them and simply
drag them into our action.

00:33:50.386 --> 00:33:55.006 A:middle
Now when we run we'll see that
the player plays that animation.

00:33:55.406 --> 00:33:58.056 A:middle
But of course we're only
playing it once so we're going

00:33:58.056 --> 00:34:00.476 A:middle
to add a loop so that we
can span the whole time

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:58.056 --> 00:34:00.476 A:middle
to add a loop so that we
can span the whole time

00:34:00.476 --> 00:34:01.546 A:middle
of our movement.

00:34:01.546 --> 00:34:03.916 A:middle
I can create a loop by
clicking this loop button here

00:34:03.916 --> 00:34:05.276 A:middle
in the corner and I'm presented

00:34:05.276 --> 00:34:06.636 A:middle
with all the controls
for looping.

00:34:06.956 --> 00:34:10.426 A:middle
I can increase the number of
iterations, I can decrease

00:34:10.426 --> 00:34:11.636 A:middle
or I can loop indefinitely.

00:34:12.196 --> 00:34:14.516 A:middle
In our case I'm going to
only want to loop twice

00:34:14.516 --> 00:34:16.676 A:middle
and then I'll adjust the
duration to match our movement.

00:34:17.025 --> 00:34:19.106 A:middle
Now we have the player
running across the scene.

00:34:20.346 --> 00:34:22.926 A:middle
Next we've got two
gaps within the level

00:34:22.926 --> 00:34:24.616 A:middle
so let's make the
player jump over them.

00:34:24.616 --> 00:34:30.085 A:middle
In the action editor we're
able to scrub to specific times

00:34:30.085 --> 00:34:33.815 A:middle
within our action so I can scrub
to just before we reach the gap

00:34:33.936 --> 00:34:35.886 A:middle
and we'll add another
movement action.

00:34:36.335 --> 00:34:38.045 A:middle
We'll snap right to
where we're scrubbed.

00:34:39.616 --> 00:34:43.985 A:middle
For this movement we'll move
in the Y direction 100 units

00:34:44.176 --> 00:34:46.496 A:middle
and I'll ease out so that
we slow down as we get

00:34:46.496 --> 00:34:47.496 A:middle
to the top of our jump.

00:34:48.416 --> 00:34:51.306 A:middle
Then I'll scrub once again
towards the middle of our gap

00:34:51.306 --> 00:34:53.436 A:middle
and I'll adjust the duration
so that we reach the top

00:34:53.436 --> 00:34:56.076 A:middle
of our jump right there
in the center of the gap.

00:34:56.786 --> 00:35:00.736 A:middle
Then I'll copy the first part of
our action and simply reverse it

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:56.786 --> 00:35:00.736 A:middle
Then I'll copy the first part of
our action and simply reverse it

00:35:00.886 --> 00:35:02.896 A:middle
to get our full motion
of the jump.

00:35:03.886 --> 00:35:05.486 A:middle
That last step for
our jump is I'm going

00:35:05.486 --> 00:35:07.806 A:middle
to create one more
animation which is going

00:35:07.806 --> 00:35:11.086 A:middle
to have our jump frames so I'll
follow the same process going

00:35:11.086 --> 00:35:14.066 A:middle
to our media library, filter
down to our jump frames

00:35:14.146 --> 00:35:15.266 A:middle
and add them to our action

00:35:16.306 --> 00:35:18.906 A:middle
and now we've got the player
jumping over that first gap.

00:35:19.466 --> 00:35:23.336 A:middle
Of course we have one more
gap so one option I have is

00:35:23.336 --> 00:35:25.876 A:middle
to simply copy these
actions I have just added

00:35:25.876 --> 00:35:28.696 A:middle
and displace them, but then we
run into the same issue we had

00:35:28.696 --> 00:35:31.096 A:middle
with the background where if
I want it make changes to it,

00:35:31.096 --> 00:35:33.756 A:middle
I'm going to have to do it to
every instance I have copied.

00:35:34.096 --> 00:35:37.116 A:middle
It very likely I'm going to
want to reuse these actions

00:35:37.116 --> 00:35:37.976 A:middle
in different levels

00:35:37.976 --> 00:35:39.756 A:middle
or potentially even
a different project.

00:35:40.366 --> 00:35:41.546 A:middle
We've addressed this
the same way

00:35:41.546 --> 00:35:44.076 A:middle
with the background allowing
you to reference actions.

00:35:44.416 --> 00:35:46.636 A:middle
To do that we've introduced
a new file in Xcode

00:35:46.826 --> 00:35:48.526 A:middle
which is the SpriteKit
action file.

00:35:49.276 --> 00:35:51.966 A:middle
This is a file where you can
place these actions with a name

00:35:51.966 --> 00:35:54.096 A:middle
that you can then
reference across scenes,

00:35:54.296 --> 00:35:55.826 A:middle
projects, and in code.

00:35:56.296 --> 00:35:57.816 A:middle
Let's go ahead, make
one of those files

00:35:58.226 --> 00:36:00.676 A:middle
by right clicking our selected
actions and we're going

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:58.226 --> 00:36:00.676 A:middle
by right clicking our selected
actions and we're going

00:36:00.676 --> 00:36:01.756 A:middle
to convert it to a reference.

00:36:02.176 --> 00:36:04.806 A:middle
I'm prompted to give it a
name, so I'll name it jump

00:36:05.216 --> 00:36:07.426 A:middle
and we can select an
action file to put this in,

00:36:07.426 --> 00:36:09.346 A:middle
and in our case we'll
create the new file.

00:36:10.866 --> 00:36:13.736 A:middle
So I'll name this file player
actions because I'm going

00:36:13.736 --> 00:36:16.366 A:middle
to put all the actions related
to the player into this file.

00:36:17.896 --> 00:36:19.466 A:middle
The file is added to our project

00:36:19.556 --> 00:36:22.056 A:middle
and you will see now those
actions that we created

00:36:22.056 --> 00:36:24.426 A:middle
for the jump are within our
file under the name jump

00:36:24.806 --> 00:36:27.836 A:middle
and within our scene
we're simply referencing

00:36:27.906 --> 00:36:28.616 A:middle
those actions.

00:36:29.696 --> 00:36:31.036 A:middle
So now all the actions
that you put

00:36:31.036 --> 00:36:33.426 A:middle
into this file are completely
independent of any scene

00:36:33.426 --> 00:36:35.256 A:middle
or project but you're going
to often want to edit them

00:36:35.256 --> 00:36:36.906 A:middle
in the context of some scene.

00:36:37.416 --> 00:36:40.116 A:middle
We allow you to set a preview
screen that you can assign any

00:36:40.116 --> 00:36:42.546 A:middle
of the actions in your file on
any of the nodes in your scene.

00:36:42.546 --> 00:36:45.376 A:middle
So for example, I can preview my
jump on any node in this scene

00:36:45.576 --> 00:36:46.866 A:middle
or I can set up my own scene

00:36:46.946 --> 00:36:48.696 A:middle
with different orientations
of the player.

00:36:48.966 --> 00:36:52.046 A:middle
For example, I can preview
what this jump action will look

00:36:52.046 --> 00:36:55.106 A:middle
like on the left and right
orientations of my player.

00:36:55.656 --> 00:36:59.186 A:middle
So now on our level I'll
go ahead and scrub back

00:36:59.186 --> 00:37:02.686 A:middle
to our next gap and in our
object library we automatically

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.186 --> 00:37:02.686 A:middle
to our next gap and in our
object library we automatically

00:37:02.686 --> 00:37:04.446 A:middle
populate it with
all of the actions

00:37:04.446 --> 00:37:05.776 A:middle
that are available to reference.

00:37:05.886 --> 00:37:08.956 A:middle
So that jump action that I
just created is automatically

00:37:09.006 --> 00:37:12.036 A:middle
in our object library and
I can just drag it in.

00:37:12.036 --> 00:37:13.366 A:middle
So now we've got our
finished cut scene.

00:37:13.406 --> 00:37:14.526 A:middle
Let's take a look.

00:37:16.656 --> 00:37:17.556 A:middle
That looks great.

00:37:18.356 --> 00:37:20.666 A:middle
Now I want to show you how
you can use these actions

00:37:20.666 --> 00:37:23.156 A:middle
within code itself instead
of just a cut scene.

00:37:23.846 --> 00:37:26.516 A:middle
What I want to do is create a
named action for every state

00:37:26.516 --> 00:37:29.996 A:middle
that the player can be in and
then reference those in code.

00:37:30.256 --> 00:37:35.366 A:middle
I will create a reference, a
referencable action called run

00:37:35.486 --> 00:37:38.976 A:middle
that has our animation and
I'll do the same for our idle.

00:37:39.596 --> 00:37:42.186 A:middle
I'll go ahead and delete these

00:37:42.186 --> 00:37:44.356 A:middle
because we'll do this
interactively now

00:37:44.706 --> 00:37:48.166 A:middle
and you can see in our action
file we now have the three

00:37:48.166 --> 00:37:50.256 A:middle
states present within this file.

00:37:50.666 --> 00:37:52.626 A:middle
Now to use these
within code all you have

00:37:52.626 --> 00:37:54.626 A:middle
to do is use the new
selectors we have introduced,

00:37:54.986 --> 00:37:57.066 A:middle
the action name selectors
providing them

00:37:57.066 --> 00:37:58.956 A:middle
with the names we have just
created the actions with,

00:37:59.276 --> 00:38:00.966 A:middle
idle, run, and jump.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:59.276 --> 00:38:00.966 A:middle
idle, run, and jump.

00:38:01.666 --> 00:38:04.516 A:middle
Now when I run our game
you can see the actions

00:38:04.516 --> 00:38:07.356 A:middle
that I have just created are
being used in the game itself.

00:38:08.176 --> 00:38:08.876 A:middle
Interactively.

00:38:09.866 --> 00:38:11.856 A:middle
The real power of this
comes when you want

00:38:11.856 --> 00:38:12.986 A:middle
to make a change
to your actions.

00:38:13.016 --> 00:38:15.006 A:middle
I can go in my action
file and let's

00:38:15.006 --> 00:38:18.116 A:middle
for example make the player
do a flip when we jump.

00:38:18.116 --> 00:38:22.636 A:middle
I can go in here and I can add
a rotate action to the jump,

00:38:23.336 --> 00:38:27.786 A:middle
give it a value of negative
360, ease in and out

00:38:27.786 --> 00:38:30.156 A:middle
and now I run the game without
even recompiling our game,

00:38:30.556 --> 00:38:31.436 A:middle
we can see the changes

00:38:31.436 --> 00:38:33.976 A:middle
that I have made are now
applied to our player.

00:38:34.516 --> 00:38:39.686 A:middle
[Applause]

00:38:40.186 --> 00:38:42.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TYLER CASELLA: So now
the level looks pretty good

00:38:42.316 --> 00:38:43.106 A:middle
so the last thing I want

00:38:43.106 --> 00:38:45.186 A:middle
to do is create a
nice cinematic opening

00:38:45.186 --> 00:38:47.046 A:middle
to really introduce the
player to the level.

00:38:47.496 --> 00:38:51.686 A:middle
I can do that by creating an
SKCameraNode and into our scene.

00:38:52.196 --> 00:38:54.956 A:middle
The camera node let's us
define a Viewport within it

00:38:55.126 --> 00:38:57.116 A:middle
and we can go ahead
and assign our scene

00:38:57.316 --> 00:38:59.316 A:middle
to use the camera
I've just added.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:00.186 --> 00:39:02.696 A:middle
For our cinematic opening
I'm going to start us off

00:39:02.696 --> 00:39:05.526 A:middle
in the corner here and I'll
have the camera zoomed in.

00:39:09.776 --> 00:39:12.246 A:middle
I'm going to zoom in
on the fog over here.

00:39:12.726 --> 00:39:15.446 A:middle
What's great is, because it
is just an SKNode I can apply

00:39:15.446 --> 00:39:16.526 A:middle
actions to the camera.

00:39:17.206 --> 00:39:19.166 A:middle
I'll filter down
to just our camera

00:39:19.866 --> 00:39:21.936 A:middle
and then I'll add
a move 2 action.

00:39:22.246 --> 00:39:24.776 A:middle
What I'm going to do for our
cinematic opening is pan the

00:39:24.776 --> 00:39:26.426 A:middle
camera over to the
center of our level

00:39:26.606 --> 00:39:27.986 A:middle
and zoom out at the same time.

00:39:28.296 --> 00:39:32.746 A:middle
For our move 2 I'll use this
platforms X value as our center,

00:39:32.806 --> 00:39:36.826 A:middle
507, and I'll also want
to center it in the Y

00:39:37.036 --> 00:39:39.596 A:middle
which is 384 units
and we're going

00:39:39.596 --> 00:39:40.866 A:middle
to want this to ease in and out.

00:39:41.796 --> 00:39:44.256 A:middle
I'm going to move our action
to start about half a second

00:39:44.256 --> 00:39:46.086 A:middle
after we begin our
scene and I'm going

00:39:46.086 --> 00:39:48.456 A:middle
to have it take three
seconds to pan over.

00:39:48.916 --> 00:39:52.906 A:middle
I'll also add a scale 2 action
and give it a half second offset

00:39:52.946 --> 00:39:57.636 A:middle
from our move and have it end at
the same time as our movement.

00:39:58.036 --> 00:39:59.386 A:middle
Now within that short amount

00:39:59.386 --> 00:40:00.986 A:middle
of time we have created
the cinematic opening,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.386 --> 00:40:00.986 A:middle
of time we have created
the cinematic opening,

00:40:01.146 --> 00:40:02.176 A:middle
and we have finished our level,

00:40:02.396 --> 00:40:04.326 A:middle
so let's take a look
at how it looks.

00:40:11.876 --> 00:40:14.486 A:middle
So that's just a taste
of what you're able to do

00:40:14.596 --> 00:40:16.916 A:middle
with SpriteKit and Xcode 7 now.

00:40:17.516 --> 00:40:23.156 A:middle
[Applause]

00:40:23.656 --> 00:40:25.276 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TYLER CASELLA: And with that,
I would like to hand it off back

00:40:25.406 --> 00:40:27.946 A:middle
to Tim to summarize for you.

00:40:29.406 --> 00:40:30.566 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TIM ORIOL: Thanks, Tyler.

00:40:30.676 --> 00:40:32.346 A:middle
That is really, really
cool stuff.

00:40:32.346 --> 00:40:35.396 A:middle
I think as you all can see,

00:40:35.396 --> 00:40:37.306 A:middle
it is going to be an
extremely exciting year

00:40:37.306 --> 00:40:38.466 A:middle
for SpriteKit developers.

00:40:38.706 --> 00:40:41.106 A:middle
We've added the AudioNode,
we've added the CameraNode,

00:40:41.106 --> 00:40:43.046 A:middle
we have reference
actions and nodes,

00:40:43.506 --> 00:40:46.446 A:middle
we have a brand-new timeline
based action editor built right

00:40:46.446 --> 00:40:47.106 A:middle
into Xcode.

00:40:47.436 --> 00:40:50.926 A:middle
We have integrated our texture
atlases with the Asset Catalog

00:40:50.926 --> 00:40:52.626 A:middle
to give you access
to new features

00:40:52.866 --> 00:40:55.086 A:middle
like On-Demand Resources
and app thinning

00:40:55.646 --> 00:40:59.096 A:middle
and we have also made SpriteKit
Metal backed on every device

00:40:59.126 --> 00:41:01.976 A:middle
that supports it and
provides you easy access

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:59.126 --> 00:41:01.976 A:middle
that supports it and
provides you easy access

00:41:02.086 --> 00:41:03.836 A:middle
to the new GamePlayKit
framework.

00:41:04.286 --> 00:41:08.166 A:middle
