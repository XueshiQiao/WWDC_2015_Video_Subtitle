00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:21.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the 2015 Apple Design Awards

00:00:21.936 --> 00:00:26.596 A:middle
and welcome your host for
this evening, John Geleynse.

00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:34.596 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:35.696 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JOHN GELEYNSE:
Well, good evening.

00:00:35.696 --> 00:00:37.296 A:middle
It is -- or good afternoon.

00:00:37.296 --> 00:00:38.546 A:middle
It's still afternoon, actually.

00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:40.226 A:middle
It is great to be here.

00:00:40.226 --> 00:00:44.126 A:middle
It's a great moment
to end off this day.

00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:46.506 A:middle
I know it's been long, many of
you have been waiting in lines

00:00:46.506 --> 00:00:47.746 A:middle
around the building to get

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:50.446 A:middle
into the Keynote,
and that was a blast.

00:00:50.796 --> 00:00:52.476 A:middle
The Keynote was a blast, too.

00:00:53.016 --> 00:00:55.706 A:middle
And then you came into
-- you got your lunch,

00:00:55.706 --> 00:00:59.236 A:middle
then you had State of the Union,
and that was a great session.

00:00:59.436 --> 00:01:03.526 A:middle
And now we want to finish
the day by taking a moment

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.436 --> 00:01:03.526 A:middle
And now we want to finish
the day by taking a moment

00:01:03.526 --> 00:01:05.646 A:middle
to celebrate the work that some

00:01:05.646 --> 00:01:07.536 A:middle
of you have done that's
been extraordinary.

00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:10.426 A:middle
Many of you do -- all of
you do extraordinary work,

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:13.376 A:middle
but there are some that
stand out from the rest,

00:01:13.376 --> 00:01:15.296 A:middle
and we want to take
a few moments

00:01:15.336 --> 00:01:17.996 A:middle
to just celebrate some
excellence in software design.

00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:22.956 A:middle
Now, to begin this
evening and this ceremony,

00:01:22.956 --> 00:01:26.806 A:middle
I want to just kick off with a
video, which is a retrospective

00:01:26.806 --> 00:01:29.426 A:middle
of the winners from
the last 14 years.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:26.536 A:middle
You know, time flies;
doesn't it?

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:30.826 A:middle
How many of you are familiar
with so many of those apps?

00:03:30.916 --> 00:03:32.456 A:middle
You played with those games.

00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:34.896 A:middle
You played with those
productivity tools,

00:03:34.896 --> 00:03:36.636 A:middle
some of those design tools.

00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:38.416 A:middle
And I had to demo
every one of them

00:03:38.416 --> 00:03:40.446 A:middle
on this stage over the years.

00:03:40.766 --> 00:03:44.336 A:middle
And this is just some
of those that came --

00:03:44.336 --> 00:03:47.146 A:middle
that you saw a moment ago coming
through for the last 14 years.

00:03:47.536 --> 00:03:51.186 A:middle
Those 14 years represent
14 years of Design Awards

00:03:51.186 --> 00:03:55.346 A:middle
since OS X was announced,
Mac OS X entered the stage,

00:03:55.546 --> 00:03:58.276 A:middle
and we had developers creating
apps right from day one.

00:03:58.776 --> 00:04:00.796 A:middle
And then, of course, the
App Store came and iOS

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.776 --> 00:04:00.796 A:middle
And then, of course, the
App Store came and iOS

00:04:00.796 --> 00:04:02.526 A:middle
and everything that
we've known since then.

00:04:02.996 --> 00:04:05.656 A:middle
So many of you might be familiar
with the most recent ones

00:04:05.656 --> 00:04:09.076 A:middle
that were shown, and if you
just take a look at this list --

00:04:09.076 --> 00:04:12.276 A:middle
and this isn't to pick off
the best of the 14 years --

00:04:12.276 --> 00:04:14.296 A:middle
but these are some notable
ones that I just wanted

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:15.216 A:middle
to highlight for a minute.

00:04:16.646 --> 00:04:20.396 A:middle
You know, Starry Night Backyard,
I remember showing that off.

00:04:20.396 --> 00:04:24.476 A:middle
That was incredible in the
first days of Mac OS X.

00:04:24.476 --> 00:04:28.576 A:middle
Macnification, this
great app for science.

00:04:28.576 --> 00:04:32.336 A:middle
Delicious Library 2, this
whole genre of apps that came

00:04:32.336 --> 00:04:35.606 A:middle
out in the early days of Mac OS
X that redefined the experience

00:04:35.606 --> 00:04:39.236 A:middle
for so many of us and actually
forced -- well, not forced --

00:04:39.236 --> 00:04:40.996 A:middle
but got people excited

00:04:40.996 --> 00:04:43.796 A:middle
to purchase a Mac just
to use those apps.

00:04:43.846 --> 00:04:45.666 A:middle
MLB.com At Bat.

00:04:45.666 --> 00:04:47.216 A:middle
Flight Control.

00:04:47.216 --> 00:04:49.326 A:middle
Who didn't play Flight
Control in the first days

00:04:49.376 --> 00:04:51.536 A:middle
of the App Store, right?

00:04:51.536 --> 00:04:54.946 A:middle
Paper for scientific research,
and then Monument Valley,

00:04:55.256 --> 00:04:58.346 A:middle
Infinity Blade, incredible apps.

00:04:58.956 --> 00:05:05.686 A:middle
What's interesting is that
these apps have set the standard

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:58.956 --> 00:05:05.686 A:middle
What's interesting is that
these apps have set the standard

00:05:05.686 --> 00:05:07.616 A:middle
for so many things; right?

00:05:07.956 --> 00:05:09.976 A:middle
They've set the standard
for the user experience

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.176 A:middle
that we expect on
these platforms.

00:05:12.596 --> 00:05:17.046 A:middle
These folks were pioneers in
many ways, not just these apps,

00:05:17.046 --> 00:05:20.056 A:middle
but the apps that showed up
across the last 14 years.

00:05:20.576 --> 00:05:23.766 A:middle
And I think the -- what's really
cool way to think about it is

00:05:23.766 --> 00:05:27.686 A:middle
that in so many ways, each of
the winners each year stood

00:05:27.946 --> 00:05:31.196 A:middle
on the shoulders of the
winners from the previous year.

00:05:31.936 --> 00:05:34.646 A:middle
Because so many of these
apps defined a new standard,

00:05:34.916 --> 00:05:37.616 A:middle
a benchmark in performance
or in usability,

00:05:37.986 --> 00:05:40.926 A:middle
and they inspired the rest of
you, inspired so many people

00:05:41.306 --> 00:05:43.096 A:middle
to go off and create
the next great thing.

00:05:44.346 --> 00:05:49.406 A:middle
Now, these apps every
year we've judged the apps

00:05:49.406 --> 00:05:51.486 A:middle
with the same set of
criteria, basically.

00:05:51.916 --> 00:05:53.846 A:middle
We've looked at delightful apps.

00:05:53.906 --> 00:05:55.796 A:middle
These are apps that
invite people to play

00:05:55.796 --> 00:05:58.066 A:middle
or get real things done; right?

00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.986 A:middle
They are satisfying;
they are rewarding.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:00.956 --> 00:06:02.876 A:middle
We've always looked
for innovative apps,

00:06:02.876 --> 00:06:07.686 A:middle
winners that have this spark
of brilliance that it's hard

00:06:07.686 --> 00:06:10.606 A:middle
to define, but you know
it when you see it.

00:06:11.156 --> 00:06:13.606 A:middle
There's state-of-the-art
apps that are modern.

00:06:13.726 --> 00:06:15.776 A:middle
They are platform
differentiating.

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:20.426 A:middle
They're high performance; they
have high-end capabilities,

00:06:20.426 --> 00:06:21.786 A:middle
and they are superprecise.

00:06:23.326 --> 00:06:25.056 A:middle
We look for apps
that are engaging.

00:06:25.576 --> 00:06:28.006 A:middle
Engagement means that
people keep coming back

00:06:28.136 --> 00:06:29.126 A:middle
to use these apps.

00:06:29.536 --> 00:06:30.886 A:middle
Some of the games
that were shown,

00:06:30.886 --> 00:06:32.586 A:middle
some of the productivity
tools are things

00:06:32.586 --> 00:06:33.776 A:middle
that we can't live without.

00:06:34.386 --> 00:06:36.076 A:middle
We can't live without
playing these games,

00:06:36.076 --> 00:06:37.906 A:middle
and we keep coming back
to them again and again.

00:06:38.916 --> 00:06:41.126 A:middle
We look for apps
that are enabling.

00:06:41.176 --> 00:06:44.426 A:middle
And great Apple Design
Award-winning apps

00:06:44.806 --> 00:06:47.186 A:middle
that are enabling
allow you to do things

00:06:47.186 --> 00:06:49.926 A:middle
that you could never
do before in new ways.

00:06:50.136 --> 00:06:53.096 A:middle
And lastly, we look
for designed apps.

00:06:53.566 --> 00:06:57.206 A:middle
These are apps that are deeply
considered, that are familiar,

00:06:57.596 --> 00:07:00.096 A:middle
they're appealing,
they're attractive,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:57.596 --> 00:07:00.096 A:middle
they're appealing,
they're attractive,

00:07:00.406 --> 00:07:02.756 A:middle
and they're super intuitive
to use for the people

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:03.946 A:middle
that they were created for.

00:07:05.016 --> 00:07:07.806 A:middle
So, a quick summary of
how we pick the apps.

00:07:07.936 --> 00:07:10.386 A:middle
We've always picked them
in basically the same way.

00:07:10.386 --> 00:07:12.916 A:middle
We've always used essentially
this set of criteria,

00:07:13.556 --> 00:07:16.786 A:middle
and this is the criteria
that we used for this year

00:07:17.146 --> 00:07:19.356 A:middle
to pick tonight's winners.

00:07:19.676 --> 00:07:23.016 A:middle
I'd like to invite my
colleague, Shaan Pruden,

00:07:23.086 --> 00:07:26.456 A:middle
on stage to award
tonight's winners.

00:07:27.516 --> 00:07:35.016 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:07:35.516 --> 00:07:35.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; SHAAN PRUDEN: Hello.

00:07:36.746 --> 00:07:39.656 A:middle
This year we will be honoring
ten apps from categories

00:07:39.656 --> 00:07:42.936 A:middle
across the App Store, but first
we wanted to take a moment

00:07:43.186 --> 00:07:45.976 A:middle
and honor two students among
our scholarship winners.

00:07:46.556 --> 00:07:49.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JOHN GELEYNSE: Now,
the students we are

00:07:49.816 --> 00:07:53.246 A:middle
about to award are scholarship
winners for this year,

00:07:53.916 --> 00:07:56.476 A:middle
but in the process of looking
at the scholarship apps,

00:07:57.006 --> 00:07:58.996 A:middle
we discovered some apps
that they, themselves,

00:07:58.996 --> 00:08:00.716 A:middle
had also written
for the App Store,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.996 --> 00:08:00.716 A:middle
had also written
for the App Store,

00:08:01.206 --> 00:08:03.316 A:middle
and we were pretty impressed
with some of these apps

00:08:03.356 --> 00:08:05.476 A:middle
that were on the App Store
by these scholarship winners.

00:08:05.476 --> 00:08:08.166 A:middle
So the two awards
tonight are going to go

00:08:08.236 --> 00:08:10.046 A:middle
to developer scholarship winners

00:08:10.086 --> 00:08:11.186 A:middle
who have an app on
the App Store.

00:08:11.686 --> 00:08:14.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; SHAAN PRUDEN: And our first
student winner is Elementary

00:08:14.666 --> 00:08:16.086 A:middle
Minute by Klemens Strasser.

00:08:16.316 --> 00:08:24.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The idea for the
app came to Klemens

00:08:24.306 --> 00:08:30.326 A:middle
in April 2014 while
sitting in his room thinking

00:08:30.326 --> 00:08:32.446 A:middle
about the possibility of
having a quiz on his wrist.

00:08:32.446 --> 00:08:34.356 A:middle
Since there wasn't
an Apple Watch yet,

00:08:34.696 --> 00:08:36.956 A:middle
Klemens developed
it for the iPhone.

00:08:50.116 --> 00:08:50.896 A:middle

Elementary Minute is a
fast-paced trivia game

00:08:56.776 --> 00:08:59.006 A:middle
where you are presenting
with statements on topics

00:08:59.006 --> 00:09:01.526 A:middle
that include math,
geography, and famous people.

00:09:03.536 --> 00:09:05.166 A:middle
if the statements
are true or false.

00:09:05.506 --> 00:09:06.876 A:middle
This app was created by Klemens,

00:09:06.876 --> 00:09:08.086 A:middle
who is a computer
science student

00:09:08.086 --> 00:09:10.156 A:middle
at Technical University
in Graz, Austria.

Austria, right.

Big cheer down in front here.

00:09:20.006 --> 00:09:22.696 A:middle
We Picked Elementary Minute as
a student Design Award winner

00:09:22.696 --> 00:09:26.796 A:middle
because we loved the design, it
was super simple, and it was one

00:09:26.796 --> 00:09:30.416 A:middle
of the first games that
came out for Apple Watch.

00:09:30.986 --> 00:09:34.326 A:middle
It's built, obviously, on UIKit
and those sorts of technologies.

00:09:34.326 --> 00:09:35.746 A:middle
It's integrated with
Game Center,

00:09:35.746 --> 00:09:38.286 A:middle
and it has a clever
two-game mode.

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:41.906 A:middle
You can do a quick five-second
quiz, trivia quiz on your wrist,

00:09:41.906 --> 00:09:42.946 A:middle
which is perfect for the Watch,

00:09:43.446 --> 00:09:46.016 A:middle
and you can do a one-minute
quiz both on Apple Watch

00:09:46.176 --> 00:09:48.356 A:middle
and on iPhone, and
we just thought

00:09:48.356 --> 00:09:51.846 A:middle
that the way this was done
was really well executed,

00:09:51.846 --> 00:09:52.926 A:middle
so congratulations.

00:09:53.616 --> 00:09:54.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; SHAAN PRUDEN: And
that's Elementary Minute.

he convinced Gabriel

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.286 A:middle
to attend the same course.

00:10:25.866 --> 00:10:28.416 A:middle
One day while discussing what it
was like when they were bullied

00:10:28.416 --> 00:10:30.346 A:middle
as kids, they decided
to create a game

00:10:30.346 --> 00:10:31.846 A:middle
that reflected their experience.

00:10:40.166 --> 00:10:40.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; SHAAN PRUDEN:
Congratulations.

00:10:45.396 --> 00:10:46.836 A:middle
Jump-O is a minimalist game

00:10:46.836 --> 00:10:48.346 A:middle
where you play Roundy
the circle,

00:10:48.346 --> 00:10:51.106 A:middle
overcoming the dangers presented
by the squareish world.

00:10:51.686 --> 00:10:54.296 A:middle
It was created by two
university students from Brazil

00:10:54.296 --> 00:10:56.206 A:middle
and features beautiful
hand-drawn puzzles.

00:10:58.126 --> 00:10:59.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JOHN GELEYNSE: You
know what's really fun

00:10:59.066 --> 00:11:01.586 A:middle
for us actually at Apple
is these folks took some

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.066 --> 00:11:01.586 A:middle
for us actually at Apple
is these folks took some

00:11:01.586 --> 00:11:03.976 A:middle
of the iOS training
courses that are in Brazil

00:11:03.976 --> 00:11:07.196 A:middle
and gained some experience
there to build this game.

00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:10.326 A:middle
We picked jump-O as a
student Design Award winner

00:11:10.326 --> 00:11:14.066 A:middle
because of its unique minimalist
design, as Shaan mentioned.

00:11:14.396 --> 00:11:16.936 A:middle
It's built on Game
Center, it uses Sprite Kit

00:11:16.936 --> 00:11:19.586 A:middle
for scene management
and game physics.

00:11:19.976 --> 00:11:21.886 A:middle
The input of the
game is super simple.

00:11:21.886 --> 00:11:23.756 A:middle
It's tap and device motion.

00:11:24.086 --> 00:11:28.206 A:middle
And it's got great
responsiveness, 68 worlds,

00:11:28.206 --> 00:11:31.486 A:middle
48 levels, just a
really fun game

00:11:31.696 --> 00:11:34.326 A:middle
that we thought was just
really, really well done,

00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:36.536 A:middle
and one of those games
that seems easy to learn

00:11:36.856 --> 00:11:39.706 A:middle
but it's hard to
master in that genre.

00:11:39.706 --> 00:11:41.936 A:middle
So congratulations,
great work, guys.

Our first winner is an
imagination-stirring puzzle.

Our first winner is an
imagination-stirring puzzle.

00:12:05.616 --> 00:12:08.976 A:middle
It is Shadowmatic by
Triada Studio Games.

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:18.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Triada Studio was
established in Armenia in 1993

00:12:18.576 --> 00:12:20.366 A:middle
as a computer graphics
and animation studio,

00:12:20.366 --> 00:12:23.546 A:middle
and they successfully work on
TV commercials, visual effects

00:12:23.606 --> 00:12:26.116 A:middle
for movies, and various
other animation projects.

00:12:26.196 --> 00:12:28.856 A:middle
In 2007, they thought about
branching into video games,

00:12:28.906 --> 00:12:30.506 A:middle
began building a game engine.

00:12:30.566 --> 00:12:32.526 A:middle
The four-person game
team started work

00:12:32.526 --> 00:12:36.966 A:middle
on Shadowmatic in March 2012.

00:12:38.876 --> 00:12:40.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; SHAAN PRUDEN:
Shadowmatic is a unique twist

00:12:40.666 --> 00:12:41.806 A:middle
on shadow puppets.

00:12:42.386 --> 00:12:43.366 A:middle
I don't want to stand
in their way.

00:12:44.876 --> 00:12:47.236 A:middle
Rotate abstract objects
in a spotlight

00:12:47.576 --> 00:12:50.496 A:middle
to find recognizable silhouettes
in the projected shadow

00:12:50.496 --> 00:12:52.646 A:middle
that are relevant to the
surrounding environment.

00:12:56.056 --> 00:12:56.616 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JOHN GELEYNSE: All right.

00:12:56.616 --> 00:12:58.556 A:middle
So we picked Shadowmatic
as a winner

00:12:58.556 --> 00:13:03.516 A:middle
since it's ornately crafted
-- bit of feedback --

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:58.556 --> 00:13:03.516 A:middle
since it's ornately crafted
-- bit of feedback --

00:13:03.876 --> 00:13:06.666 A:middle
super imaginative, and
really well executed.

00:13:06.796 --> 00:13:09.356 A:middle
And I'd like to show
this to you now.

00:13:10.186 --> 00:13:12.446 A:middle
So let's get into the
level -- let's turn it off.

00:13:12.576 --> 00:13:15.216 A:middle
Let's get into the main menu.

00:13:15.286 --> 00:13:18.866 A:middle
So what you see here is just
there's device motion that's

00:13:18.866 --> 00:13:22.456 A:middle
affecting the view
into this main menu.

00:13:22.666 --> 00:13:24.936 A:middle
I can interact with objects,
which is no big deal,

00:13:24.936 --> 00:13:26.256 A:middle
but I am just showing
you the attention

00:13:26.256 --> 00:13:28.616 A:middle
to detail that's
even at this level.

00:13:28.616 --> 00:13:31.326 A:middle
And straightaway you hear
this ambient sound track,

00:13:31.466 --> 00:13:34.516 A:middle
and it's a beautiful sound
track throughout the game,

00:13:34.516 --> 00:13:37.056 A:middle
and it's available for
purchase on iTunes even.

00:13:37.676 --> 00:13:40.816 A:middle
So let me just go into
this second level here

00:13:41.556 --> 00:13:42.796 A:middle
and show you how this works.

00:13:43.066 --> 00:13:44.866 A:middle
If you play the game,
you already know.

00:13:45.106 --> 00:13:47.396 A:middle
If you've not played the game,
this is a good level to start

00:13:47.396 --> 00:13:49.106 A:middle
at to show you how it all works.

00:13:49.706 --> 00:13:51.506 A:middle
So basically what we
are doing is taking one

00:13:51.506 --> 00:13:54.496 A:middle
of these objects here, which is
represented at various levels

00:13:54.496 --> 00:13:56.926 A:middle
with ceramics and metal
and wood and all kinds

00:13:56.926 --> 00:13:58.746 A:middle
of different materials that
are beautifully rendered

00:13:58.746 --> 00:14:02.836 A:middle
in the scene, and you take one
finger to rotate it around,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:58.746 --> 00:14:02.836 A:middle
in the scene, and you take one
finger to rotate it around,

00:14:02.836 --> 00:14:04.696 A:middle
and you take two
fingers to twist it.

00:14:05.146 --> 00:14:08.176 A:middle
And essentially, what you are
trying to do is figure out what,

00:14:08.256 --> 00:14:09.446 A:middle
you know, shadow it is

00:14:09.856 --> 00:14:11.546 A:middle
that you're trying
to build on the wall.

00:14:11.546 --> 00:14:13.416 A:middle
So I am going to
rotate it slightly,

00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:15.496 A:middle
looks like I am getting
some kind of a handle there.

00:14:16.206 --> 00:14:21.536 A:middle
And you'll notice on the bottom
of the screen there's some dots

00:14:21.536 --> 00:14:25.326 A:middle
that may light up here soon
if I get close to what it is

00:14:25.326 --> 00:14:28.146 A:middle
that I'm -- yeah, as
soon as I get close

00:14:28.226 --> 00:14:30.796 A:middle
to the puzzle I am trying to
solve, I get this feedback

00:14:30.796 --> 00:14:32.296 A:middle
on these glowing
dots at the bottom.

00:14:32.736 --> 00:14:35.186 A:middle
And so now I think I am pretty
close to something that looks

00:14:35.186 --> 00:14:39.186 A:middle
like a teapot, so there we go.

00:14:39.326 --> 00:14:42.056 A:middle
I get the six dots, and I
figured out this puzzle.

00:14:42.376 --> 00:14:45.506 A:middle
And every level is like this,
and obviously, you're timed.

00:14:45.696 --> 00:14:47.056 A:middle
As you go up through the levels,

00:14:47.056 --> 00:14:48.506 A:middle
it gets more and
more complicated.

00:14:48.856 --> 00:14:52.616 A:middle
We love the parallax effect
that looks like you are looking

00:14:52.706 --> 00:14:54.436 A:middle
into a window in the scene.

00:14:54.736 --> 00:14:58.416 A:middle
We love the high-resolution
rendering, the high fidelity

totally makes an Apple Design

But soon after graduating,

00:15:39.386 --> 00:15:42.106 A:middle
he discovered he could combine
his particular visual imagery

00:15:42.306 --> 00:15:44.676 A:middle
with his lifelong love of
animation to create responsive,

00:15:44.676 --> 00:15:46.786 A:middle

Poke, prod, drag,
and spin objects

where letters are magically
transformed into words.

00:16:18.096 --> 00:16:23.696 A:middle

its outstanding creativity,

I want to show this to you now.

00:16:32.346 --> 00:16:37.066 A:middle
So pick the first letter.

00:16:37.066 --> 00:16:40.116 A:middle
Right from the start you
see this torn fabric effect,

00:16:40.206 --> 00:16:41.756 A:middle
which is the beginning
of the animations.

00:16:42.246 --> 00:16:45.186 A:middle
I tap on these letters,
and they start to interact.

00:16:45.186 --> 00:16:48.746 A:middle
I am simply tapping, pinching,
zooming, whatever I want to do,

00:16:48.846 --> 00:16:51.116 A:middle
whatever the child would want
to do, whatever the student

00:16:51.116 --> 00:16:55.716 A:middle
of letters would want to do, and
you get these scenes that reveal

00:16:55.716 --> 00:16:56.976 A:middle
as you interact with
the letters.

00:16:57.466 --> 00:17:00.866 A:middle
So as I start to stroke
the A and move upwards,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:57.466 --> 00:17:00.866 A:middle
So as I start to stroke
the A and move upwards,

00:17:01.636 --> 00:17:05.026 A:middle
I now get the word Arch, and
the narrator would tell me

00:17:05.026 --> 00:17:05.715 A:middle
that word.

00:17:05.715 --> 00:17:07.556 A:middle
It begins with A.

00:17:07.556 --> 00:17:10.386 A:middle
As I play with the scene,
suddenly it starts to move.

00:17:10.826 --> 00:17:14.086 A:middle
I get this effect of ambling.

00:17:14.816 --> 00:17:16.945 A:middle
So you can continue to
play with these letters,

00:17:16.945 --> 00:17:18.356 A:middle
and you learn more
and more words

00:17:18.356 --> 00:17:19.415 A:middle
that begin with that letter.

00:17:19.886 --> 00:17:22.465 A:middle
And kids, students, you
know, learning English

00:17:22.465 --> 00:17:23.826 A:middle
as a second language, whatever,

00:17:24.106 --> 00:17:27.236 A:middle
are going to learn these
characters and want

00:17:27.236 --> 00:17:28.506 A:middle
to keep coming back
to this game.

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:31.346 A:middle
Let me just show you the G.

00:17:31.956 --> 00:17:34.276 A:middle
My last name starts with
G, I like the letter.

00:17:34.656 --> 00:17:35.326 A:middle
Let's go in.

00:17:35.326 --> 00:17:37.866 A:middle
We tap on it a few times,
it goes three-dimensional.

00:17:38.286 --> 00:17:40.316 A:middle
I pinch on it, it
becomes a guitar.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:42.856 A:middle
You can look at the
attention to detail here

00:17:43.406 --> 00:17:49.026 A:middle
because I can play individual
strings, but if I start

00:17:49.076 --> 00:17:54.066 A:middle
to strum the guitar, a
garden begins to grow.

00:17:54.066 --> 00:17:55.886 A:middle
Kids just love this
stuff, right?

00:17:55.886 --> 00:17:58.076 A:middle
It's just surprising,
unexpected,

00:17:58.336 --> 00:18:01.846 A:middle
and I can pick these flowers,
and they turn into ghosts,

and I can pick these flowers,
and they turn into ghosts,

which again begins
with the letter G.

of the nature of this app,

altogether.

Since November's launch,

00:19:00.826 --> 00:19:03.796 A:middle
their team of 30 has introduced
hundreds of thousands of people

00:19:03.876 --> 00:19:06.526 A:middle
to investing, with 25%
of their customers being

00:19:06.636 --> 00:19:07.526 A:middle
first-time investors.

00:19:17.926 --> 00:19:19.556 A:middle
&gt;&gt; SHAAN PRUDEN: Say good-bye
to commissions and hello

00:19:19.556 --> 00:19:20.586 A:middle
to the future of trading.

00:19:20.936 --> 00:19:23.186 A:middle
Robinhood lets you buy
and sell stocks for free.

00:19:23.666 --> 00:19:26.526 A:middle
It also gives you access to
market data and stock quotes

00:19:26.526 --> 00:19:28.046 A:middle
in real-time and allows you

00:19:28.046 --> 00:19:30.066 A:middle
to build a personalized
stock watch list

00:19:30.066 --> 00:19:31.236 A:middle
with smart notifications.

00:19:33.336 --> 00:19:33.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JOHN GELEYNSE: All right.

00:19:33.896 --> 00:19:34.506 A:middle
Let's take a look.

00:19:35.056 --> 00:19:37.646 A:middle
So Robinhood distinguishes
itself with this clean,

00:19:37.696 --> 00:19:40.576 A:middle
content-centric design,
beautiful typography,

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:42.696 A:middle
and a design that
really does a good job

00:19:42.806 --> 00:19:46.756 A:middle
at balancing app branding
with iOS design conventions.

00:19:47.286 --> 00:19:52.436 A:middle
So right out of the gate,
the app just draws you in.

00:19:52.436 --> 00:19:55.596 A:middle
The goal of the app is to
get more people to invest,

00:19:55.596 --> 00:19:59.446 A:middle
and right away, they decide
that there's no need to sign

00:19:59.446 --> 00:20:02.656 A:middle
up to actually do
things in the app.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.446 --> 00:20:02.656 A:middle
up to actually do
things in the app.

00:20:03.186 --> 00:20:04.016 A:middle
Let's see here.

00:20:04.566 --> 00:20:06.906 A:middle
Let me go to my backup.

00:20:16.436 --> 00:20:17.096 A:middle
There we go.

00:20:17.636 --> 00:20:20.786 A:middle
Because on the main screen,
if we simply scroll up,

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:23.336 A:middle
we get a bunch of stock
symbols, and these are

00:20:23.336 --> 00:20:25.486 A:middle
because the app is using
geolocation to come

00:20:25.486 --> 00:20:28.896 A:middle
up with these symbols based
on companies that are nearby.

00:20:29.446 --> 00:20:32.756 A:middle
So let's just tap into
Apple, and you can look

00:20:32.756 --> 00:20:35.576 A:middle
at Apple's performance
over the last little while.

00:20:35.576 --> 00:20:38.826 A:middle
You can tap on this chart and
see the stock performance.

00:20:39.006 --> 00:20:40.226 A:middle
I am not logged in yet.

00:20:40.226 --> 00:20:42.006 A:middle
I am not a customer of theirs.

00:20:42.006 --> 00:20:43.036 A:middle
I am not a member.

00:20:43.036 --> 00:20:44.416 A:middle
I am not -- you know, I
haven't done anything here.

00:20:44.416 --> 00:20:46.766 A:middle
I am just playing around with
this app, exploring with it.

00:20:46.766 --> 00:20:50.596 A:middle
I can just tap and drag on the
chart, get some great feedback

00:20:50.596 --> 00:20:51.766 A:middle
on the values at the top.

00:20:52.156 --> 00:20:55.356 A:middle
I can pinch and get a range
and get an average value.

00:20:55.776 --> 00:20:56.746 A:middle
So that's pretty cool.

00:20:56.926 --> 00:20:58.706 A:middle
I can look at stats
from the company.

00:20:59.116 --> 00:21:02.716 A:middle
I can swipe, do the
page effect to go back

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.116 --> 00:21:02.716 A:middle
I can swipe, do the
page effect to go back

00:21:02.806 --> 00:21:03.746 A:middle
to a different symbol.

00:21:04.236 --> 00:21:05.976 A:middle
Here I am at SPY; right?

00:21:06.246 --> 00:21:07.706 A:middle
I am looking through
all of this.

00:21:09.116 --> 00:21:10.556 A:middle
Right? So I can explore
all of these.

00:21:11.296 --> 00:21:12.496 A:middle
Let's go back to Apple.

00:21:12.496 --> 00:21:15.356 A:middle
And let's say that at this
point we are like yeah,

00:21:15.686 --> 00:21:18.186 A:middle
wonder what it would be like
to buy a stock in this app.

00:21:18.646 --> 00:21:21.856 A:middle
So we tap Buy, we decide
let's buy 25 shares

00:21:22.146 --> 00:21:25.966 A:middle
at the current market price
for a total of $3,195.

00:21:25.966 --> 00:21:26.906 A:middle
We say that's fine.

00:21:27.016 --> 00:21:31.306 A:middle
Review. Robinhood tells us
that this is a simulated trade,

00:21:31.586 --> 00:21:32.846 A:middle
but if we were doing a trade,

00:21:32.846 --> 00:21:34.306 A:middle
we could just swipe
up from the bottom.

00:21:34.796 --> 00:21:37.116 A:middle
The device vibrates,
I get some feedback,

00:21:37.366 --> 00:21:38.936 A:middle
and it says that's
what it would be

00:21:38.936 --> 00:21:41.286 A:middle
like to purchase some
stock in this application.

00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:44.666 A:middle
And at this point, I can
decide this is pretty cool

00:21:44.666 --> 00:21:47.306 A:middle
and I am going to sign
up and you quickly put

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:49.776 A:middle
in some basic information
about yourself,

00:21:49.776 --> 00:21:51.936 A:middle
you decide how you are going
to fund your transactions,

00:21:52.076 --> 00:21:53.896 A:middle
whether it's a checking
account, savings account,

00:21:54.316 --> 00:21:57.106 A:middle
and then you move on from
there and start investing.

00:21:57.536 --> 00:22:02.506 A:middle
And Robinhood uses Touch ID
for secure authentication,

such a great app.

00:22:08.956 --> 00:22:10.166 A:middle
We just love the design.

00:22:10.276 --> 00:22:13.986 A:middle
So simple, just draws you
in, and really well done.

00:22:14.046 --> 00:22:14.786 A:middle

00:23:07.876 --> 00:23:10.306 A:middle
Imagined by designers and
made exclusively for the Mac,

00:23:10.656 --> 00:23:13.616 A:middle
this fresh-faced, multifaceted

&gt;&gt; JOHN GELEYNSE: This app is
a seriously fast vector drawing

00:23:20.686 --> 00:23:22.576 A:middle
application for creative
professionals,

00:23:22.646 --> 00:23:25.076 A:middle
and there's no way that
I can show you, you know,

00:23:25.516 --> 00:23:27.446 A:middle
very many of the
features in this.

00:23:27.446 --> 00:23:30.176 A:middle
This is a full-featured
vector drawing app.

00:23:30.776 --> 00:23:33.086 A:middle
One of the cool things
that they've got in the --

00:23:33.086 --> 00:23:36.026 A:middle
just to get you oriented
is in the top-left corner

00:23:36.026 --> 00:23:37.866 A:middle
of the screen, there
are three icons,

00:23:37.866 --> 00:23:39.816 A:middle
and these represent
their personas,

00:23:40.296 --> 00:23:41.726 A:middle
basically modes for the app.

00:23:42.166 --> 00:23:43.616 A:middle
So here we have the
draw persona,

00:23:43.616 --> 00:23:46.606 A:middle
which gives us the tools
we need for vector drawing.

00:23:47.006 --> 00:23:49.806 A:middle
We can shift to the pixel
persona, which is the tools

00:23:49.806 --> 00:23:51.056 A:middle
for pixel-based editing.

00:23:51.306 --> 00:23:53.786 A:middle
Then we can move to the export
persona, which allows us

00:23:53.786 --> 00:23:56.326 A:middle
to export layers, groups,
objects, and regions.

00:23:56.896 --> 00:23:58.906 A:middle
Right? Let's go back
to the draw persona.

00:23:59.526 --> 00:24:01.906 A:middle
This app was written
from scratch on OS X

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.526 --> 00:24:01.906 A:middle
This app was written
from scratch on OS X

00:24:01.906 --> 00:24:05.656 A:middle
and takes advantage of Grand
Central Dispatch, OpenGL,

00:24:05.966 --> 00:24:09.496 A:middle
Core Graphics, and it's
fully optimized for 64 bit

00:24:09.496 --> 00:24:12.376 A:middle
and multicore, which
means it can do a ton

00:24:12.376 --> 00:24:13.886 A:middle
of stuff super fast.

00:24:14.396 --> 00:24:18.316 A:middle
So just scrolling around in
the document is super quick.

00:24:18.726 --> 00:24:23.206 A:middle
I can zoom in to up to a
million percent if I needed to.

00:24:23.536 --> 00:24:25.496 A:middle
As I scroll around at something

00:24:25.496 --> 00:24:28.326 A:middle
like 5,000 percent right
now, it's very quick.

00:24:28.906 --> 00:24:31.266 A:middle
They've got a great
feature where I can go

00:24:31.266 --> 00:24:32.486 A:middle
into these split views.

00:24:33.476 --> 00:24:34.246 A:middle
Just a second here.

00:24:35.096 --> 00:24:42.976 A:middle
Let's go into view mode
and go into split view,

00:24:43.256 --> 00:24:45.926 A:middle
which lets me split the
screen into two views,

00:24:45.926 --> 00:24:49.596 A:middle
and one of these views I can
actually go into outline view,

00:24:49.596 --> 00:24:52.596 A:middle
which means that in real-time,
I am getting my object --

00:24:53.116 --> 00:24:55.266 A:middle
I can see the full
rendered version or I can go

00:24:55.266 --> 00:24:59.976 A:middle
into outline view and select
individual objects [applause].

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:01.046 --> 00:25:03.516 A:middle
So then I can select them,
rotate them, grow them,

00:25:03.816 --> 00:25:07.136 A:middle
whatever I need to do,
and all of this is live.

00:25:07.196 --> 00:25:12.516 A:middle
So I could pick this object here
and grow it into this portion

00:25:12.516 --> 00:25:14.796 A:middle
of the screen, and you would see
the rendering effect right live

00:25:15.196 --> 00:25:17.196 A:middle
across the divide.

00:25:17.196 --> 00:25:19.106 A:middle
And I can just move this

00:25:19.106 --> 00:25:21.116 A:middle
in real-time back
and forth super fast.

00:25:21.696 --> 00:25:26.456 A:middle
Now, I was talking about
how you could do zoom,

00:25:26.646 --> 00:25:30.666 A:middle
and I remember seeing that there
was a spelling error up here,

00:25:30.666 --> 00:25:32.496 A:middle
so I am just going
to zoom in here

00:25:32.496 --> 00:25:34.366 A:middle
and fix something on my design.

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:36.366 A:middle
Now I am in at about
10,000 percent.

00:25:36.406 --> 00:25:41.726 A:middle
And I am just going to
change this one edit here,

00:25:42.146 --> 00:25:43.916 A:middle
and you know, move back out.

00:25:44.586 --> 00:25:46.666 A:middle
And you are looking
at this image here.

00:25:47.326 --> 00:25:50.606 A:middle
Right? So there's a
ton I could show you.

00:25:50.606 --> 00:25:52.416 A:middle
They've got a great corner tool,

00:25:52.686 --> 00:25:56.056 A:middle
they've got tremendous
functionality,

00:25:56.176 --> 00:26:00.216 A:middle

00:27:11.086 --> 00:27:13.286 A:middle
As you hop over endless
freeways, railroads,

00:27:13.286 --> 00:27:15.176 A:middle
and rivers you almost
don't mind getting run

00:27:15.176 --> 00:27:17.396 A:middle
over because the animations

00:27:17.396 --> 00:27:22.646 A:middle
for collisions are absolutely
hysterical, as you will see.

00:27:22.906 --> 00:27:23.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JOHN GELEYNSE: Great.

00:27:23.176 --> 00:27:27.406 A:middle
So Crossy Road -- let's go
to the iPad -- has this --

00:27:27.496 --> 00:27:29.436 A:middle
you know, it's got
this addictive balance

00:27:29.516 --> 00:27:33.936 A:middle
between a casual puzzle and
arcade game and, you know,

00:27:33.936 --> 00:27:36.326 A:middle
if you haven't played this game
you are missing out big time,

00:27:36.386 --> 00:27:39.086 A:middle
but if you have, you know
exactly what this is all about;

00:27:39.086 --> 00:27:39.246 A:middle
right?

00:27:39.246 --> 00:27:41.546 A:middle
You are this chicken
or some crazy character

00:27:41.546 --> 00:27:44.806 A:middle
that they've drawn, and you are
crossing these multilane roads.

00:27:45.286 --> 00:27:46.926 A:middle
Now, in this particular
case, I am not the chicken,

00:27:46.926 --> 00:27:48.126 A:middle
but let's move anyway.

00:27:48.836 --> 00:27:52.676 A:middle
I am tapping to move forward,
and I can move left and right.

00:27:55.166 --> 00:27:57.756 A:middle
This is the schoolgirl.

00:27:58.546 --> 00:27:59.996 A:middle

Oh, let's go, miss the
train, get out of the way.

00:28:03.826 --> 00:28:06.496 A:middle
Whoa. Let's keep going.

00:28:06.826 --> 00:28:10.896 A:middle
Oh, she got run over.

00:28:10.896 --> 00:28:11.676 A:middle
Okay. I am sorry.

00:28:11.676 --> 00:28:12.606 A:middle
Let's try another one.

00:28:12.606 --> 00:28:13.456 A:middle
Let's try the chicken,

00:28:13.526 --> 00:28:15.856 A:middle
see if the chicken comes
up, love the chicken.

00:28:15.886 --> 00:28:18.146 A:middle
So you have all these
characters that they've created,

00:28:18.146 --> 00:28:19.646 A:middle
and there's some
really good stuff.

00:28:19.646 --> 00:28:23.666 A:middle
Here's the dress,
you know, #thedress.

00:28:23.796 --> 00:28:27.466 A:middle
There is dark lord,
gravedigger, hot shot.

00:28:27.826 --> 00:28:29.426 A:middle
Let's go back to one
of my favorite ones.

00:28:29.426 --> 00:28:33.106 A:middle
I actually own chickens, just
the funniest creatures around,

00:28:33.556 --> 00:28:35.986 A:middle
so this is a real fun game
to play with your chicken.

00:28:36.826 --> 00:28:43.806 A:middle
So if you just look at the
8-bit isometric graphics,

00:28:43.856 --> 00:28:48.556 A:middle
just the sound.

00:28:48.556 --> 00:28:52.146 A:middle
Oh, and if that happens,
I can actually share this

00:28:52.226 --> 00:28:55.646 A:middle
with my friends and
look at the effect.

00:29:03.676 --> 00:29:05.226 A:middle
you could play this
forever; right?

00:29:05.226 --> 00:29:07.786 A:middle
And I know people who
get all the way up to 700

00:29:07.786 --> 00:29:09.466 A:middle
and it kills me because
the highest I can get is

00:29:09.466 --> 00:29:10.516 A:middle
about 70 or something.

00:29:10.886 --> 00:29:13.426 A:middle
But Crossy Road is such
exciting game play.

00:29:13.426 --> 00:29:16.206 A:middle
They have beautiful,
gorgeous 8-bit graphics,

00:29:16.836 --> 00:29:18.846 A:middle
if that even makes sense,
but there's just something

00:29:18.846 --> 00:29:21.756 A:middle
about the way you've designed
your characters, the artwork.

00:29:22.086 --> 00:29:25.576 A:middle
Hilarious collision animations,
expressive characters,

00:29:25.736 --> 00:29:28.256 A:middle
excellent sound design,
and you know what?

00:29:28.256 --> 00:29:32.186 A:middle
I think all of that combines to
create really great personality.

00:29:32.496 --> 00:29:34.796 A:middle
This game has got
tremendous personality,

00:29:35.146 --> 00:29:37.106 A:middle
which is really actually
a great characteristic

00:29:37.106 --> 00:29:37.966 A:middle
for an ADA winner.

00:29:38.046 --> 00:29:39.206 A:middle

Fantastical 2 launched
on the Mac App Store

00:30:20.196 --> 00:30:25.636 A:middle
in March of this year.

00:30:27.776 --> 00:30:29.196 A:middle
&gt;&gt; SHAAN PRUDEN:
Fantastical is a calendar app

00:30:29.196 --> 00:30:31.846 A:middle
that strikes the right balance
between features and usability.

00:30:32.316 --> 00:30:34.866 A:middle
With natural language creation
of events and reminders,

00:30:35.366 --> 00:30:41.196 A:middle
beautiful calendar views,
and ultra smart event lists.

00:30:41.356 --> 00:30:41.616 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JOHN GELEYNSE: Great.

00:30:41.616 --> 00:30:45.026 A:middle
So we picked Fantastical
for the beautiful

00:30:45.026 --> 00:30:47.126 A:middle
and thoughtfully designed
experience they brought

00:30:47.126 --> 00:30:48.246 A:middle
to OS X Yosemite.

00:30:48.446 --> 00:30:51.206 A:middle
I know that they've
worked really hard on this

00:30:51.706 --> 00:30:56.406 A:middle
because they have supported
prior to this iPad, iPhone,

00:30:56.616 --> 00:30:58.626 A:middle
most recently they just
came out with Apple Watch,

00:30:58.626 --> 00:31:02.706 A:middle
and they have done a great job
at bringing the visual style

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.626 --> 00:31:02.706 A:middle
and they have done a great job
at bringing the visual style

00:31:02.706 --> 00:31:05.246 A:middle
of the app across
all of those devices

00:31:05.246 --> 00:31:08.436 A:middle
and at delivering
something fantastic on OS X.

00:31:08.756 --> 00:31:11.116 A:middle
So I want to just show you a
couple of features in this app

00:31:11.206 --> 00:31:13.356 A:middle
that we think make
it really great.

00:31:13.756 --> 00:31:15.346 A:middle
First of all, it's super fast.

00:31:15.976 --> 00:31:18.066 A:middle
So if you just go to the
left side of the screen here,

00:31:18.296 --> 00:31:21.116 A:middle
you scroll through all
your stuff, the entire --

00:31:21.406 --> 00:31:22.906 A:middle
you know, everything
just follows along.

00:31:22.906 --> 00:31:25.566 A:middle
You look at the top-left corner,
it's whipping across the weeks

00:31:25.616 --> 00:31:27.106 A:middle
to indicate the ones
that are selected.

00:31:27.396 --> 00:31:30.006 A:middle
The right side is moving
through your full calendar.

00:31:30.006 --> 00:31:33.086 A:middle
And there's just not a
hesitation to the app.

00:31:33.306 --> 00:31:34.956 A:middle
That's fantastic.

00:31:35.386 --> 00:31:38.006 A:middle
We can examine what's
going on on a specific day.

00:31:38.006 --> 00:31:39.836 A:middle
If you look at the
top-left corner here,

00:31:39.836 --> 00:31:41.576 A:middle
you have dots below
some of these dates.

00:31:41.576 --> 00:31:44.086 A:middle
If I point on the
dates with dots,

00:31:44.446 --> 00:31:46.646 A:middle
and the dots are colored
according to my calendar colors,

00:31:46.976 --> 00:31:48.296 A:middle
I can see exactly what's going

00:31:48.296 --> 00:31:50.326 A:middle
on on those days
from which calendars.

00:31:50.636 --> 00:31:51.406 A:middle
That's pretty cool.

00:31:51.406 --> 00:31:53.576 A:middle
I don't have to collect and
examine and go into that day

00:31:53.576 --> 00:31:56.536 A:middle
and look at what's
happening at that point.

00:31:57.106 --> 00:32:00.636 A:middle
Fantastical 2 makes it super
easy to add new things,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:57.106 --> 00:32:00.636 A:middle
Fantastical 2 makes it super
easy to add new things,

00:32:01.046 --> 00:32:02.566 A:middle
new events or new reminders.

00:32:03.026 --> 00:32:04.676 A:middle
They support both
reminders and events.

00:32:05.036 --> 00:32:08.176 A:middle
So the way to add something
new is if you are in the app,

00:32:08.216 --> 00:32:11.966 A:middle
you tap this Add button, and now
you can use just simple English

00:32:12.016 --> 00:32:15.316 A:middle
language sentences, and they
have a natural language parser

00:32:15.596 --> 00:32:19.076 A:middle
that will just interpret
these and translate, you know,

00:32:19.076 --> 00:32:21.546 A:middle
and interpret those into
the actual event details.

00:32:21.756 --> 00:32:24.696 A:middle
And as I type, I want you
to watch the extra attention

00:32:24.696 --> 00:32:26.826 A:middle
to detail where, as it's
parsing, what I am doing,

00:32:26.826 --> 00:32:29.406 A:middle
it's going to be throwing
down dates and the times

00:32:29.406 --> 00:32:34.236 A:middle
into the spots in that field
in the form that appears.

00:32:34.696 --> 00:32:40.656 A:middle
So let's just do something
like meet with Ron tomorrow

00:32:41.686 --> 00:32:45.016 A:middle
at 6:00 p.m. for 30 minutes.

00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:46.006 A:middle
For example.

00:32:46.336 --> 00:32:48.106 A:middle
Boom. And there it is.

00:32:48.106 --> 00:32:49.376 A:middle
It knows what tomorrow means,

00:32:49.376 --> 00:32:51.116 A:middle
it knows what 30
minutes means, etcetera.

00:32:51.416 --> 00:32:53.726 A:middle
The app is localized
into nine languages,

00:32:53.976 --> 00:32:56.146 A:middle
and the natural language
parser works

00:32:56.146 --> 00:32:57.626 A:middle
in those nine languages as well.

00:32:57.856 --> 00:33:00.656 A:middle
So this is a really great
experience across the world

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:57.856 --> 00:33:00.656 A:middle
So this is a really great
experience across the world

00:33:00.656 --> 00:33:03.976 A:middle
for people in many,
many countries.

00:33:04.626 --> 00:33:06.316 A:middle
You can also add events.

00:33:06.316 --> 00:33:08.646 A:middle
If you were in another
application, you could just go

00:33:08.646 --> 00:33:12.136 A:middle
up to the menu extra and
just add stuff up here,

00:33:12.136 --> 00:33:13.636 A:middle
so I could do something else,

00:33:13.636 --> 00:33:22.126 A:middle
like pick up sushi next
Tuesday at 7:00 p.m. Boom.

00:33:22.126 --> 00:33:23.356 A:middle
And it throws the date in there,

00:33:23.356 --> 00:33:24.736 A:middle
puts it on my calendar,
and it's gone.

00:33:25.016 --> 00:33:27.046 A:middle
This little guy can
be torn off --

00:33:27.046 --> 00:33:29.766 A:middle
I wouldn't do this with the main
app running, but for the demo,

00:33:29.766 --> 00:33:32.296 A:middle
let me tear this off, and you
can have a Mini Window there

00:33:32.506 --> 00:33:35.506 A:middle
that's really handy to have
sticking around onscreen.

00:33:36.236 --> 00:33:39.836 A:middle
The other thing that they
do is that they've got --

00:33:39.836 --> 00:33:42.126 A:middle
Fantastical has got
multiple calendar sets,

00:33:42.566 --> 00:33:46.086 A:middle
and you can create work sets,
home sets, vacation sets,

00:33:46.086 --> 00:33:47.736 A:middle
whatever sets of
calendars you want,

00:33:47.866 --> 00:33:52.246 A:middle
and these calendars can have
multiple calendars within them,

00:33:52.356 --> 00:33:55.716 A:middle
and each set of calendars
can be activated at any time.

00:33:55.846 --> 00:33:59.166 A:middle
And not only that, you can go
in and say I want this calendar

00:33:59.166 --> 00:34:02.116 A:middle
to be activated on my
arrival at this location.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

to be activated on my
arrival at this location.

00:34:02.416 --> 00:34:04.336 A:middle
So I get to work, boom,
my calendar enables.

00:34:04.886 --> 00:34:08.346 A:middle
Or I get home, or I leave home
and some other calendar enables.

00:34:08.815 --> 00:34:09.396 A:middle
Very cool.

00:34:10.536 --> 00:34:13.406 A:middle
So you can see that here when
you go into Manage Calendars,

00:34:13.735 --> 00:34:16.186 A:middle
you can go through, pick the
different ones you've got,

00:34:16.186 --> 00:34:17.746 A:middle
and you can automatically
activate

00:34:17.746 --> 00:34:20.996 A:middle
on a location that
you might want.

00:34:21.226 --> 00:34:24.266 A:middle
Fantastical does a
great job of toggling

00:34:24.266 --> 00:34:29.275 A:middle
between these calendars, and it
also supports a Today widget.

00:34:29.275 --> 00:34:32.815 A:middle
They have Share and
Action extensions.

00:34:32.815 --> 00:34:34.606 A:middle
They support geolocation.

00:34:34.896 --> 00:34:38.626 A:middle
They are deeply integrated
with OS X Yosemite,

00:34:38.626 --> 00:34:41.255 A:middle
and I just think it's a
tremendous productivity app.

00:34:41.666 --> 00:34:44.775 A:middle
You guys have done a fantastic
job and I think set the standard

00:34:45.076 --> 00:34:47.416 A:middle

00:34:47.416 --> 00:34:47.835 A:middle
be like.

00:35:26.666 --> 00:35:29.306 A:middle
Workflow is a result of a

00:35:29.346 --> 00:35:39.236 A:middle
into high gear after
attending last year's WWDC.

automate the things you do

Workflow was selected

00:35:55.266 --> 00:35:58.856 A:middle
as an Apple Design Award winner
because of its extensive use

of the iOS accessibility API,

of the iOS accessibility API,

00:36:02.806 --> 00:36:06.386 A:middle
and just like a moment ago
I said Fantastical set the

00:36:06.386 --> 00:36:09.606 A:middle
standard for what productivity
apps on the Mac should be like,

00:36:10.176 --> 00:36:13.136 A:middle
Workflow sets the standard
for what accessibility --

00:36:13.346 --> 00:36:16.816 A:middle
what apps should be doing in
terms of adopting accessibility,

00:36:17.106 --> 00:36:19.966 A:middle
to enable these apps
to be used by people

00:36:19.966 --> 00:36:21.476 A:middle
with vision impairment.

00:36:22.026 --> 00:36:25.266 A:middle
And I could do this
demo, but honestly,

00:36:25.266 --> 00:36:29.036 A:middle
it's far more impactful if
it is done by a colleague --

00:36:29.036 --> 00:36:30.166 A:middle
a few colleagues of mine

00:36:30.166 --> 00:36:32.466 A:middle
from the iOS accessibility
engineering team

00:36:32.776 --> 00:36:34.686 A:middle
who can really show you
how this thing is used.

00:36:34.896 --> 00:36:37.496 A:middle
So I would like to invite
Ryan and Dean on stage.

and we're really excited
about the accessibility.

and we're really excited
about the accessibility.

00:37:01.376 --> 00:37:05.966 A:middle
It's just amazing work that
the Workflow team has done

00:37:06.406 --> 00:37:08.426 A:middle
in the Workflow app.

00:37:10.456 --> 00:37:13.406 A:middle
Apple is very deeply
committed to accessibility.

00:37:14.276 --> 00:37:20.406 A:middle
We have accessibility in all our
products, including iOS, OS X,

00:37:20.406 --> 00:37:22.756 A:middle
and now even the Watch.

00:37:23.876 --> 00:37:26.496 A:middle
But you know, today I want to
talk about VoiceOver in iOS.

00:37:27.506 --> 00:37:28.356 A:middle
Now, if you don't know,

00:37:28.356 --> 00:37:30.906 A:middle
VoiceOver is a built-in
screen reader

00:37:31.336 --> 00:37:33.806 A:middle
that allows visually
impaired users

00:37:34.026 --> 00:37:37.086 A:middle
to access iOS and your apps.

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:43.476 A:middle
So you may be asking yourself,
well, how do I use VoiceOver?

00:37:43.476 --> 00:37:43.846 A:middle
What's that?

00:37:44.016 --> 00:37:46.986 A:middle
I mean -- to use
VoiceOver, you really need

00:37:46.986 --> 00:37:48.086 A:middle
to know three gestures --

00:37:48.706 --> 00:37:52.416 A:middle
touch, swipe, and
double-tap to activate.

00:37:52.666 --> 00:37:55.226 A:middle
In a moment, I am going to
have Ryan demo those gestures.

00:37:55.226 --> 00:37:57.706 A:middle
Let's talk about
touch, touch to explore.

00:37:58.386 --> 00:38:01.466 A:middle
It's a way for visually
impaired users

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:58.386 --> 00:38:01.466 A:middle
It's a way for visually
impaired users

00:38:01.466 --> 00:38:06.616 A:middle
to safely navigate your apps in
iOS without activating anything.

00:38:07.576 --> 00:38:08.936 A:middle
And so they can get
the layout of the app.

00:38:10.166 --> 00:38:11.746 A:middle
And to demonstrate that,
I am going to ask Ryan

00:38:11.746 --> 00:38:13.276 A:middle
to show you touch to explore.

00:38:16.236 --> 00:38:17.566 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Game Center.

00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:19.326 A:middle
Double-tap to open.

00:38:20.386 --> 00:38:22.246 A:middle
&gt;&gt; DEAN HUDSON: The second
gesture we have is swipe

00:38:22.366 --> 00:38:27.606 A:middle
to navigate, and this allows a
user to swipe through buttons,

00:38:27.606 --> 00:38:30.966 A:middle
UI elements within your
application sequentially,

00:38:31.226 --> 00:38:33.776 A:middle
either forwards or backwards,
with a single finger swipe.

00:38:34.206 --> 00:38:34.496 A:middle
Ryan?

00:38:35.666 --> 00:38:36.126 A:middle

folder to Workflow.

00:38:40.936 --> 00:38:41.866 A:middle
Double-tap to open.

00:38:42.746 --> 00:38:44.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; DEAN HUDSON: Now, the third
gesture we have is double-tap.

00:38:45.806 --> 00:38:47.756 A:middle
Now, remember, with
VoiceOver on,

00:38:48.016 --> 00:38:49.546 A:middle
touching is not going
to activate the item.

00:38:50.706 --> 00:38:52.676 A:middle
You have to use a double-tap.

00:38:52.976 --> 00:38:55.026 A:middle
What's interesting about
this gesture, though,

00:38:55.416 --> 00:38:58.156 A:middle
is you can have VoiceOver
focused on an element

00:38:58.686 --> 00:39:01.746 A:middle
and double-tap anywhere
else on the screen.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:58.686 --> 00:39:01.746 A:middle
and double-tap anywhere
else on the screen.

00:39:02.246 --> 00:39:03.226 A:middle
And that's very unique.

00:39:03.606 --> 00:39:06.996 A:middle
It's very crucial for VoiceOver
users because it's hard to find

00:39:06.996 --> 00:39:09.096 A:middle
that focus area again.

00:39:10.666 --> 00:39:11.366 A:middle
And Ryan?

Turns on Workflow editing mode.

00:39:19.016 --> 00:39:21.266 A:middle
&gt;&gt; DEAN HUDSON: So that's
VoiceOver, it's awesome, great,

00:39:21.556 --> 00:39:25.156 A:middle
we love it, we use it, but it's
really only half the story;

00:39:25.416 --> 00:39:25.696 A:middle
right?

00:39:26.776 --> 00:39:30.056 A:middle
You know, the other half is
what you, as a developer,

00:39:30.586 --> 00:39:32.386 A:middle
does in your apps to
make it accessible.

00:39:32.896 --> 00:39:35.436 A:middle
And it's using VoiceOver
together with accessibility

00:39:35.436 --> 00:39:37.196 A:middle
that makes a great
user experience.

00:39:37.686 --> 00:39:40.996 A:middle
Right now I am going to have
Ryan show the Workflow app

00:39:40.996 --> 00:39:42.786 A:middle
with accessibility
using VoiceOver.

00:39:44.056 --> 00:39:46.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; RYAN DOUR: So as Dean
said, my name is Ryan Dour,

00:39:46.056 --> 00:39:46.936 A:middle
and I am going to take you

00:39:46.936 --> 00:39:48.546 A:middle
through Workflow
using VoiceOver.

00:39:48.876 --> 00:39:52.176 A:middle
First I am going to go ahead
and start creating a Workflow.

00:39:52.176 --> 00:39:54.826 A:middle
You'll notice that
it's a visual button,

00:39:54.826 --> 00:39:56.396 A:middle
for me it's going
to speak a label.

00:39:56.396 --> 00:39:58.366 A:middle

I want to do here, actually,

00:40:13.656 --> 00:40:17.226 A:middle
I would like to get my current
location, then I think I want

00:40:17.226 --> 00:40:20.786 A:middle
to turn it into a URL so I
can share it with friends.

00:40:20.846 --> 00:40:23.256 A:middle
Finally, I think I'll copy
to my clipboard, actually,

00:40:23.256 --> 00:40:25.116 A:middle
so that it's easy to use
in a bunch of places.

00:40:25.886 --> 00:40:26.936 A:middle
Let's go ahead and start.

00:40:26.936 --> 00:40:29.676 A:middle
I am going to touch
the thing I am looking

00:40:29.676 --> 00:40:30.816 A:middle
for on the left side here.

00:40:30.816 --> 00:40:32.066 A:middle

this sidebar.

Their original intention was

to make Does Not
Commute a quick minigame,

00:43:38.736 --> 00:43:40.166 A:middle
but as they progressed,
the game grew

00:43:40.276 --> 00:43:42.096 A:middle

but as you drive -- as you try
to complete the challenges,

you are driving these
different vehicles,

00:44:25.016 --> 00:44:27.936 A:middle
and every time you drive
one and maybe, you know,

00:44:28.116 --> 00:44:30.846 A:middle
veer off the road or whatever,
make a mistake or screw

00:44:30.846 --> 00:44:34.846 A:middle
up somehow, it's going to
get you in the next level.

well, you are great.

If you screw up, you get caught,
and it comes back to haunt you

for you if you have not

What you are doing is you've
got to follow this arrow,

to drive 13 commuters

you can just go pick that up.

get a little scary

cream would melt.

pretty good, actually, today,

here -- or not -- you know.

if we could just get the volume

up a little bit on this,
this is pretty good

I have to say this is the
demo I've been looking forward

00:50:46.396 --> 00:50:47.066 A:middle
to the most.

00:50:57.726 --> 00:51:01.186 A:middle
After the launch of Pacemaker
for iPad in early 2014,

00:51:01.486 --> 00:51:03.186 A:middle
the team soon realized
that their users,

00:51:03.186 --> 00:51:05.676 A:middle
predominantly college
students, wanted to participate

00:51:05.676 --> 00:51:08.306 A:middle
in the party rather than being
stuck with DJing the music.

00:51:08.676 --> 00:51:10.786 A:middle
To solve this, the
Pacemaker team decided

00:51:10.786 --> 00:51:19.276 A:middle
to develop an AI DJ, which
launched in December 2014.

00:51:22.366 --> 00:51:23.936 A:middle

provides a full range

00:51:23.936 --> 00:51:25.836 A:middle

mixing on iPhone and Apple Watch

&gt;&gt; JOHN GELEYNSE:
Let's take a look.

00:51:36.166 --> 00:51:39.426 A:middle
This app is set up to
give you the experience

00:51:39.426 --> 00:51:43.366 A:middle
of really making DJ fun and
personal with your music.

00:51:43.656 --> 00:51:45.786 A:middle
This isn't about
running a concert

00:51:45.786 --> 00:51:47.726 A:middle
for 70,000 fans necessarily.

00:51:47.726 --> 00:51:51.256 A:middle
It's more about just, you know,
creating a beat and a groove

00:51:51.256 --> 00:51:54.186 A:middle
at home maybe with some
friends at a party.

00:51:54.186 --> 00:51:58.466 A:middle
So I am going to launch the
app and pick some songs here,

00:51:58.826 --> 00:52:00.946 A:middle
and let's pick this one.

00:52:01.416 --> 00:52:02.126 A:middle
Play that.

00:52:02.126 --> 00:52:04.266 A:middle

That sounds kind of lame.

00:52:14.326 --> 00:52:15.266 A:middle
There is something wrong here.

00:52:15.266 --> 00:52:18.596 A:middle

00:52:25.436 --> 00:52:26.256 A:middle
There. All right.

00:52:26.866 --> 00:52:27.416 A:middle
That's better.

00:52:27.876 --> 00:52:30.166 A:middle
Okay. So let's add
another track here.

00:52:30.166 --> 00:52:34.796 A:middle
Let's try this one,
Mogadishu, and let's move on

00:52:34.796 --> 00:52:36.736 A:middle
and add another track here.

00:52:36.926 --> 00:52:37.506 A:middle
All right.

00:52:37.506 --> 00:52:38.896 A:middle
So this is on iPhone; right?

00:52:38.896 --> 00:52:41.846 A:middle
And I can start a
track playing [music].

00:52:44.046 --> 00:52:45.336 A:middle
Let's skip to the next one.

00:52:45.586 --> 00:52:49.146 A:middle
And it's going to
automatically merge the two

00:52:49.146 --> 00:52:52.076 A:middle
of these tracks together
pretty quickly.

00:52:52.076 --> 00:52:52.416 A:middle
All right.

00:52:52.576 --> 00:52:55.776 A:middle
So we are in Mogadishu here,
and we can turn on the effects.

00:52:56.276 --> 00:52:59.796 A:middle
Right on iPhone, we can start
doing some cool effects.

Okay. I can do a high-low.

00:53:13.046 --> 00:53:14.646 A:middle
I can do an 8-bit.

00:53:18.046 --> 00:53:19.056 A:middle
Right. Let's move
to the next song.

00:53:19.056 --> 00:53:21.446 A:middle
It's going to do this
autopilot mixing.

00:53:21.636 --> 00:53:24.136 A:middle
So you just say move
on to the next song.

00:53:24.136 --> 00:53:25.766 A:middle
It's got this animation
coming in.

00:53:25.986 --> 00:53:28.976 A:middle
It's going to analyze the
beats, and then it's going

00:53:28.976 --> 00:53:31.566 A:middle
to merge these two songs
together really nicely.

00:53:34.126 --> 00:53:41.146 A:middle
Well, I sped that
up a little bit.

00:53:41.316 --> 00:53:45.486 A:middle
Sorry. Right, so you see the
effect that we've got here.

00:53:45.486 --> 00:53:50.826 A:middle
Right? So I can do some
white noise in the app.

00:53:50.826 --> 00:53:53.036 A:middle
Then you've got that
happening on the iPhone.

00:53:53.296 --> 00:53:55.406 A:middle
But they actually added
Apple Watch support,

00:53:55.716 --> 00:54:00.386 A:middle
so you can take your iPhone,
stick it in the stereo at home,

and now pick up your watch, go
dancing with your friends --

00:54:05.006 --> 00:54:06.776 A:middle
let's switch to the Watch here.

Let's launch Pacemaker
on the Watch.

00:54:09.846 --> 00:54:17.056 A:middle
We can add these effects.

00:54:17.846 --> 00:54:20.526 A:middle
And it knows exactly
which track is playing,

00:54:21.096 --> 00:54:22.546 A:middle
and so we can add
some white noise.

00:54:23.116 --> 00:54:25.996 A:middle
We can stop it.

00:54:27.456 --> 00:54:30.606 A:middle
We can add the chop.

00:54:31.406 --> 00:54:34.086 A:middle
And you notice see the feedback
going right on the watch?

00:54:34.496 --> 00:54:37.846 A:middle
It's all timed with the music
that's playing right now.

00:54:39.786 --> 00:54:40.976 A:middle
I can add the 8-bit effect.

00:54:48.046 --> 00:54:49.836 A:middle
I didn't say I was a DJ, but
you know, you get the point.

00:54:50.306 --> 00:54:54.806 A:middle
And I can apply the low filter
effect, and it will dip.

going on on the watch.
