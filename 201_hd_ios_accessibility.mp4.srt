00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:23.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: Good morning, and
welcome to Accessibility on iOS,

00:00:23.386 --> 00:00:25.626 A:middle
my name is Ian Fisch
and I'm an engineer

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:27.056 A:middle
on the Accessibility team.

00:00:28.576 --> 00:00:31.866 A:middle
So accessibility is really
about making sure all users,

00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:34.916 A:middle
regardless of abilities,
have full access to all

00:00:34.916 --> 00:00:37.516 A:middle
of our products and the great
features you put in your apps,

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:40.726 A:middle
and that means we get to
focus on users and think

00:00:40.726 --> 00:00:43.686 A:middle
about how users with these
different abilities use

00:00:43.686 --> 00:00:44.296 A:middle
our features.

00:00:44.846 --> 00:00:47.636 A:middle
That, in turn, has allowed
Apple to create great futures

00:00:47.946 --> 00:00:51.336 A:middle
to empower users, like
the girl you see here

00:00:51.336 --> 00:00:55.106 A:middle
with a switch mounted next
to her head which allows her

00:00:55.106 --> 00:00:57.646 A:middle
to control all of iOS,
with just that one button.

00:00:57.646 --> 00:01:01.016 A:middle
And that gives her the
freedom to communicate and play

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:57.646 --> 00:01:01.016 A:middle
And that gives her the
freedom to communicate and play

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:02.756 A:middle
without the need for assistance.

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:07.366 A:middle
And as users get older
and older, more and more

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.696 A:middle
of them will be using these
accessibility features,

00:01:09.696 --> 00:01:12.116 A:middle
so the time is really
now to start thinking

00:01:12.116 --> 00:01:15.306 A:middle
about accessibility in
the terms of your app.

00:01:16.336 --> 00:01:19.806 A:middle
So Apple creates these great
accessibility features,

00:01:19.806 --> 00:01:21.376 A:middle
but that's only part
of the story.

00:01:21.696 --> 00:01:24.016 A:middle
We need all of your
apps to be accessible

00:01:24.396 --> 00:01:27.146 A:middle
so we can create a great
ecosystem for accessibility

00:01:27.146 --> 00:01:28.426 A:middle
and empower these users.

00:01:29.886 --> 00:01:32.276 A:middle
Today we will be talking about
the accessibility futures

00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:33.906 A:middle
that Apple provides on iOS.

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:39.416 A:middle
We will look at what's new
in iOS ,9 and we will go

00:01:39.416 --> 00:01:41.166 A:middle
through what we call
an accessibility audit,

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:42.536 A:middle
where we will look at an app

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:44.376 A:middle
and see how accessible
it is already.

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:48.236 A:middle
Then we will go through
implementing some accessibility

00:01:48.646 --> 00:01:49.226 A:middle
in that app.

00:01:50.596 --> 00:01:52.476 A:middle
But first, let's take a look

00:01:52.476 --> 00:01:55.376 A:middle
at the accessibility
features that Apple provides.

00:01:56.136 --> 00:02:00.516 A:middle
We break those into four large
areas: hearing, learning,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:56.136 --> 00:02:00.516 A:middle
We break those into four large
areas: hearing, learning,

00:02:01.386 --> 00:02:03.626 A:middle
vision, and physical and motor.

00:02:04.126 --> 00:02:06.676 A:middle
So I will go through just a few
of the features that we have,

00:02:06.676 --> 00:02:10.985 A:middle
but there are many more I don't
have time to talk about today.

00:02:11.156 --> 00:02:13.926 A:middle
For hearing, we have
made-for-iPhone hearing aids,

00:02:14.306 --> 00:02:17.296 A:middle
which allow users to stream
high-quality audio directly

00:02:17.296 --> 00:02:19.756 A:middle
from their iOS device
and control the settings

00:02:19.756 --> 00:02:20.596 A:middle
of those hearing aids.

00:02:21.146 --> 00:02:24.516 A:middle
This replaces a lot of extra
hardware the user would have

00:02:24.516 --> 00:02:25.716 A:middle
to carry with them
all of the time

00:02:26.086 --> 00:02:30.486 A:middle
and provides a much more private
experience for setting these

00:02:30.926 --> 00:02:32.246 A:middle
or changing the settings
for hearing aids.

00:02:33.756 --> 00:02:37.336 A:middle
For learning, we have guided
access, which lets teachers,

00:02:37.376 --> 00:02:41.506 A:middle
parents, and caregivers remove
distractions so users can focus

00:02:41.506 --> 00:02:42.966 A:middle
on a specific app or task.

00:02:43.956 --> 00:02:46.476 A:middle
And we even provide time limits

00:02:46.676 --> 00:02:49.656 A:middle
so you can restrict the
time allowed in a task.

00:02:50.076 --> 00:02:54.056 A:middle
For developers, we provide
an API that allows you

00:02:54.056 --> 00:02:57.506 A:middle
to provide specific
restrictions for your app.

00:02:58.876 --> 00:03:03.316 A:middle
For vision, we have
VoiceOver, which lets blind

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:58.876 --> 00:03:03.316 A:middle
For vision, we have
VoiceOver, which lets blind

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:05.306 A:middle
and low-vision users
touch the screen

00:03:05.306 --> 00:03:07.346 A:middle
and have VoiceOver read
what's under their finger.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:11.036 A:middle
So they can use gestures
to interact

00:03:11.036 --> 00:03:14.356 A:middle
with the touchscreen even though
they can't see the screen.

00:03:16.116 --> 00:03:19.966 A:middle
We also have Zoom, which lets
users who may need things

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:21.186 A:middle
to be just a little bit bigger

00:03:21.186 --> 00:03:25.206 A:middle
but can see the screen magnify
the interface of your app

00:03:25.426 --> 00:03:27.476 A:middle
and the operating system.

00:03:27.936 --> 00:03:31.066 A:middle
And it will even
follow text as you type

00:03:31.066 --> 00:03:32.686 A:middle
and leave the keyboard unzoomed

00:03:33.216 --> 00:03:35.476 A:middle
so you can still have full
access to the keyboard.

00:03:35.906 --> 00:03:38.106 A:middle
Finally for vision, we
have Vision Accommodations,

00:03:38.496 --> 00:03:40.086 A:middle
which adjusts the
interface for users

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:42.966 A:middle
who might need larger
text, higher contrast,

00:03:43.386 --> 00:03:46.586 A:middle
or reduced motion so users can
more easily orient themselves

00:03:46.586 --> 00:03:47.486 A:middle
with what's on screen.

00:03:49.236 --> 00:03:51.686 A:middle
For physical and motor,
we have Switch Control,

00:03:51.686 --> 00:03:54.356 A:middle
which uses these
switches, or large buttons,

00:03:54.806 --> 00:03:56.346 A:middle
to control the operating system.

00:03:56.476 --> 00:03:59.296 A:middle
It's great for users who may
not be able to fully interact

00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:01.626 A:middle
with the touchscreen,
and it allows them

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:01.626 A:middle
with the touchscreen,
and it allows them

00:04:01.626 --> 00:04:04.076 A:middle
to sequentially navigate
the items on screen

00:04:04.426 --> 00:04:07.386 A:middle
and perform complex
gestures and even play games.

00:04:08.216 --> 00:04:14.296 A:middle
If a user has difficulty
performing gestures

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:16.326 A:middle
or pressing a physical
button, we have AssistiveTouch,

00:04:16.416 --> 00:04:19.375 A:middle
which provides a menu to
quickly access recorded gestures

00:04:19.935 --> 00:04:21.065 A:middle
and hardware buttons.

00:04:21.065 --> 00:04:21.726 A:middle
And this even works

00:04:21.726 --> 00:04:24.376 A:middle
with third-party assistive
devices like wheelchairs.

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:29.256 A:middle
And brand new in iOS 9 we
have Touch Accommodations,

00:04:29.646 --> 00:04:32.196 A:middle
which helps users who may have
difficulty performing precise

00:04:32.196 --> 00:04:35.766 A:middle
gestures by changing the way the
touchscreen responds to touches,

00:04:36.866 --> 00:04:38.766 A:middle
and I would love to give
you a demo of that now.

00:04:40.336 --> 00:04:42.386 A:middle
Like all accessibility
features, you can turn

00:04:42.386 --> 00:04:45.086 A:middle
on Touch Accommodations by
going to Settings, General,

00:04:45.556 --> 00:04:48.506 A:middle
Accessibility, and you
can see the large list

00:04:48.506 --> 00:04:50.106 A:middle
of accessibility
features we provide.

00:04:50.636 --> 00:04:53.296 A:middle
But for now, we will go
into Touch Accommodations.

00:04:54.026 --> 00:04:55.416 A:middle
And you see we have
got three options.

00:04:56.006 --> 00:04:57.366 A:middle
Let's look at Hold Duration.

00:04:58.196 --> 00:05:02.936 A:middle
And this allows people
who may have tremors

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:58.196 --> 00:05:02.936 A:middle
And this allows people
who may have tremors

00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:06.526 A:middle
and touch the screen more than
they would like to set a timeout

00:05:06.846 --> 00:05:11.126 A:middle
so not all touches are used.

00:05:11.126 --> 00:05:14.536 A:middle
So let's turn on Hold Duration
and Touch Accommodations.

00:05:14.786 --> 00:05:17.106 A:middle
So I go back to the Home
button, you will notice

00:05:17.106 --> 00:05:20.486 A:middle
when I put my finger on the
screen I get this timer icon,

00:05:20.536 --> 00:05:23.116 A:middle
and if I lift up
before the time is up,

00:05:23.646 --> 00:05:25.266 A:middle
the touch isn't passed
to the icon.

00:05:25.646 --> 00:05:28.456 A:middle
But if I tap and hold
for the whole duration,

00:05:29.866 --> 00:05:33.076 A:middle
it will open the app.

00:05:33.196 --> 00:05:37.536 A:middle
So if I have tremors, they
won't be respected as touches.

00:05:38.376 --> 00:05:41.586 A:middle
Great! So if we go
back into Settings,

00:05:42.356 --> 00:05:48.406 A:middle
we can look at Tap Assistance,
which is great for users

00:05:48.406 --> 00:05:52.446 A:middle
who may not be able to land
on exactly the right icon

00:05:52.446 --> 00:05:53.456 A:middle
that they are looking for.

00:05:54.146 --> 00:05:56.256 A:middle
So if we go back
to the Home screen,

00:05:57.236 --> 00:06:02.306 A:middle
you can see that if I press on
Clock and then move to Calendar,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:57.236 --> 00:06:02.306 A:middle
you can see that if I press on
Clock and then move to Calendar,

00:06:02.926 --> 00:06:05.956 A:middle
the touch will be passed to
Calendar instead of Clock.

00:06:06.446 --> 00:06:09.966 A:middle
So it's the final touch
location that's respected.

00:06:10.576 --> 00:06:18.256 A:middle
And that's Touch
Accommodations on iOS 9.

00:06:18.516 --> 00:06:22.256 A:middle
So, many of these accessibility
features rely on UIAccessibility

00:06:22.486 --> 00:06:25.196 A:middle
to bridge the gap between
the assistive technology

00:06:25.346 --> 00:06:26.246 A:middle
and your app.

00:06:26.916 --> 00:06:30.646 A:middle
For instance, if a VoiceOver
user taps on the screen,

00:06:31.076 --> 00:06:33.256 A:middle
it will look for the
element under their finger

00:06:33.836 --> 00:06:36.706 A:middle
and ask the element in your app
for its accessibility label.

00:06:37.276 --> 00:06:40.736 A:middle
So when you return the string
Weather, VoiceOver will speak:

00:06:40.936 --> 00:06:41.836 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Weather.

00:06:42.696 --> 00:06:46.036 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: And similarly
with Switch Control,

00:06:46.036 --> 00:06:49.536 A:middle
the Switch Control user
brings up the menu on one

00:06:49.536 --> 00:06:51.406 A:middle
of your elements,
will ask that element

00:06:51.466 --> 00:06:53.626 A:middle
for its accessibility
custom actions,

00:06:54.246 --> 00:06:56.836 A:middle
and when you return the
actions -- move, pass and trade,

00:06:56.996 --> 00:06:57.916 A:middle
if it's a game app, maybe --

00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:00.246 A:middle
it will display those in
the Switch Control menu

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:00.246 A:middle
it will display those in
the Switch Control menu

00:07:00.656 --> 00:07:03.766 A:middle
so users have fast
access to these actions

00:07:04.166 --> 00:07:05.256 A:middle
on elements in your app.

00:07:06.096 --> 00:07:09.586 A:middle
So you will notice that
UIAccessibility is really

00:07:09.586 --> 00:07:11.916 A:middle
about asking questions
of elements in your app

00:07:12.316 --> 00:07:15.226 A:middle
so the assistive technology
knows how to work with it.

00:07:16.236 --> 00:07:17.616 A:middle
So let's go through a
few of those questions.

00:07:18.286 --> 00:07:19.936 A:middle
The first one is: Do
I serve a purpose?

00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:24.336 A:middle
This is really about
whether an element is useful

00:07:24.336 --> 00:07:25.656 A:middle
or important to the user.

00:07:25.936 --> 00:07:28.196 A:middle
So a line that separates
elements

00:07:28.196 --> 00:07:29.806 A:middle
in a view is very
important visually,

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:31.846 A:middle
but since the user
can't interact with it

00:07:31.846 --> 00:07:34.736 A:middle
and it doesn't provide
information like a UI label,

00:07:35.176 --> 00:07:36.726 A:middle
it's not really serving
a purpose.

00:07:37.926 --> 00:07:40.916 A:middle
So we answer this question
with Is Accessibility Element.

00:07:41.566 --> 00:07:45.496 A:middle
If we look at the Plus button
in Clock, it's a button,

00:07:45.496 --> 00:07:46.946 A:middle
the user can interact with it,

00:07:46.946 --> 00:07:48.986 A:middle
and so for that we
would return True.

00:07:49.536 --> 00:07:53.526 A:middle
The next most important
question is: What's my name?

00:07:53.986 --> 00:07:56.146 A:middle
We answer that with
Accessibility Label.

00:07:56.246 --> 00:07:58.976 A:middle
This is what VoiceOver
uses to read

00:07:58.976 --> 00:08:00.606 A:middle
to the user what's
under their finger.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.976 --> 00:08:00.606 A:middle
to the user what's
under their finger.

00:08:01.386 --> 00:08:05.586 A:middle
If we look at the Plus
button, you might be tempted

00:08:05.586 --> 00:08:08.386 A:middle
to set the label to something
like Button To Add A Clock,

00:08:09.026 --> 00:08:12.216 A:middle
which is a great description
of what the button will do,

00:08:12.216 --> 00:08:14.726 A:middle
but you should think of the
accessibility label more

00:08:14.726 --> 00:08:16.626 A:middle
like the title of a button,

00:08:16.626 --> 00:08:20.366 A:middle
so a better accessibility
label would just be Add.

00:08:21.276 --> 00:08:25.986 A:middle
So what's the personality
of the element in your app?

00:08:25.986 --> 00:08:29.566 A:middle
And this is really about
describing to the user

00:08:29.706 --> 00:08:32.696 A:middle
and the assistive technology
how they can interact

00:08:32.696 --> 00:08:33.275 A:middle
with an element.

00:08:33.645 --> 00:08:35.696 A:middle
So we answer that with
Accessibility Traits.

00:08:35.946 --> 00:08:38.905 A:middle
So we have a whole host
of traits that you can set

00:08:38.905 --> 00:08:42.056 A:middle
on elements that describe
how to interact with them.

00:08:42.546 --> 00:08:46.076 A:middle
So if we look at the Plus
or Add button in Clock,

00:08:46.576 --> 00:08:49.476 A:middle
we would set the trait to
Button, because it's a button,

00:08:49.476 --> 00:08:52.026 A:middle
and VoiceOver would read
it as a button to the user.

00:08:52.536 --> 00:08:56.306 A:middle
Next question is:
What's my value?

00:08:56.716 --> 00:08:59.666 A:middle
So if an element has a state
that changes frequently

00:08:59.666 --> 00:09:02.506 A:middle
over its life, we would
change that or update

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:59.666 --> 00:09:02.506 A:middle
over its life, we would
change that or update

00:09:02.506 --> 00:09:04.636 A:middle
that with Accessibility Value.

00:09:05.486 --> 00:09:07.926 A:middle
So if this time we look
at the Clock element,

00:09:08.426 --> 00:09:10.186 A:middle
the value that changes
would be the time,

00:09:10.746 --> 00:09:15.156 A:middle
and so we would return the
string 11:20 a.m. and update

00:09:15.156 --> 00:09:16.626 A:middle
that accordingly as
the time changes.

00:09:17.286 --> 00:09:21.936 A:middle
So the next question is: How
should people interact with me?

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:26.496 A:middle
If the traits aren't enough
to describe how to interact

00:09:26.496 --> 00:09:28.306 A:middle
with an element, where you
need just a little bit more

00:09:28.306 --> 00:09:31.466 A:middle
information, you can provide
that with Accessibility Hint.

00:09:32.636 --> 00:09:35.306 A:middle
So if we look at the
grabber in World Clock,

00:09:35.846 --> 00:09:37.946 A:middle
we could set the hint to
something like, drag up

00:09:37.946 --> 00:09:39.136 A:middle
or down to change the order.

00:09:39.766 --> 00:09:41.406 A:middle
And this is, this describes

00:09:41.406 --> 00:09:43.326 A:middle
to the user exactly how
they can interact with it,

00:09:43.606 --> 00:09:47.706 A:middle
just a short description
of how to use it.

00:09:47.986 --> 00:09:49.396 A:middle
And finally: Where am I?

00:09:49.896 --> 00:09:51.556 A:middle
You may have noticed
that Switch Control

00:09:51.786 --> 00:09:54.866 A:middle
and VoiceOver have cursors
that move around the screen.

00:09:55.516 --> 00:09:57.476 A:middle
So we need to know where
to display that cursor.

00:09:58.036 --> 00:10:00.026 A:middle
So we answer that with
Accessibility Frame.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:58.036 --> 00:10:00.026 A:middle
So we answer that with
Accessibility Frame.

00:10:01.116 --> 00:10:03.766 A:middle
And that's how we draw the
beautiful cursor we see here.

00:10:04.756 --> 00:10:07.356 A:middle
It's important to
remember that the frame is

00:10:07.356 --> 00:10:09.696 A:middle
in screen coordinates, so
we provide a helper method

00:10:09.696 --> 00:10:11.536 A:middle
to convert from view
to screen coordinates.

00:10:12.556 --> 00:10:16.106 A:middle
Most of the time we assume this
to just be the frame of a view,

00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:18.846 A:middle
so you won't need to touch
this unless you need it

00:10:18.846 --> 00:10:20.776 A:middle
to be something a
little bit more specific.

00:10:21.436 --> 00:10:24.526 A:middle
And that's it!

00:10:24.876 --> 00:10:28.756 A:middle
Those six methods make up the
basic API for UI accessibility,

00:10:29.126 --> 00:10:31.646 A:middle
and that's enough to get
most of accessibility done,

00:10:32.126 --> 00:10:34.926 A:middle
so just a few lines of
code and a few minutes

00:10:35.126 --> 00:10:36.706 A:middle
to make your app
really accessible.

00:10:37.196 --> 00:10:41.536 A:middle
But the really great news
is we do most of the work.

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:44.716 A:middle
So if you use standard
controls in UIKit,

00:10:45.146 --> 00:10:46.476 A:middle
most of this is done for you.

00:10:47.056 --> 00:10:48.656 A:middle
If you do custom drawing,

00:10:48.996 --> 00:10:50.976 A:middle
we need you to answer
these questions for us

00:10:51.206 --> 00:10:54.456 A:middle
so accessibility users can know
how to interact with your app.

00:10:54.456 --> 00:10:57.136 A:middle
So just that really
small investment

00:10:57.446 --> 00:11:00.266 A:middle
of those six methods will
give you a large reward

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:57.446 --> 00:11:00.266 A:middle
of those six methods will
give you a large reward

00:11:00.266 --> 00:11:02.286 A:middle
of a lot more people being
able to use your app.

00:11:03.086 --> 00:11:06.776 A:middle
So it's not that much to
make something accessible.

00:11:07.386 --> 00:11:11.586 A:middle
So now your convinced:
accessibility, just six methods,

00:11:11.866 --> 00:11:13.886 A:middle
that's easy, how do I do it?

00:11:14.566 --> 00:11:16.706 A:middle
The first step is
design for accessibility.

00:11:17.116 --> 00:11:19.956 A:middle
So when you are thinking
about your app and thinking

00:11:19.956 --> 00:11:22.796 A:middle
about how users will use
the app you are building,

00:11:22.906 --> 00:11:24.866 A:middle
think about Switch
Control and VoiceOver users

00:11:25.326 --> 00:11:27.346 A:middle
and how they will
interact with your app.

00:11:28.666 --> 00:11:32.076 A:middle
But if you have an app already,
like we assume most of you do,

00:11:32.586 --> 00:11:34.836 A:middle
the best way to start is
do an audit of your app

00:11:34.836 --> 00:11:37.886 A:middle
and see how accessible it is
already, because, like I said,

00:11:37.986 --> 00:11:40.226 A:middle
if you use UIKit
standard controls,

00:11:40.296 --> 00:11:41.666 A:middle
most of this should
be done already.

00:11:42.826 --> 00:11:45.476 A:middle
There are a few ways to
do an accessibility audit.

00:11:46.046 --> 00:11:48.216 A:middle
The first one is the
accessibility inspector

00:11:48.706 --> 00:11:49.816 A:middle
in the simulator.

00:11:50.256 --> 00:11:52.586 A:middle
And you turn that on by
going to Settings, General,

00:11:52.986 --> 00:11:56.036 A:middle
Accessibility, and
turning on the inspector,

00:11:56.776 --> 00:11:58.636 A:middle
and you will notice that it
brings up this beautiful window

00:11:58.956 --> 00:12:01.206 A:middle
that answers those six questions
we have been talking about.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.956 --> 00:12:01.206 A:middle
that answers those six questions
we have been talking about.

00:12:01.566 --> 00:12:04.066 A:middle
So you can quickly spot check
the elements in your app

00:12:04.066 --> 00:12:06.796 A:middle
and make sure they are
responding as you expect.

00:12:07.296 --> 00:12:11.676 A:middle
The best way to check
for accessibility is

00:12:11.786 --> 00:12:14.306 A:middle
to use the accessibility
features on the device,

00:12:14.636 --> 00:12:16.396 A:middle
like VoiceOver and
Switch Control.

00:12:17.366 --> 00:12:19.746 A:middle
And I would love to
do that with you now.

00:12:20.726 --> 00:12:24.296 A:middle
So back in Settings, we can turn
on VoiceOver by going to the top

00:12:24.296 --> 00:12:28.366 A:middle
of Accessibility Settings, but
I would recommend if you are new

00:12:28.366 --> 00:12:33.136 A:middle
to VoiceOver to come down to the
Accessibility shortcut and turn

00:12:33.136 --> 00:12:36.276 A:middle
on VoiceOver, so that way you
can tap the Home button three

00:12:36.276 --> 00:12:38.236 A:middle
times anywhere in
the operating system

00:12:38.296 --> 00:12:39.666 A:middle
to turn VoiceOver on and off.

00:12:40.246 --> 00:12:42.406 A:middle
So if we go back
to the Home screen,

00:12:42.406 --> 00:12:46.546 A:middle
I will tap the Home
button three times.

00:12:46.616 --> 00:12:51.536 A:middle
There is VoiceOver telling
us it's on Messages,

00:12:51.536 --> 00:12:53.856 A:middle
so I will take one finger
and move it around the screen

00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:55.546 A:middle
and VoiceOver will read
what's under my finger.

00:12:56.506 --> 00:12:59.606 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: weather, clock,
map, videos, wallet, stocks,

00:12:59.666 --> 00:13:01.266 A:middle
reminders, two tasks due today.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.666 --> 00:13:01.266 A:middle
reminders, two tasks due today.

00:13:02.296 --> 00:13:03.026 A:middle
Double-tap to open.

00:13:03.026 --> 00:13:05.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: I have a few
more things to do today.

00:13:05.976 --> 00:13:06.276 A:middle
All right.

00:13:06.616 --> 00:13:08.576 A:middle
So if I take one
finger and swipe right,

00:13:08.576 --> 00:13:09.686 A:middle
it will move to the
next element.

00:13:09.876 --> 00:13:12.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Stocks,
double-tap to open.

00:13:12.786 --> 00:13:15.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: Tell me about
stocks, and if I take one finger

00:13:15.306 --> 00:13:21.696 A:middle
and slide to the left, it will
move to the previous element.

00:13:22.356 --> 00:13:25.706 A:middle
So double-tap with one finger
will activate an element,

00:13:26.126 --> 00:13:27.316 A:middle
so it will bring up Reminders.

00:13:27.626 --> 00:13:31.226 A:middle
And then the only other gesture

00:13:32.196 --> 00:13:37.126 A:middle
that you will need is a
three-finger gesture to scroll,

00:13:37.126 --> 00:13:41.526 A:middle
so I will take three fingers
and scroll to the next,

00:13:42.386 --> 00:13:43.966 A:middle
and previous, element,
and that's it.

00:13:43.966 --> 00:13:47.526 A:middle
Just the few gestures will
control VoiceOver and allow you

00:13:47.526 --> 00:13:48.856 A:middle
to check your app
for accessibility.

00:13:49.586 --> 00:13:53.886 A:middle
Let's take a look at Clock and
check it for accessibility.

00:13:53.886 --> 00:13:56.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Clock, 9:15
a.m. Double tap to open.

00:13:57.196 --> 00:13:58.166 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: Double
tap to open.

00:13:58.426 --> 00:13:59.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Clock,
edit, button.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:00.636 --> 00:14:02.586 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: When you are doing
an audit, you want to check

00:14:02.846 --> 00:14:05.516 A:middle
that everything has an
accessibility label,

00:14:05.516 --> 00:14:06.866 A:middle
it has a meaningful value.

00:14:06.866 --> 00:14:10.936 A:middle
If its state changes, you want
to swipe through the elements

00:14:11.286 --> 00:14:12.756 A:middle
and make sure that
the order makes sense

00:14:13.276 --> 00:14:15.146 A:middle
so that it's moving
from, generally,

00:14:15.316 --> 00:14:17.986 A:middle
top left to bottom right if you
are in a left-to-right language

00:14:18.026 --> 00:14:19.666 A:middle
and the reverse if you
are in a right-to-left.

00:14:20.346 --> 00:14:21.956 A:middle
So let's swipe through
and listen

00:14:21.956 --> 00:14:24.116 A:middle
to what VoiceOver
finds in this app.

00:14:24.836 --> 00:14:29.246 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: World clock,
heading, Cupertino, today,

00:14:29.436 --> 00:14:32.876 A:middle
9:16 a.m. Swipe up or down
to select a custom action,

00:14:33.076 --> 00:14:34.096 A:middle
then double-tap to activate.

00:14:34.566 --> 00:14:37.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: So VoiceOver
is telling us the label

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:39.306 A:middle
and the value.

00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:41.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Selected,
world clock, tap.

00:14:42.406 --> 00:14:43.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: This has
the Selected trait.

00:14:43.866 --> 00:14:45.036 A:middle
So that's another
trait you can add.

00:14:45.036 --> 00:14:48.866 A:middle
It tells us that there is three
more elements in the tab bar.

00:14:48.866 --> 00:14:50.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Alarm, tab.

00:14:51.206 --> 00:14:52.396 A:middle
Stopwatch, tab.

00:14:52.866 --> 00:14:53.706 A:middle
Timer, tab.

00:14:54.016 --> 00:14:54.446 A:middle
Four of four.

00:14:55.256 --> 00:14:58.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: So I can swipe
to everything in World Clock,

00:14:58.526 --> 00:14:59.506 A:middle
or at least on this screen,

00:14:59.506 --> 00:15:02.226 A:middle
everything has a label,
a meaningful value.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.506 --> 00:15:02.226 A:middle
everything has a label,
a meaningful value.

00:15:02.226 --> 00:15:03.486 A:middle
The traits are set properly.

00:15:03.906 --> 00:15:06.416 A:middle
So this looks pretty
accessible, that's good.

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:08.146 A:middle
So I will turn off
VoiceOver now.

00:15:08.646 --> 00:15:09.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Voiceover off.

00:15:10.056 --> 00:15:11.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: Let's
look at an app

00:15:11.046 --> 00:15:13.046 A:middle
that I brought called
QuakeWatch.

00:15:14.116 --> 00:15:17.366 A:middle
I'm from the Bay Area,
which means I'm obsessed

00:15:17.366 --> 00:15:21.166 A:middle
with earthquakes, so I wrote an
app that will track earthquakes

00:15:21.166 --> 00:15:23.046 A:middle
as they happen in real
time around the world.

00:15:24.376 --> 00:15:25.666 A:middle
Great for a native like me.

00:15:25.806 --> 00:15:27.786 A:middle
So you can see that
earthquakes are happening

00:15:28.426 --> 00:15:29.656 A:middle
or have happened recently.

00:15:30.086 --> 00:15:33.846 A:middle
And it will tell you where it
happened, when it happened,

00:15:34.376 --> 00:15:38.236 A:middle
and the text color tells you
the magnitude of the earthquake,

00:15:38.236 --> 00:15:39.386 A:middle
and we even get a
little map view.

00:15:39.556 --> 00:15:43.606 A:middle
So if I tap in, I can look

00:15:43.606 --> 00:15:46.216 A:middle
at the earthquake on
a map, I zoom out.

00:15:46.216 --> 00:15:50.556 A:middle
I should be able to find other
earthquakes, and I can tap

00:15:50.556 --> 00:15:52.986 A:middle
to get more information
about the earthquake.

00:15:52.986 --> 00:15:55.556 A:middle
There is even an Info button
that will take me to USGS

00:15:55.556 --> 00:15:57.916 A:middle
and give me even
more information.

00:15:57.986 --> 00:16:04.746 A:middle
I can tap and hold on a set
of earthquakes to add them

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:57.986 --> 00:16:04.746 A:middle
I can tap and hold on a set
of earthquakes to add them

00:16:04.746 --> 00:16:07.116 A:middle
to my favorite list
and even compare them.

00:16:08.126 --> 00:16:08.826 A:middle
Pretty cool app!

00:16:09.756 --> 00:16:11.246 A:middle
Best earthquake app
I have ever seen.

00:16:12.676 --> 00:16:14.266 A:middle
So if I triple-tap
with VoiceOver,

00:16:14.266 --> 00:16:19.666 A:middle
let's see what the VoiceOver
user would see with this app.

00:16:19.946 --> 00:16:20.556 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: VoiceOver on,

00:16:20.836 --> 00:16:22.646 A:middle
QuakeWatch, earthquakes,
heading.

00:16:23.536 --> 00:16:25.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: Earthquakes,
heading, so far so good.

00:16:25.336 --> 00:16:26.366 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Favorites, button.

00:16:27.126 --> 00:16:29.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: Favorites,
button, that's pretty good.

00:16:29.826 --> 00:16:31.806 A:middle
So these are standard
UIKit controls,

00:16:31.806 --> 00:16:32.636 A:middle
so I get them for free.

00:16:32.926 --> 00:16:33.466 A:middle
That's great.

00:16:33.836 --> 00:16:37.646 A:middle
Now, I will take my one
finger and slide around

00:16:37.856 --> 00:16:40.446 A:middle
and see what we find
with the cells.

00:16:41.516 --> 00:16:44.576 A:middle
[Tapping noise]

00:16:45.076 --> 00:16:49.146 A:middle
So that sound you are hearing
is VoiceOver telling you

00:16:49.146 --> 00:16:52.976 A:middle
that it can't find anything
to touch under that finger,

00:16:53.436 --> 00:16:55.216 A:middle
so the cells aren't accessible.

00:16:55.506 --> 00:16:56.116 A:middle
That's no good.

00:16:56.916 --> 00:17:00.396 A:middle
Let's go into the
favorites, look at that graph.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:56.916 --> 00:17:00.396 A:middle
Let's go into the
favorites, look at that graph.

00:17:01.516 --> 00:17:04.556 A:middle
[Tapping noise]

00:17:05.056 --> 00:17:06.626 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: It looks like the
graph isn't accessible either.

00:17:06.906 --> 00:17:11.026 A:middle
That's unfortunate,
such a beautiful graph.

00:17:11.455 --> 00:17:15.425 A:middle
So there is one more
gesture that might help you

00:17:15.425 --> 00:17:18.906 A:middle
as you are looking at your app,
if you do a double tap and hold,

00:17:19.316 --> 00:17:22.366 A:middle
VoiceOver will pass through
the touch and just push it

00:17:22.366 --> 00:17:24.396 A:middle
through to whatever
is under your finger.

00:17:24.906 --> 00:17:27.056 A:middle
So even though the
cell isn't accessible,

00:17:27.435 --> 00:17:29.046 A:middle
we can jump in and --

00:17:29.046 --> 00:17:31.586 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Earthquake,
shows more info, detail.

00:17:31.586 --> 00:17:32.166 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: Get to the view.

00:17:32.516 --> 00:17:34.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Detail,
earthquakes, back button.

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:35.656 A:middle
Earthquake.

00:17:36.666 --> 00:17:37.686 A:middle
Show more info.

00:17:37.686 --> 00:17:43.556 A:middle
Use the rotor to access
points of interest.

00:17:43.556 --> 00:17:43.706 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: All right.

00:17:43.706 --> 00:17:43.876 A:middle
Nice.

00:17:44.486 --> 00:17:47.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Earthquake,
location, 74 kilometers,

00:17:47.186 --> 00:17:51.446 A:middle
felt by zero people,
magnitude 1.50.

00:17:52.716 --> 00:17:53.556 A:middle
Dismiss pop up.

00:17:54.546 --> 00:17:55.156 A:middle
Double-tap to --

00:17:55.556 --> 00:17:58.136 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: It looks like the
Info button isn't accessible,

00:17:58.136 --> 00:17:59.516 A:middle
so VoiceOver just
doesn't see it.

00:17:59.916 --> 00:18:04.556 A:middle
So it's not very accessible
to a VoiceOver user.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.916 --> 00:18:04.556 A:middle
So it's not very accessible
to a VoiceOver user.

00:18:04.556 --> 00:18:06.406 A:middle
They can't really get to
any of the information,

00:18:06.506 --> 00:18:09.146 A:middle
so it's mostly useless.

00:18:10.186 --> 00:18:11.436 A:middle
Let's turn off VoiceOver.

00:18:12.836 --> 00:18:14.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: VoiceOver off.

00:18:14.996 --> 00:18:18.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: So
what did we find

00:18:18.706 --> 00:18:20.316 A:middle
with our accessibility audit?

00:18:20.316 --> 00:18:26.826 A:middle
We have got that earthquake
cell that just isn't accessible,

00:18:26.956 --> 00:18:28.496 A:middle
VoiceOver couldn't
see it at all,

00:18:28.926 --> 00:18:33.406 A:middle
and the text color is
communicating magnitude,

00:18:33.406 --> 00:18:36.216 A:middle
which isn't a great way
to communicate magnitude

00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:38.756 A:middle
because not everyone
can see all colors

00:18:38.756 --> 00:18:41.486 A:middle
and it's also just really
ugly and difficult to read,

00:18:41.486 --> 00:18:43.246 A:middle
as you can see with
the yellow here.

00:18:43.916 --> 00:18:48.176 A:middle
There is that map detail
view, where the labels need

00:18:48.176 --> 00:18:50.316 A:middle
to be a little more
specific about their purpose.

00:18:51.186 --> 00:18:54.016 A:middle
And that Info button
is completely invisible

00:18:54.016 --> 00:18:54.826 A:middle
to VoiceOver users.

00:18:56.406 --> 00:18:57.616 A:middle
So that's no good.

00:18:58.256 --> 00:19:00.836 A:middle
But the great news is those six
methods we have been talking

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.256 --> 00:19:00.836 A:middle
But the great news is those six
methods we have been talking

00:19:00.836 --> 00:19:03.526 A:middle
about so far are enough
to fix all of these issues

00:19:03.526 --> 00:19:05.216 A:middle
with just a few lines of
code in a few minutes.

00:19:05.816 --> 00:19:09.206 A:middle
So let's do that together now.

00:19:09.596 --> 00:19:10.386 A:middle
All right.

00:19:11.056 --> 00:19:15.746 A:middle
So here is QuakeWatch and
the first thing we will look

00:19:15.746 --> 00:19:17.736 A:middle
at is that earthquake cell.

00:19:19.916 --> 00:19:23.536 A:middle
The earthquake cell is
written in Swift and the rest

00:19:23.536 --> 00:19:25.586 A:middle
of the p roject is
in Objective-C,

00:19:25.886 --> 00:19:29.176 A:middle
so accessibility works
in both languages

00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:32.186 A:middle
and it can coexist just
like the rest of your code.

00:19:33.266 --> 00:19:34.226 A:middle
So let's see.

00:19:34.226 --> 00:19:35.886 A:middle
It's not accessible.

00:19:36.426 --> 00:19:38.876 A:middle
If we look down, we can see

00:19:38.876 --> 00:19:42.346 A:middle
that the reason it's not
accessible is I'm taking a

00:19:42.346 --> 00:19:44.136 A:middle
string and drawing
it at a point.

00:19:44.406 --> 00:19:48.566 A:middle
So if I used UI labels instead,
this would be accessible for me,

00:19:49.056 --> 00:19:51.146 A:middle
but because I'm drawing
the strings directly

00:19:51.146 --> 00:19:52.836 A:middle
into the view, it's
not accessible.

00:19:53.606 --> 00:19:58.546 A:middle
And then I'm grabbing
the alert color and using

00:19:58.546 --> 00:20:01.656 A:middle
that as the text color
for all of these strings.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:58.546 --> 00:20:01.656 A:middle
that as the text color
for all of these strings.

00:20:02.276 --> 00:20:05.416 A:middle
So the first thing we
should do is get rid of that

00:20:05.416 --> 00:20:08.696 A:middle
and instead use UI
color black color.

00:20:09.596 --> 00:20:10.636 A:middle
Now, we will all
be able to read it.

00:20:10.716 --> 00:20:11.316 A:middle
Won't that be great?

00:20:12.626 --> 00:20:17.256 A:middle
And now that we aren't using
that for the magnitude,

00:20:17.966 --> 00:20:21.596 A:middle
let's just keep up with that
trend and add a magnitude string

00:20:21.596 --> 00:20:24.716 A:middle
that we draw directly
to the view.

00:20:24.906 --> 00:20:25.386 A:middle
Why not? All right.

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:28.316 A:middle
So that will take care
of the text color.

00:20:29.346 --> 00:20:30.676 A:middle
How do we make it accessible?

00:20:31.116 --> 00:20:34.266 A:middle
If we come up here to where we
set the earthquake on the cell,

00:20:35.256 --> 00:20:41.386 A:middle
we can grab the date that
the earthquake happened,

00:20:41.666 --> 00:20:43.976 A:middle
and a handy event
description that will tell us

00:20:43.976 --> 00:20:47.946 A:middle
where it happened, and format
it correctly, obviously.

00:20:48.246 --> 00:20:51.446 A:middle
We will set Is Accessibility
Element to True on the cell

00:20:51.706 --> 00:20:53.136 A:middle
so VoiceOver will
be able to find it,

00:20:53.136 --> 00:20:54.476 A:middle
and then we will set the label

00:20:54.476 --> 00:20:57.126 A:middle
to the description
we just built.

00:20:58.006 --> 00:20:58.866 A:middle
Okay. Great!

00:20:59.416 --> 00:21:00.986 A:middle
The only other thing
we might want

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.416 --> 00:21:00.986 A:middle
The only other thing
we might want

00:21:00.986 --> 00:21:03.776 A:middle
to add is a value
for that favorite.

00:21:04.816 --> 00:21:06.166 A:middle
When you add something
to a favorites list,

00:21:06.396 --> 00:21:08.036 A:middle
obviously a VoiceOver user
would want to know that.

00:21:08.896 --> 00:21:12.436 A:middle
Down here where we
toggle the favorite,

00:21:12.846 --> 00:21:17.326 A:middle
we can add a little bit of code

00:21:17.326 --> 00:21:19.686 A:middle
that sets the accessibility
value

00:21:19.756 --> 00:21:23.086 A:middle
to Favorite if it's a favorite.

00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:27.146 A:middle
So let's take a look
at the popover view.

00:21:27.556 --> 00:21:30.446 A:middle
I happen to know it's here.

00:21:31.626 --> 00:21:35.716 A:middle
So it looks like that button
is actually a UI control,

00:21:35.876 --> 00:21:38.256 A:middle
which would explain why
it's not accessible.

00:21:38.456 --> 00:21:41.776 A:middle
If I had used a UI button,
this would be accessible

00:21:41.776 --> 00:21:44.306 A:middle
from the start, but we
need a little bit of help

00:21:44.306 --> 00:21:45.496 A:middle
to make it accessible.

00:21:46.916 --> 00:21:50.826 A:middle
So let's do that now.

00:21:50.826 --> 00:21:54.786 A:middle
So we will take the More Info
button, set Is Accessibility

00:21:54.786 --> 00:21:58.716 A:middle
to Yes, add the Button trait,
and then we'll set the label

00:21:58.716 --> 00:22:01.316 A:middle
to More Info and the
hint to Double-Tap

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.716 --> 00:22:01.316 A:middle
to More Info and the
hint to Double-Tap

00:22:01.346 --> 00:22:02.276 A:middle
To View More Information.

00:22:03.366 --> 00:22:04.916 A:middle
And obviously you would
want to localize this,

00:22:05.466 --> 00:22:08.496 A:middle
but for now we will
leave it this way.

00:22:09.706 --> 00:22:15.846 A:middle
The only other thing we want to
do here is set the Header trait

00:22:16.266 --> 00:22:19.256 A:middle
on the location and felt
header, so it's clear what's

00:22:19.356 --> 00:22:22.416 A:middle
in that view and
what information is

00:22:22.416 --> 00:22:23.106 A:middle
being communicated.

00:22:24.086 --> 00:22:28.076 A:middle
That was just a few minutes
of work, and that should clean

00:22:28.076 --> 00:22:29.146 A:middle
up quite a few issues.

00:22:29.306 --> 00:22:33.866 A:middle
Let's build and check it out.

00:22:33.866 --> 00:22:34.196 A:middle
All right.

00:22:34.196 --> 00:22:36.446 A:middle
Let's triple-tap home to
turn VoiceOver back on.

00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:38.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: VoiceOver on.

00:22:38.456 --> 00:22:41.966 A:middle
FaceTime, QuakeWatch,
double-tap to open,

00:22:42.576 --> 00:22:44.456 A:middle
QuakeWatch, earthquakes,
heading.

00:22:46.366 --> 00:22:47.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: The first
thing you notice is

00:22:47.746 --> 00:22:49.836 A:middle
that ugly yellow
color is finally gone.

00:22:50.216 --> 00:22:50.826 A:middle
Thank goodness!

00:22:51.656 --> 00:22:55.036 A:middle
So let's swipe around with one
finger and see what happens.

00:22:55.286 --> 00:22:57.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Favorites,
button, 12 kilometers,

00:22:57.936 --> 00:23:02.436 A:middle
Oklahoma, 2015, 10:57 a.m.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:57.936 --> 00:23:02.436 A:middle
Oklahoma, 2015, 10:57 a.m.

00:23:02.436 --> 00:23:04.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: So earthquake
finds the cell now.

00:23:04.546 --> 00:23:10.716 A:middle
That's good if we come
to the detail view.

00:23:11.616 --> 00:23:14.566 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Dismiss
earthquake, location, heading.

00:23:14.966 --> 00:23:16.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: Location
now has the heading trait,

00:23:17.086 --> 00:23:18.506 A:middle
so it's clear what's
happening in the view.

00:23:18.506 --> 00:23:19.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: 12 kilometers.

00:23:19.426 --> 00:23:21.256 A:middle
Felt by, heading, zero people.

00:23:22.456 --> 00:23:25.076 A:middle
Magnitude 3.00.

00:23:25.346 --> 00:23:26.486 A:middle
More info, button.

00:23:26.486 --> 00:23:27.836 A:middle
Double-tap to view
more information.

00:23:28.196 --> 00:23:29.606 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: The More Info
button is now accessible

00:23:29.606 --> 00:23:34.036 A:middle
and tells us how to use
it and what it will do.

00:23:34.166 --> 00:23:36.566 A:middle
Great! Just a few lines of
code and we were able to clean

00:23:36.566 --> 00:23:38.776 A:middle
up the app and make
it pretty accessible.

00:23:39.276 --> 00:23:40.386 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: VoiceOver off.

00:23:40.736 --> 00:23:43.456 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: So where
did we get so far?

00:23:43.806 --> 00:23:45.516 A:middle
The earthquake cell
is now accessible,

00:23:45.516 --> 00:23:46.626 A:middle
we are not communicating
anything

00:23:46.626 --> 00:23:48.976 A:middle
with text color anymore,
which is really great,

00:23:48.976 --> 00:23:50.656 A:middle
that ugly yellow
is finally gone.

00:23:51.246 --> 00:23:53.576 A:middle
The map detail view now
has meaningful traits

00:23:53.576 --> 00:23:55.016 A:middle
on those labels so it's clear

00:23:55.016 --> 00:23:57.446 A:middle
to the VoiceOver user what's
happening and they can navigate

00:23:57.476 --> 00:23:58.446 A:middle
by headings if they like.

00:23:59.026 --> 00:24:00.836 A:middle
That Info button it accessible.

00:23:59.026 --> 00:24:00.836 A:middle
That Info button it accessible.

00:24:01.076 --> 00:24:05.286 A:middle
We still need a way to add
something to the favorite list,

00:24:06.066 --> 00:24:09.366 A:middle
and the favorite graph
is still inaccessible.

00:24:10.316 --> 00:24:14.566 A:middle
How would we make
this graph accessible?

00:24:15.596 --> 00:24:17.916 A:middle
So let's start by going back

00:24:17.916 --> 00:24:19.706 A:middle
to those questions we were
talking about earlier.

00:24:19.916 --> 00:24:21.476 A:middle
The first one was:
Do I serve a purpose?

00:24:21.536 --> 00:24:24.666 A:middle
So there is a lot of
information being communicated

00:24:24.666 --> 00:24:29.016 A:middle
in this graph, but not all of
it is really serving a purpose

00:24:29.016 --> 00:24:30.186 A:middle
or really important to the user.

00:24:30.186 --> 00:24:32.226 A:middle
So what's the most
important bits in this graph?

00:24:32.226 --> 00:24:34.366 A:middle
I think that's the points,

00:24:34.796 --> 00:24:36.876 A:middle
because they tell us exactly
what we are comparing,

00:24:37.046 --> 00:24:39.376 A:middle
so that's probably what
we should make accessible.

00:24:40.666 --> 00:24:43.316 A:middle
The next question that's worth
talking about is: Where am I?

00:24:43.676 --> 00:24:45.866 A:middle
So what do we set for
the accessibility frame

00:24:46.026 --> 00:24:46.656 A:middle
for these points?

00:24:47.866 --> 00:24:50.596 A:middle
So you might think
that the orange boxes

00:24:50.596 --> 00:24:55.696 A:middle
that you see now are a
good idea, but if you look

00:24:55.696 --> 00:24:59.066 A:middle
at the view as a whole,
most of it isn't accessible.

00:24:59.946 --> 00:25:03.806 A:middle
So most of it is
just dead space,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:59.946 --> 00:25:03.806 A:middle
So most of it is
just dead space,

00:25:04.216 --> 00:25:06.846 A:middle
and so as a VoiceOver
user slides their finger

00:25:06.846 --> 00:25:09.526 A:middle
around the screen to search for
points, it will be mostly empty.

00:25:10.236 --> 00:25:13.456 A:middle
A better frame might
be something like this.

00:25:13.946 --> 00:25:16.626 A:middle
So a VoiceOver user can
slide his or her finger

00:25:16.626 --> 00:25:18.416 A:middle
across the screen,
and they will hit all

00:25:18.416 --> 00:25:19.496 A:middle
of the points as they do so.

00:25:19.496 --> 00:25:22.316 A:middle
And then as long as we set
the accessibility value

00:25:22.316 --> 00:25:24.616 A:middle
to the magnitude, we
haven't lost anything.

00:25:24.616 --> 00:25:26.446 A:middle
We haven't lost any information.

00:25:26.766 --> 00:25:28.556 A:middle
So that seems like a good plan.

00:25:29.456 --> 00:25:30.896 A:middle
Unfortunately, I happen to know

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:33.976 A:middle
that the graph view
is just one big view,

00:25:33.976 --> 00:25:36.296 A:middle
and everything is drawn
directly into the view.

00:25:36.696 --> 00:25:42.056 A:middle
So how do we make one view
accessible into multiple parts?

00:25:42.896 --> 00:25:45.406 A:middle
And the good news is we have
got an API for that as well,

00:25:45.406 --> 00:25:47.176 A:middle
UIAccessibility element.

00:25:47.236 --> 00:25:51.286 A:middle
So this is a great way to
create specific objects just

00:25:51.286 --> 00:25:54.416 A:middle
for accessibility to break
up a view into subelements

00:25:54.816 --> 00:25:57.186 A:middle
and still answer those great
six questions we have been

00:25:57.186 --> 00:25:57.826 A:middle
talking about.

00:25:58.486 --> 00:26:01.266 A:middle
The only new part is the
accessibility container,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:58.486 --> 00:26:01.266 A:middle
The only new part is the
accessibility container,

00:26:01.266 --> 00:26:03.136 A:middle
which you would just set
to the containing view.

00:26:04.106 --> 00:26:07.616 A:middle
Great! So with this API, we
can make the graph accessible.

00:26:08.216 --> 00:26:10.506 A:middle
How do we add something
to that favorite list

00:26:10.816 --> 00:26:12.686 A:middle
so there is something
to display on the graph?

00:26:13.276 --> 00:26:17.036 A:middle
For that I think we should use
Accessibility Perform Magic Tap,

00:26:17.626 --> 00:26:18.716 A:middle
which is this really cool API

00:26:18.716 --> 00:26:21.626 A:middle
to just do the right thing
in the right context.

00:26:22.416 --> 00:26:24.436 A:middle
A good example of that is

00:26:24.516 --> 00:26:26.096 A:middle
when a VoiceOver user
gets a phone call,

00:26:26.306 --> 00:26:29.666 A:middle
they can do the Magic Tap
gesture, which is two fingers,

00:26:30.006 --> 00:26:32.776 A:middle
double-tap on the screen, and
that will do the magic thing,

00:26:32.866 --> 00:26:34.576 A:middle
which is answer the phone call.

00:26:35.406 --> 00:26:38.496 A:middle
So that will allow us to add
something to the favorite list,

00:26:39.446 --> 00:26:41.376 A:middle
but what do we add to the list?

00:26:42.256 --> 00:26:44.046 A:middle
And for that we can
use some brand-new API

00:26:44.206 --> 00:26:46.846 A:middle
in iOS 9 called Accessibility
Focus.

00:26:46.956 --> 00:26:50.256 A:middle
This will allow you to get
the currently focused element

00:26:50.436 --> 00:26:51.956 A:middle
for a given assistive technology

00:26:52.256 --> 00:26:53.726 A:middle
like VoiceOver or
Switch Control.

00:26:54.436 --> 00:26:56.486 A:middle
If you are interested in
tracking focus as it moves

00:26:56.486 --> 00:26:59.196 A:middle
around your app, we
provide a notification

00:26:59.536 --> 00:27:02.216 A:middle
that will tell you the
currently focused element

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:59.536 --> 00:27:02.216 A:middle
that will tell you the
currently focused element

00:27:02.406 --> 00:27:03.706 A:middle
and the previously
focused element

00:27:03.706 --> 00:27:05.086 A:middle
for a given assistive
technology.

00:27:05.796 --> 00:27:08.356 A:middle
We know what to add
to the favorites list,

00:27:08.356 --> 00:27:11.186 A:middle
we know how to add it, and
then we can explore the graph.

00:27:11.496 --> 00:27:14.596 A:middle
So let's look at
implementing that now.

00:27:20.116 --> 00:27:20.546 A:middle
All right.

00:27:20.626 --> 00:27:22.036 A:middle
Back in Xcode.

00:27:23.096 --> 00:27:26.986 A:middle
So let's add something
to the favorite list.

00:27:27.986 --> 00:27:29.576 A:middle
So if we go to the app delegate,

00:27:30.746 --> 00:27:35.956 A:middle
we can add Accessibility
Perform Magic Tap.

00:27:36.266 --> 00:27:39.526 A:middle
So we will grab the currently
focused element for VoiceOver,

00:27:40.366 --> 00:27:43.246 A:middle
check if that element
responds to toggle favorite,

00:27:43.276 --> 00:27:46.286 A:middle
like the cell, and if it
does, we will ask it to toggle

00:27:46.286 --> 00:27:47.696 A:middle
as favorite and then return Yes.

00:27:48.206 --> 00:27:49.506 A:middle
Otherwise, we return No,

00:27:49.946 --> 00:27:52.416 A:middle
and VoiceOver will do the
next-most-magical thing

00:27:52.566 --> 00:27:54.356 A:middle
in that context,
whatever that may be.

00:27:54.856 --> 00:27:59.186 A:middle
So that will allow us to add
something to the favorite list.

00:27:59.616 --> 00:28:01.456 A:middle
Now, let's look at the graph.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.616 --> 00:28:01.456 A:middle
Now, let's look at the graph.

00:28:02.556 --> 00:28:03.716 A:middle
All right.

00:28:03.766 --> 00:28:07.096 A:middle
So it looks like I'm
drawing it with CAShapeLayer,

00:28:07.236 --> 00:28:09.526 A:middle
which is a great way to draw
a graph, but not a great way

00:28:09.526 --> 00:28:11.586 A:middle
to draw an accessible graph.

00:28:11.836 --> 00:28:15.456 A:middle
So down here I'm actually
grabbing the point

00:28:15.596 --> 00:28:16.966 A:middle
and drawing it.

00:28:17.616 --> 00:28:19.056 A:middle
So that seems like a good place

00:28:19.096 --> 00:28:22.366 A:middle
to create my UIAccessibility
element.

00:28:23.946 --> 00:28:28.376 A:middle
So I create a UIAccessibility
element, setting its container

00:28:28.376 --> 00:28:30.096 A:middle
to Self, the graph view.

00:28:30.146 --> 00:28:35.186 A:middle
And then I set its label to a
formatted version of the date.

00:28:35.816 --> 00:28:37.336 A:middle
So we know when it happened.

00:28:37.846 --> 00:28:40.456 A:middle
We will set the value to
the magnitude description.

00:28:40.966 --> 00:28:42.146 A:middle
That's good.

00:28:42.266 --> 00:28:45.976 A:middle
And then like we talked about,
I will take the frame and set it

00:28:45.976 --> 00:28:49.216 A:middle
to slightly wider
than the point,

00:28:49.746 --> 00:28:51.756 A:middle
and the full height
of the graph.

00:28:51.756 --> 00:28:56.226 A:middle
I will set that as the
frame after converting it

00:28:56.306 --> 00:28:57.676 A:middle
to screen coordinates.

00:28:58.496 --> 00:29:03.576 A:middle
And finally add that to
an array that I had ready,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.496 --> 00:29:03.576 A:middle
And finally add that to
an array that I had ready,

00:29:03.976 --> 00:29:06.396 A:middle
and set that as the
accessibility elements

00:29:06.756 --> 00:29:07.436 A:middle
for the graph view.

00:29:08.456 --> 00:29:10.396 A:middle
So just a few more
lines of code.

00:29:10.936 --> 00:29:12.976 A:middle
Let's see what that looks like.

00:29:18.516 --> 00:29:19.066 A:middle
All right.

00:29:19.116 --> 00:29:22.066 A:middle
So I will triple-tap
Home and start VoiceOver.

00:29:22.196 --> 00:29:22.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: VoiceOver on.

00:29:23.136 --> 00:29:25.096 A:middle
FaceTime, QuakeWatch.

00:29:25.936 --> 00:29:26.826 A:middle
Double-tap to open.

00:29:26.826 --> 00:29:27.316 A:middle
QuakeWatch.

00:29:27.616 --> 00:29:28.646 A:middle
Earthquakes, heading.

00:29:28.936 --> 00:29:30.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: There's
those beautiful cells.

00:29:30.086 --> 00:29:33.386 A:middle
I will do the Magic Tap
gesture, which is two fingers,

00:29:33.386 --> 00:29:34.566 A:middle
double-tap on the screen.

00:29:35.276 --> 00:29:39.196 A:middle
And there it is,
now it's a favorite.

00:29:39.386 --> 00:29:40.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: 12 kilometers.

00:29:40.726 --> 00:29:43.926 A:middle
California 2015.

00:29:44.096 --> 00:29:46.116 A:middle
11:10 a.m. Favorite.

00:29:46.496 --> 00:29:47.546 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: It
says it's a favorite.

00:29:47.646 --> 00:29:48.586 A:middle
That's good.

00:29:49.106 --> 00:29:50.026 A:middle
So let's add a few more.

00:29:51.356 --> 00:29:54.196 A:middle
First, we have to wait
for earthquakes to happen.

00:29:54.196 --> 00:29:55.186 A:middle
All right.

00:29:55.856 --> 00:29:57.786 A:middle
Three should be enough.

00:29:58.906 --> 00:30:00.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Detail,
back button.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:58.906 --> 00:30:00.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: Detail,
back button.

00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:02.366 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: Let's
see what happens

00:30:02.366 --> 00:30:04.806 A:middle
when we swipe around the graph.

00:30:05.346 --> 00:30:11.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VOICEOVER: 2005, 2/5, 2015.

00:30:11.416 --> 00:30:12.286 A:middle
Pacific Time.

00:30:12.566 --> 00:30:15.086 A:middle
Magnitude 0.43.

00:30:15.086 --> 00:30:16.276 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IAN FISCH: As I
slide my finger across,

00:30:16.276 --> 00:30:19.856 A:middle
I should hit all of them.

00:30:20.066 --> 00:30:23.486 A:middle
And that's how you make
a graphic accessible,

00:30:23.486 --> 00:30:24.976 A:middle
an earthquake graph
accessible, at least.

00:30:25.786 --> 00:30:27.836 A:middle
So just a few lines of
code, and we were able

00:30:27.836 --> 00:30:32.306 A:middle
to clean all of that up.

00:30:32.696 --> 00:30:33.786 A:middle
Let's take one more look,

00:30:33.786 --> 00:30:35.996 A:middle
we have the earthquake
cell is now accessible,

00:30:35.996 --> 00:30:37.596 A:middle
not using yellow
anymore, thank goodness.

00:30:38.186 --> 00:30:40.156 A:middle
The map detail is accessible.

00:30:40.526 --> 00:30:43.186 A:middle
We can add a favorite
using the Magic Tap,

00:30:44.146 --> 00:30:47.256 A:middle
and we can even explore the
graph and compare earthquakes,

00:30:47.746 --> 00:30:49.256 A:middle
our favorite earthquakes,
at least.

00:30:50.586 --> 00:30:52.826 A:middle
So just a few lines of
code, just a few minutes,

00:30:52.826 --> 00:30:55.816 A:middle
and we were able to take an app
that was completely unusable

00:30:55.816 --> 00:30:59.526 A:middle
for VoiceOver users and make
it probably the most accessible

00:30:59.526 --> 00:31:01.496 A:middle
earthquake tracking
app out there.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.526 --> 00:31:01.496 A:middle
earthquake tracking
app out there.

00:31:04.926 --> 00:31:08.156 A:middle
Remember that accessibility
is about users.

00:31:08.346 --> 00:31:09.896 A:middle
Thinking about how users

00:31:09.896 --> 00:31:11.926 A:middle
of all abilities will
interact with your app.

00:31:12.596 --> 00:31:14.776 A:middle
Remember everyone that's
going to be using your app

00:31:14.776 --> 00:31:16.686 A:middle
as you are designing it.

00:31:16.836 --> 00:31:18.666 A:middle
Apple has been embracing
accessibility

00:31:18.666 --> 00:31:20.886 A:middle
for so long that's
it's expected of us

00:31:20.926 --> 00:31:24.176 A:middle
that we are fully accessible
with all of the products

00:31:24.176 --> 00:31:25.116 A:middle
and features that we release.

00:31:25.396 --> 00:31:30.586 A:middle
And we really strive hard
to make that possible.

00:31:31.236 --> 00:31:33.486 A:middle
We would like to invite you
to join us in that endeavor

00:31:33.686 --> 00:31:37.016 A:middle
and make the ecosystem as
a whole really accessible.

00:31:38.466 --> 00:31:40.236 A:middle
If you would like more
information, you can search

00:31:40.236 --> 00:31:42.836 A:middle
for UIAccessibility
on developer.apple

00:31:43.196 --> 00:31:44.396 A:middle
or check the developer forums.

00:31:45.216 --> 00:31:47.736 A:middle
We also have an Apple
Watch session later today

00:31:48.256 --> 00:31:51.166 A:middle
and an Accessibility and
Speech Lab right after that.

00:31:51.586 --> 00:31:52.596 A:middle
So you can bring your app,

00:31:52.836 --> 00:31:54.866 A:middle
and we will help you
make certain parts

00:31:54.866 --> 00:31:56.806 A:middle
of your app accessible,
or you can just sit

00:31:56.806 --> 00:31:59.836 A:middle
with an accessibility expert and
go through an audit of your app

00:31:59.836 --> 00:32:01.566 A:middle
and see how accessible
it is already.

seeing everyone there.
