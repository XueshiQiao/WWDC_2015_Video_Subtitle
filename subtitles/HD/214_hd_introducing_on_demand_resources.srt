&gt;&gt; STEVE LEWALLEN:
Well, good afternoon!

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:29.066 A:middle
And welcome to today's session
introducing On Demand Resources.

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.166 A:middle
My name is Steve Lewallen.

00:00:30.216 --> 00:00:31.736 A:middle
So what do we have
for you today?

00:00:32.396 --> 00:00:35.176 A:middle
Well, we're going to begin
by giving you an overview

00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:38.126 A:middle
of On Demand Resources,
or ODR, and we're going

00:00:38.126 --> 00:00:41.846 A:middle
to compare an application built
with ODR to one built without.

00:00:41.846 --> 00:00:45.456 A:middle
We will follow that by listing
all the features and benefits

00:00:45.456 --> 00:00:48.406 A:middle
to you, the developer, as well
as to users of ODR applications.

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.796 A:middle
Then we will deep dive into
a bit of the details of ODR,

00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:55.836 A:middle
how an ODR application is
structured, how you build one.

00:00:56.486 --> 00:01:00.036 A:middle
We will follow that up by
giving you a demo using Xcode



00:00:56.486 --> 00:01:00.036 A:middle
We will follow that up by
giving you a demo using Xcode

00:01:00.396 --> 00:01:03.136 A:middle
and the new ODR API we
have added to Foundation.

00:01:04.575 --> 00:01:07.116 A:middle
And finally, we will wrap
things up with a segment

00:01:07.116 --> 00:01:09.136 A:middle
on best practices in using

00:01:09.136 --> 00:01:11.316 A:middle
and building the
optimal ODR application.

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:12.896 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:01:12.896 --> 00:01:16.416 A:middle
So to understand where
we are going with ODR,

00:01:16.416 --> 00:01:18.416 A:middle
we need to understand
where we are today

00:01:18.416 --> 00:01:19.756 A:middle
with the traditional
application.

00:01:20.506 --> 00:01:23.476 A:middle
Now, this application will
have an executable segment.

00:01:23.476 --> 00:01:25.786 A:middle
This is your compiled
Swift, Objective-C,

00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:30.456 A:middle
C++ as well as some base
resources, and the levels

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:32.186 A:middle
in the game, for example,
if this is a game.

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:35.636 A:middle
When you, the developer,
are happy with this game

00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:37.436 A:middle
or application, you
upload it to the store,

00:01:38.216 --> 00:01:40.996 A:middle
and when the user comes
along and buys the app

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:43.456 A:middle
or game they get the
entire thing and down

00:01:43.456 --> 00:01:44.566 A:middle
to the device it goes.

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:46.536 A:middle
And there it is not alone.

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:49.636 A:middle
Here we have all the other
compelling applications

00:01:49.636 --> 00:01:51.106 A:middle
and games that you,
the developer,

00:01:51.106 --> 00:01:52.726 A:middle
are writing for all
of these users.

00:01:52.996 --> 00:01:55.616 A:middle
In fact they are so compelling
that they can't get enough

00:01:55.696 --> 00:01:58.416 A:middle
of them and literally
this means more

00:01:58.416 --> 00:02:00.996 A:middle
and more the case this
is literally true.



00:01:58.416 --> 00:02:00.996 A:middle
and more the case this
is literally true.

00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:03.556 A:middle
There just is not enough
space on the device.

00:02:04.146 --> 00:02:05.326 A:middle
So what are we to do?

00:02:05.806 --> 00:02:08.466 A:middle
Well, one thing we can do
is make the observation

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:11.376 A:middle
that not every part of every
app is needed at any one time.

00:02:11.536 --> 00:02:12.706 A:middle
I will give an example.

00:02:12.806 --> 00:02:15.276 A:middle
I may be on Level 7 of a game.

00:02:15.786 --> 00:02:17.886 A:middle
I certainly don't need
Level 1 any longer

00:02:17.886 --> 00:02:20.986 A:middle
and I probably won't need
Level 30 for quite a while.

00:02:21.336 --> 00:02:22.896 A:middle
So it's with that
thought that we started

00:02:22.896 --> 00:02:24.836 A:middle
to begin to think about ODR.

00:02:25.136 --> 00:02:27.456 A:middle
So now let's look at
an ODR application.

00:02:28.316 --> 00:02:31.386 A:middle
In this case, we start
off with the same bits,

00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:33.586 A:middle
we haven't taken anything
away, but what we're going

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:35.776 A:middle
to do is we are going to
tease apart the assets

00:02:35.776 --> 00:02:37.106 A:middle
for each level of that game.

00:02:37.606 --> 00:02:39.966 A:middle
And then we are going to upload
the entire thing to the store.

00:02:40.786 --> 00:02:43.016 A:middle
Now, when a customer comes
along and buys the app,

00:02:44.276 --> 00:02:46.316 A:middle
they get the executable
and the base resources

00:02:46.426 --> 00:02:48.186 A:middle
and perhaps the first
level in the game.

00:02:49.246 --> 00:02:51.956 A:middle
So no pun intended we are
already ahead of the game here

00:02:51.956 --> 00:02:54.896 A:middle
because they were able to arrive
at the first level of the game,

00:02:55.346 --> 00:02:57.726 A:middle
the time between buying the app
and playing that first level,

00:02:58.026 --> 00:02:59.446 A:middle
much more quickly
than if they had

00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:02.836 A:middle
to download the entire
app first and they had



00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:02.836 A:middle
to download the entire
app first and they had

00:03:02.836 --> 00:03:05.716 A:middle
to use far less disk
space to do it.

00:03:06.136 --> 00:03:08.026 A:middle
Now, the user starts
playing this game

00:03:08.026 --> 00:03:10.646 A:middle
and the first level is in use.

00:03:10.986 --> 00:03:13.926 A:middle
And a well-designed ODR
application will anticipate

00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:15.796 A:middle
needing, say, the next
level in the game.

00:03:16.076 --> 00:03:17.866 A:middle
So it will download that.

00:03:18.326 --> 00:03:21.646 A:middle
The user continues to play,
they move on to Level 2,

00:03:21.646 --> 00:03:25.006 A:middle
and at this point, the
caching mechanism built

00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:27.646 A:middle
into ODR notices you are
no longer using Level 2,

00:03:27.646 --> 00:03:29.216 A:middle
well I'm just going to
make a note of that.

00:03:29.216 --> 00:03:31.576 A:middle
It's still there, we haven't
done anything with it,

00:03:31.576 --> 00:03:33.516 A:middle
but we're just going to
remember it's no longer needed.

00:03:34.156 --> 00:03:37.296 A:middle
So this continues until we
get to the point, perhaps,

00:03:37.296 --> 00:03:38.976 A:middle
where there is no more
space on the device

00:03:38.976 --> 00:03:40.966 A:middle
for the next level of the game.

00:03:40.966 --> 00:03:43.996 A:middle
We have looked at every other
possible place on the device

00:03:44.066 --> 00:03:48.256 A:middle
to free up resources and all
we have left is ODR content

00:03:48.406 --> 00:03:49.166 A:middle
from this game.

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:52.446 A:middle
In this case, the caching
mechanism can step in again

00:03:52.446 --> 00:03:55.566 A:middle
and say, you know, I had
Level 1, I can free that up

00:03:55.566 --> 00:03:58.746 A:middle
and now the user can
continue on with the game

00:03:58.746 --> 00:03:59.876 A:middle
and play the next level.



00:04:00.726 --> 00:04:02.886 A:middle
So this is the basic
idea behind ODR;

00:04:02.886 --> 00:04:07.226 A:middle
in the case of a game it's fast
to first play from buy to play

00:04:07.756 --> 00:04:10.846 A:middle
and it's always occupying a
smaller, more manageable amount

00:04:10.846 --> 00:04:14.986 A:middle
of space on the device.

00:04:15.496 --> 00:04:18.266 A:middle
So now let's talk about
all of the features of ODR

00:04:18.266 --> 00:04:20.426 A:middle
that we provide you,
the developers.

00:04:21.505 --> 00:04:25.096 A:middle
First of all, obviously this
is a dynamically loaded content

00:04:25.096 --> 00:04:27.376 A:middle
system and you have
probably used systems sort

00:04:27.376 --> 00:04:30.056 A:middle
of like this before, but we
have added some new wrinkles.

00:04:30.656 --> 00:04:32.326 A:middle
First of all we are
going to host the content

00:04:32.326 --> 00:04:34.516 A:middle
on the App Store right
along with your app.

00:04:35.336 --> 00:04:39.336 A:middle
Second of all, we can download
content during app install

00:04:39.336 --> 00:04:42.556 A:middle
as well as by request and
in fact we can automate,

00:04:43.796 --> 00:04:49.326 A:middle
we can automate this
content download at any time.

00:04:49.466 --> 00:04:52.596 A:middle
And finally, we also include an
intelligent caching mechanism

00:04:52.596 --> 00:04:53.166 A:middle
that I mentioned.

00:04:53.956 --> 00:04:58.236 A:middle
So, for example, we can free
up space to load something new.

00:04:58.616 --> 00:05:04.366 A:middle
And finally, a traditional app
maxes out at 4-gig submission



00:04:58.616 --> 00:05:04.366 A:middle
And finally, a traditional app
maxes out at 4-gig submission

00:05:04.366 --> 00:05:08.596 A:middle
in the Store, but with
ODR your app can now be

00:05:08.626 --> 00:05:09.876 A:middle
up to 20 gigabytes.

00:05:10.566 --> 00:05:14.036 A:middle
Most of this, of
course, is ODR content.

00:05:14.036 --> 00:05:14.266 A:middle
All right.

00:05:15.056 --> 00:05:16.676 A:middle
So that's what's in it
for you, the developer,

00:05:16.676 --> 00:05:17.826 A:middle
but what's in it for the user?

00:05:19.176 --> 00:05:23.436 A:middle
Well, first of all, we can
improve the install experience.

00:05:24.106 --> 00:05:28.556 A:middle
A traditional DLC system, a game
written using such a technology,

00:05:28.906 --> 00:05:30.996 A:middle
provides an experience
something like this:

00:05:30.996 --> 00:05:33.576 A:middle
the user downloads the
app, they are all excited

00:05:33.576 --> 00:05:34.546 A:middle
about playing the game.

00:05:34.786 --> 00:05:37.786 A:middle
They launch it, but oh no,
the game now needs to go

00:05:37.786 --> 00:05:39.736 A:middle
and download new content.

00:05:39.736 --> 00:05:43.546 A:middle
With ODR we can make sure that
that content is on the device

00:05:43.786 --> 00:05:45.686 A:middle
when the app looks
like it is installed.

00:05:45.686 --> 00:05:49.286 A:middle
So the experience for
the user is much better.

00:05:50.086 --> 00:05:53.296 A:middle
Second, because we are
occupying a smaller

00:05:53.296 --> 00:05:57.306 A:middle
and more manageable space on
device, the footprint of the app

00:05:57.306 --> 00:06:00.566 A:middle
at any one time, we can have
more apps on the device ready



00:05:57.306 --> 00:06:00.566 A:middle
at any one time, we can have
more apps on the device ready

00:06:00.566 --> 00:06:03.266 A:middle
to go and more apps ready
to go at any one time

00:06:03.266 --> 00:06:04.986 A:middle
on the device is always a
good thing for the user.

00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:09.326 A:middle
And finally, for the
user, because, again,

00:06:09.326 --> 00:06:11.986 A:middle
there is more space and we
are keeping a lot of the app

00:06:11.986 --> 00:06:16.806 A:middle
or the game in the cloud on the
App Store, we can have levels

00:06:16.846 --> 00:06:19.286 A:middle
that are richer and more
expansive, for example.

00:06:19.596 --> 00:06:22.286 A:middle
And that is always a good
thing for the user as well.

00:06:23.246 --> 00:06:27.816 A:middle
Okay. So now let's dive into
some of the details about ODR.

00:06:29.296 --> 00:06:31.906 A:middle
First of all, it's an
elementive app thinning in iOS 9

00:06:33.176 --> 00:06:35.766 A:middle
and it's well integrated
with app slicing.

00:06:36.006 --> 00:06:38.586 A:middle
In case you missed the
details of app slicing earlier

00:06:38.586 --> 00:06:40.496 A:middle
in the conference,
app slicing is all

00:06:40.496 --> 00:06:43.726 A:middle
about tailoring the download of
an app to a particular device.

00:06:44.406 --> 00:06:46.446 A:middle
So let me give you an
example: You write an app

00:06:46.606 --> 00:06:49.526 A:middle
that targets many different
iPhone sizes and iPads.

00:06:50.726 --> 00:06:53.246 A:middle
A user with an iPhone comes
along and when they buy

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.476 A:middle
that app, app slicing makes sure

00:06:55.476 --> 00:06:58.666 A:middle
that they only get the resources
you need for that phone.

00:06:59.546 --> 00:07:01.346 A:middle
In the past they
would have gotten all



00:06:59.546 --> 00:07:01.346 A:middle
In the past they
would have gotten all

00:07:01.346 --> 00:07:03.136 A:middle
of the assets including
those for an iPad.

00:07:03.916 --> 00:07:08.636 A:middle
So now when we combine app
slicing and we join it with ODR,

00:07:08.896 --> 00:07:10.456 A:middle
we double the benefits of both.

00:07:10.456 --> 00:07:12.306 A:middle
The footprint is
still even smaller.

00:07:12.736 --> 00:07:15.366 A:middle
We are getting to
first play even faster

00:07:15.666 --> 00:07:17.956 A:middle
and the constant
steady state of the app

00:07:18.266 --> 00:07:20.476 A:middle
on device is much smaller.

00:07:21.076 --> 00:07:26.966 A:middle
Okay. So what does
an ODR app look like?

00:07:26.966 --> 00:07:27.826 A:middle
How is it structured?

00:07:28.186 --> 00:07:32.686 A:middle
It's pretty similar to an
app today, but as you recall,

00:07:32.686 --> 00:07:35.926 A:middle
we teased apart the assets
for those levels in the game.

00:07:36.416 --> 00:07:37.806 A:middle
We call these asset packs.

00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:40.766 A:middle
And the rest of the app
remains your dot app.

00:07:41.986 --> 00:07:46.386 A:middle
Now, you group these together
using Xcode with simple tags.

00:07:46.386 --> 00:07:49.006 A:middle
For example, these are
all my assets in Level 1

00:07:49.076 --> 00:07:50.096 A:middle
of the game, for example.

00:07:50.266 --> 00:07:51.776 A:middle
It's pretty simple to set up.

00:07:52.016 --> 00:07:56.146 A:middle
And you can tag a single
file or a whole folder.

00:07:56.146 --> 00:07:58.606 A:middle
This whole folder is
Level 2, for example.

00:07:59.036 --> 00:07:59.786 A:middle
All right.



00:08:00.136 --> 00:08:01.786 A:middle
Now, what can you tag?

00:08:03.256 --> 00:08:05.476 A:middle
Well, pretty much anything
that can be in a dot app today.

00:08:06.386 --> 00:08:11.796 A:middle
For example, images,
sounds, data, scripts,

00:08:12.056 --> 00:08:13.456 A:middle
many games have scripts in them,

00:08:13.886 --> 00:08:17.076 A:middle
you can also have
in-app purchased content.

00:08:17.076 --> 00:08:19.916 A:middle
So now you can tie together
your in-app purchased receipts

00:08:20.376 --> 00:08:21.966 A:middle
with in-app purchased content

00:08:21.966 --> 00:08:24.376 A:middle
that you are actually
downloading via ODR,

00:08:24.376 --> 00:08:26.536 A:middle
and taking advantage of
all the other ODR API

00:08:26.536 --> 00:08:27.446 A:middle
to help manage that.

00:08:28.426 --> 00:08:31.246 A:middle
The only thing you can't have
is executable content: That's,

00:08:31.246 --> 00:08:34.306 A:middle
again, the compiled
Swift, Objective-C, C, C++.

00:08:34.586 --> 00:08:36.926 A:middle
Leave that in your dot app.

00:08:37.086 --> 00:08:37.816 A:middle
All right.

00:08:38.826 --> 00:08:41.796 A:middle
So where is this content hosted?

00:08:42.385 --> 00:08:43.846 A:middle
Well, I mentioned
one of the locations;

00:08:43.846 --> 00:08:44.926 A:middle
it's obviously the App Store.

00:08:46.216 --> 00:08:48.766 A:middle
We host it in the App Store and
we serve it on demand as needed,

00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:52.666 A:middle
but during development, Xcode
stands in for the App Store,

00:08:52.816 --> 00:08:53.666 A:middle
whether you are developing

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:55.446 A:middle
against a device
or the simulator.

00:08:55.886 --> 00:08:59.216 A:middle
And it hosts it to your app
and delivers it on demand.



00:09:00.056 --> 00:09:03.006 A:middle
Now, another tool in the Xcode
tool box is the Xcode Server.

00:09:03.496 --> 00:09:05.256 A:middle
You can set this up in
your own department,

00:09:05.956 --> 00:09:09.086 A:middle
such that the app along with
the ODR content is available

00:09:09.086 --> 00:09:10.746 A:middle
on that server, for example,

00:09:10.746 --> 00:09:13.946 A:middle
your Q/A engineering
group to test your app.

00:09:14.916 --> 00:09:16.406 A:middle
And as you might expect,

00:09:16.566 --> 00:09:18.526 A:middle
TestFlight is fully
integrated with ODR.

00:09:20.036 --> 00:09:21.766 A:middle
And finally, if you
are deploying an app

00:09:21.766 --> 00:09:24.796 A:middle
into Enterprise, you can
actually host ODR content

00:09:24.796 --> 00:09:27.886 A:middle
on a web server inside of your
enterprise including behind a

00:09:27.886 --> 00:09:31.006 A:middle
secure login so that not just
anyone can get at that content.

00:09:32.296 --> 00:09:34.156 A:middle
So that's where we
host ODR content.

00:09:34.676 --> 00:09:36.056 A:middle
All right.

00:09:36.836 --> 00:09:38.126 A:middle
So how do you get started?

00:09:38.786 --> 00:09:40.296 A:middle
Well, as a developer,
the first thing you need

00:09:40.296 --> 00:09:43.896 A:middle
to do is take a look at all the
many assets you have in your app

00:09:43.896 --> 00:09:45.546 A:middle
and start to identify them.

00:09:45.546 --> 00:09:46.946 A:middle
You need to categorize them.

00:09:47.826 --> 00:09:50.566 A:middle
You use this, again, by tagging
them with simple strings.

00:09:51.016 --> 00:09:53.146 A:middle
These are all of the assets
that are in Level 1 of my game.

00:09:53.786 --> 00:09:55.696 A:middle
These are the assets
for Level 2 of my game.

00:09:55.936 --> 00:09:58.266 A:middle
And you know, there are some
shared assets between levels?

00:09:59.286 --> 00:09:59.746 A:middle
There they are.

00:09:59.746 --> 00:10:03.276 A:middle
So you can tag assets with
multiple tags in order



00:09:59.746 --> 00:10:03.276 A:middle
So you can tag assets with
multiple tags in order

00:10:03.276 --> 00:10:06.216 A:middle
to indicate the sharing
and avoid duplication.

00:10:07.046 --> 00:10:10.426 A:middle
So this is part one of
getting ready to use ODR

00:10:10.426 --> 00:10:11.916 A:middle
and that was your
job as a developer.

00:10:12.256 --> 00:10:15.386 A:middle
Now, Xcode does its job because
it takes all this tagging

00:10:15.736 --> 00:10:17.946 A:middle
and groups these
into asset packs.

00:10:18.086 --> 00:10:20.756 A:middle
In this case, we ended up
with three asset packs.

00:10:21.656 --> 00:10:25.356 A:middle
We have the asset pack for Level
1, the asset pack for Level 2,

00:10:25.656 --> 00:10:27.676 A:middle
and we ended up with
a third asset pack

00:10:27.676 --> 00:10:30.116 A:middle
which is the shared assets
between those two levels,

00:10:30.716 --> 00:10:32.266 A:middle
again, avoiding duplication.

00:10:33.776 --> 00:10:36.206 A:middle
Okay. So Xcode has done its job.

00:10:36.206 --> 00:10:37.716 A:middle
Now, it's back to
you, the developer.

00:10:39.026 --> 00:10:39.956 A:middle
The first thing you need

00:10:39.956 --> 00:10:42.306 A:middle
to do is basically just
request the resources: Hey,

00:10:42.606 --> 00:10:44.456 A:middle
I need everything for Level 1,

00:10:45.036 --> 00:10:48.406 A:middle
and down come the two asset
packs, both the dedicated one

00:10:48.516 --> 00:10:51.476 A:middle
to Level 1, and then the
one that was sharing assets

00:10:51.476 --> 00:10:52.736 A:middle
between Level 1 and Level 2.

00:10:52.816 --> 00:10:55.386 A:middle
And because we brought down
that shared asset pack,

00:10:55.896 --> 00:10:58.706 A:middle
when we request Level
2, we get those assets

00:10:59.276 --> 00:11:01.416 A:middle
and we already have the
shared assets on the device.



00:10:59.276 --> 00:11:01.416 A:middle
and we already have the
shared assets on the device.

00:11:02.686 --> 00:11:07.326 A:middle
So this is a high level overview
of what ODR is all about as well

00:11:07.326 --> 00:11:09.146 A:middle
as how to build an
ODR application.

00:11:09.146 --> 00:11:10.956 A:middle
Now, I would like to
invite on stage Tony Parker

00:11:11.256 --> 00:11:13.516 A:middle
to show us how it's done
in Xcode with a real API.

00:11:13.896 --> 00:11:14.146 A:middle
Tony.

00:11:15.516 --> 00:11:20.086 A:middle
[Applause]

00:11:20.586 --> 00:11:21.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TONY PARKER: Thanks, Steve.

00:11:21.956 --> 00:11:23.626 A:middle
So, again, my name is Tony
Parker, I'm the manager

00:11:23.626 --> 00:11:24.796 A:middle
of the Foundation team at Apple.

00:11:25.426 --> 00:11:26.976 A:middle
So Steve gave you
a basic overview

00:11:26.976 --> 00:11:28.656 A:middle
of how the ODR system works.

00:11:29.046 --> 00:11:31.196 A:middle
Now we are going to dive
in to the API that we use

00:11:31.196 --> 00:11:33.606 A:middle
in your application to
actually make those requests.

00:11:34.296 --> 00:11:37.516 A:middle
There is really just one piece
of API that you need to know.

00:11:37.616 --> 00:11:41.206 A:middle
It's a new class in Foundation
called NSBundleResourceRequest.

00:11:41.686 --> 00:11:45.346 A:middle
This class follows the
command design pattern.

00:11:45.596 --> 00:11:47.066 A:middle
So what that means is
you're going to set up one

00:11:47.066 --> 00:11:48.506 A:middle
of these objects with
a set of options,

00:11:49.096 --> 00:11:51.186 A:middle
including of course the set of
tags that you are interested

00:11:51.186 --> 00:11:54.066 A:middle
in using, and then you tell
it to begin its request.

00:11:54.626 --> 00:11:58.666 A:middle
So you can create as many of
these objects as you need.

00:11:58.726 --> 00:12:00.866 A:middle
That's because the system
will ref count the tags



00:11:58.726 --> 00:12:00.866 A:middle
That's because the system
will ref count the tags

00:12:00.866 --> 00:12:01.466 A:middle
under the hood.

00:12:01.466 --> 00:12:04.006 A:middle
So if you have several different
parts of your application

00:12:04.006 --> 00:12:08.206 A:middle
that use ODR and perhaps use
overlapping tags, you don't need

00:12:08.206 --> 00:12:10.016 A:middle
to create a manager
class to keep track

00:12:10.016 --> 00:12:11.846 A:middle
of which ones you
have in use at a time.

00:12:11.846 --> 00:12:13.186 A:middle
We will go ahead
and do that for you.

00:12:15.656 --> 00:12:19.156 A:middle
The most important point,
design point about this class is

00:12:19.156 --> 00:12:21.016 A:middle
that the request is decoupled

00:12:21.016 --> 00:12:23.076 A:middle
from the actual use
of the resources.

00:12:23.766 --> 00:12:26.666 A:middle
What this means is that all
of the APIs that you use today

00:12:26.666 --> 00:12:28.426 A:middle
in your application and
you are already familiar

00:12:28.426 --> 00:12:31.186 A:middle
with like NSBundle's
URLForResource,

00:12:31.456 --> 00:12:35.546 A:middle
NSData's dataWithContentsOfURL
or UIImage imageNamed,

00:12:36.116 --> 00:12:38.316 A:middle
all of those APIs
remain actually as is.

00:12:38.796 --> 00:12:41.056 A:middle
You just need to tell the
system in advance using one

00:12:41.056 --> 00:12:43.076 A:middle
of these request objects
that you are going

00:12:43.076 --> 00:12:44.626 A:middle
to need those resources
to be present.

00:12:47.416 --> 00:12:49.476 A:middle
This object forms a very
simple state machine.

00:12:49.726 --> 00:12:51.276 A:middle
So start off in init.

00:12:52.286 --> 00:12:53.916 A:middle
We move it to this
requested state

00:12:53.916 --> 00:12:56.066 A:middle
when we anticipate the
need for those resources.

00:12:56.686 --> 00:12:59.926 A:middle
And we're going to get back
a completion handler callback

00:12:59.926 --> 00:13:02.506 A:middle
which will tell us either the
resources are now available



00:12:59.926 --> 00:13:02.506 A:middle
which will tell us either the
resources are now available

00:13:02.506 --> 00:13:05.846 A:middle
for you to use and you can
continue to use those APIs

00:13:05.846 --> 00:13:08.906 A:middle
that we just discussed,
or an error occurred.

00:13:09.166 --> 00:13:11.816 A:middle
Now, of course, when you are
using ODR there are a few errors

00:13:11.816 --> 00:13:14.046 A:middle
that can occur that we may
need to present to the user.

00:13:14.366 --> 00:13:16.796 A:middle
That could include, perhaps,
there is no network available

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.196 A:middle
and we need it to
download the content,

00:13:18.566 --> 00:13:20.796 A:middle
or maybe there is not enough
disk space on the device even

00:13:20.796 --> 00:13:23.176 A:middle
after we tried purging
to hold the content.

00:13:23.616 --> 00:13:25.916 A:middle
So in any case, you need to
present that to the user.

00:13:25.976 --> 00:13:27.856 A:middle
Perhaps there is something they
can do to resolve the issue.

00:13:28.336 --> 00:13:31.646 A:middle
So if the resources were
available, then, as I said,

00:13:31.646 --> 00:13:34.936 A:middle
you can continue to use
them, and also important,

00:13:34.936 --> 00:13:37.266 A:middle
when you are done with those
resources, please tell us

00:13:37.266 --> 00:13:39.616 A:middle
about it, and there are
two mechanisms to do that.

00:13:39.976 --> 00:13:42.836 A:middle
The first is to call an
explicit API on this class

00:13:43.246 --> 00:13:45.236 A:middle
that tells us you are
finished with the content.

00:13:46.016 --> 00:13:48.546 A:middle
The second is to allow the
class to be deallocated,

00:13:48.546 --> 00:13:49.876 A:middle
allow the object
to be deallocated,

00:13:49.876 --> 00:13:51.876 A:middle
in which case we are
going to go ahead

00:13:51.876 --> 00:13:54.166 A:middle
and end the request
on your behalf.

00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:58.026 A:middle
So here is what the
basic methods look like.

00:13:58.616 --> 00:14:01.526 A:middle
First, an initializer, and
you can see it takes a set



00:13:58.616 --> 00:14:01.526 A:middle
First, an initializer, and
you can see it takes a set

00:14:01.526 --> 00:14:02.096 A:middle
of strings.

00:14:02.206 --> 00:14:04.316 A:middle
Those are the tags that you
are interested in requesting.

00:14:05.516 --> 00:14:07.736 A:middle
The method to begin
the request is called

00:14:07.736 --> 00:14:09.996 A:middle
beginAccessingResources
WithCompletionHander,

00:14:09.996 --> 00:14:11.536 A:middle
and you can see there's
the closure

00:14:11.536 --> 00:14:13.816 A:middle
that has the NSError argument.

00:14:15.176 --> 00:14:16.306 A:middle
And finally that method

00:14:16.306 --> 00:14:17.706 A:middle
that tells the system
you are finished,

00:14:18.016 --> 00:14:20.186 A:middle
the explicit
endAccessingResources call.

00:14:22.306 --> 00:14:24.796 A:middle
So next I would like to go
into a demo and show you some

00:14:24.796 --> 00:14:25.776 A:middle
of this API in action.

00:14:25.776 --> 00:14:26.426 A:middle
All right.

00:14:34.116 --> 00:14:38.586 A:middle
So here you have our demo app
today, it's called iTravel,

00:14:38.996 --> 00:14:41.866 A:middle
and iTravel is called iTravel
because it's a travel guide

00:14:42.226 --> 00:14:44.576 A:middle
that gives you all kinds
interesting information

00:14:44.576 --> 00:14:48.376 A:middle
about countries whose names
begin with the letter I.

00:14:48.376 --> 00:14:50.446 A:middle
As you can see, we support
two countries today:

00:14:50.736 --> 00:14:52.446 A:middle
There's Iceland and Italy.

00:14:53.006 --> 00:14:54.896 A:middle
Now, this kind of application
is a great candidate

00:14:54.896 --> 00:14:56.626 A:middle
for adopting On Demand
Resources.

00:14:56.666 --> 00:14:58.606 A:middle
And that is, the reason is

00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:00.226 A:middle
because when the
user buys this app,



00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:00.226 A:middle
because when the
user buys this app,

00:15:00.546 --> 00:15:03.186 A:middle
they are maybe not interested
in getting all the information

00:15:03.186 --> 00:15:06.226 A:middle
about both Iceland and
Italy or at least not both

00:15:06.226 --> 00:15:09.596 A:middle
at the same time so we
can make the install size

00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:12.226 A:middle
and the download size much
smaller by downloading

00:15:12.226 --> 00:15:13.466 A:middle
that content on demand.

00:15:14.136 --> 00:15:15.746 A:middle
So before we adopt
ODR I just want

00:15:15.746 --> 00:15:18.076 A:middle
to show you a brief
example of how you use this.

00:15:18.446 --> 00:15:20.426 A:middle
First I will go ahead
and visit Iceland.

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:24.596 A:middle
You can see that I get a list
here of points of interest.

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:26.786 A:middle
So I can pick one of these

00:15:27.216 --> 00:15:29.626 A:middle
and there is some high
quality pictures, perhaps,

00:15:29.626 --> 00:15:32.086 A:middle
or guide text, and
each of these points

00:15:32.086 --> 00:15:34.136 A:middle
of interest has more pictures.

00:15:34.536 --> 00:15:39.436 A:middle
So you can see that this could
add up to quite a bit of data.

00:15:39.576 --> 00:15:41.676 A:middle
And Italy, of course,
behaves the same way,

00:15:42.026 --> 00:15:43.896 A:middle
but with a different
set of content.

00:15:44.386 --> 00:15:48.356 A:middle
So let's look at how this
application is built.

00:15:48.356 --> 00:15:53.186 A:middle
We are going to spend
most of our time today

00:15:53.186 --> 00:15:56.156 A:middle
in just one class, it's called
the AlbumTableViewController.

00:15:56.156 --> 00:15:58.976 A:middle
This is the view controller
that controls this view

00:15:58.976 --> 00:16:01.346 A:middle
that we see right here with
the list of points of interest.



00:15:58.976 --> 00:16:01.346 A:middle
that we see right here with
the list of points of interest.

00:16:02.066 --> 00:16:03.286 A:middle
So let me show you how it works.

00:16:04.486 --> 00:16:07.056 A:middle
When we segue into
this view, we are going

00:16:07.056 --> 00:16:09.656 A:middle
to have this function
called loadAlbum,

00:16:09.656 --> 00:16:11.716 A:middle
and the argument is going to be
which album we are interested

00:16:11.716 --> 00:16:13.526 A:middle
in looking at, either
Italy or Iceland.

00:16:14.856 --> 00:16:17.116 A:middle
We set our title and we
call this helper function

00:16:17.116 --> 00:16:18.416 A:middle
called populateTable.

00:16:19.136 --> 00:16:21.456 A:middle
Now, here in the populateTable
function, we are going

00:16:21.456 --> 00:16:25.936 A:middle
to use NSBundle's URLForResource
to find a JSON file

00:16:25.936 --> 00:16:28.216 A:middle
which describes all of the
points of interest with pictures

00:16:28.216 --> 00:16:29.696 A:middle
to show what the captions are.

00:16:29.696 --> 00:16:33.006 A:middle
We are using NSData's
contentsOfURL method

00:16:33.006 --> 00:16:35.026 A:middle
to actually read that
JSON file from disk.

00:16:35.026 --> 00:16:38.156 A:middle
We are using NSJSONSerialization
to parse it.

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:40.476 A:middle
We are setting up some more
detailed label text here,

00:16:40.716 --> 00:16:42.676 A:middle
and finally we ask the
tableView to reload itself,

00:16:43.056 --> 00:16:43.856 A:middle
and the data source

00:16:43.856 --> 00:16:47.246 A:middle
in the tableView is
using UIImage.imageNamed

00:16:47.386 --> 00:16:49.426 A:middle
to actually show that,
to fetch that picture.

00:16:49.986 --> 00:16:54.246 A:middle
So the important point here
is that as we adopt ODR

00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:55.926 A:middle
in this application, nothing

00:16:55.926 --> 00:16:57.916 A:middle
in this populateTable
function has to change.

00:16:58.446 --> 00:17:00.766 A:middle
So, again, all of the
APIs that you use today



00:16:58.446 --> 00:17:00.766 A:middle
So, again, all of the
APIs that you use today

00:17:00.766 --> 00:17:04.536 A:middle
that access contents of files
on disk or finds those files

00:17:04.536 --> 00:17:07.386 A:middle
like NSBundles, those
remain exactly the same.

00:17:07.965 --> 00:17:10.316 A:middle
So the first thing we are going

00:17:10.316 --> 00:17:12.656 A:middle
to do is actually add some
tags to our application.

00:17:13.006 --> 00:17:16.086 A:middle
So to do that, I will bring
up the inspector here,

00:17:16.806 --> 00:17:19.536 A:middle
and you can see that I have
already organized my application

00:17:19.536 --> 00:17:22.036 A:middle
to have a group called
Resources,

00:17:22.396 --> 00:17:25.195 A:middle
and folders that contain
some of my content.

00:17:25.346 --> 00:17:29.126 A:middle
So this one contains all of the
picture from Iceland, this one,

00:17:29.126 --> 00:17:32.986 A:middle
all of the pictures from
Italy, and these JSON files

00:17:32.986 --> 00:17:33.756 A:middle
that I was discussing.

00:17:33.756 --> 00:17:36.786 A:middle
So what I'm going
to do is go ahead

00:17:36.786 --> 00:17:40.676 A:middle
and select both the JSON file
for Iceland and the folder

00:17:41.206 --> 00:17:43.706 A:middle
and look on the right side
here in this inspector.

00:17:43.706 --> 00:17:46.566 A:middle
You see there is a new field,
On Demand Resource Tags,

00:17:47.376 --> 00:17:49.206 A:middle
so all I have to do
here is start typing

00:17:49.406 --> 00:17:52.406 A:middle
and we will tag our
content as Iceland.

00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:55.446 A:middle
And we will do the same
for our Italy content.

00:17:56.156 --> 00:18:02.836 A:middle
So next we just, so that,
what that does is, of course,



00:17:56.156 --> 00:18:02.836 A:middle
So next we just, so that,
what that does is, of course,

00:18:02.836 --> 00:18:05.736 A:middle
as Steve explained, tell Xcode
how to split up your content.

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:09.276 A:middle
Now, the next part is to
tell the system at runtime

00:18:09.576 --> 00:18:11.606 A:middle
that when we anticipate the need

00:18:11.606 --> 00:18:12.936 A:middle
for that content
to be available.

00:18:12.936 --> 00:18:15.286 A:middle
So we will do that here
in this view controller.

00:18:15.286 --> 00:18:18.906 A:middle
So the first thing I'm going to
do is add an I var to my class

00:18:18.956 --> 00:18:21.176 A:middle
that holds the class that
we've been talking about,

00:18:21.176 --> 00:18:22.366 A:middle
NSBundleResourceRequest.

00:18:22.996 --> 00:18:24.986 A:middle
So what I'm doing is
taking advantage of the fact

00:18:24.986 --> 00:18:27.016 A:middle
that when this view
controller is torn down,

00:18:27.456 --> 00:18:30.206 A:middle
we maintain pretty tight
control over this object.

00:18:30.206 --> 00:18:33.316 A:middle
So we can control its lifetime
so when it's torn down we know

00:18:33.316 --> 00:18:34.386 A:middle
that we are done
with the request

00:18:34.386 --> 00:18:36.686 A:middle
and we can allow the
system to deallocate it

00:18:36.686 --> 00:18:39.366 A:middle
and that will tell the system
we are done with the content.

00:18:39.766 --> 00:18:44.266 A:middle
Next in our loadAlbum function
before we call populate table,

00:18:44.266 --> 00:18:47.516 A:middle
we are going to create the
request, we are passing

00:18:47.516 --> 00:18:50.216 A:middle
in the set of tags, in this
case it's a set of one tag

00:18:50.246 --> 00:18:51.856 A:middle
which is either Italy
or Iceland.

00:18:52.416 --> 00:18:56.136 A:middle
We call beginAccessingResources
WithCompletionHandler (without

00:18:56.306 --> 00:18:57.876 A:middle
space), and when
we get a result,

00:18:58.026 --> 00:19:01.806 A:middle
this closure will be called,
and it may have an error.



00:18:58.026 --> 00:19:01.806 A:middle
this closure will be called,
and it may have an error.

00:19:02.156 --> 00:19:04.796 A:middle
So on the main thread, because
this completion handler will be

00:19:04.796 --> 00:19:07.666 A:middle
called on a non-main thread,
we are going to first check

00:19:07.666 --> 00:19:08.946 A:middle
to make sure that
the error is nil.

00:19:09.326 --> 00:19:11.226 A:middle
If it's non-nil, then
an error occurred

00:19:11.226 --> 00:19:13.406 A:middle
and as we discussed it's
important to present

00:19:13.406 --> 00:19:15.686 A:middle
that to the user, which I'm
doing in a helper function here.

00:19:16.616 --> 00:19:18.996 A:middle
Then we call the exact
same populateTable function

00:19:19.266 --> 00:19:20.476 A:middle
that we just went through.

00:19:20.666 --> 00:19:22.016 A:middle
So, again, nothing
in there changed.

00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:24.286 A:middle
Let's go ahead and run
the application again

00:19:24.286 --> 00:19:25.806 A:middle
and see how this looks.

00:19:29.636 --> 00:19:33.016 A:middle
So now, I'm going to visit
Iceland and we will see

00:19:33.016 --> 00:19:36.696 A:middle
that my content is here because
we have made a request for it,

00:19:36.696 --> 00:19:39.676 A:middle
and I can choose some of these
pictures or points of interest,

00:19:40.036 --> 00:19:42.196 A:middle
and all of my content
is available just

00:19:42.196 --> 00:19:44.146 A:middle
as if it had been part of the
application from the start.

00:19:44.146 --> 00:19:46.166 A:middle
Now, this is a good opportunity

00:19:46.166 --> 00:19:48.186 A:middle
to show you a new
debugging feature in Xcode

00:19:48.186 --> 00:19:49.746 A:middle
that can really help
you to understand

00:19:49.996 --> 00:19:51.816 A:middle
if you are using
these request objects

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:52.826 A:middle
in the way you think you are.

00:19:52.826 --> 00:19:54.956 A:middle
And that's a new debug gauge.

00:19:55.766 --> 00:19:56.366 A:middle
So I'm going to bring

00:19:56.366 --> 00:19:58.766 A:middle
up the debug gauge view
here and choose disk.

00:19:59.296 --> 00:20:01.676 A:middle
And you'll notice in the middle
we have a new section called



00:19:59.296 --> 00:20:01.676 A:middle
And you'll notice in the middle
we have a new section called

00:20:02.106 --> 00:20:03.136 A:middle
On Demand Resources.

00:20:03.616 --> 00:20:05.886 A:middle
It lists all of the tags that
are part of your application,

00:20:06.746 --> 00:20:10.776 A:middle
so Iceland and Italy, their
size and their current status.

00:20:11.196 --> 00:20:13.696 A:middle
You notice that Iceland
is listed as in use,

00:20:13.996 --> 00:20:15.666 A:middle
and that makes sense
because we are looking

00:20:15.666 --> 00:20:18.496 A:middle
at the Iceland content right
here and it remains in use

00:20:18.496 --> 00:20:19.886 A:middle
as I view some of
these pictures.

00:20:20.326 --> 00:20:21.826 A:middle
But if I go back
to the main table

00:20:21.826 --> 00:20:24.446 A:middle
of contents its status
is changed from in use

00:20:24.446 --> 00:20:26.696 A:middle
to downloaded, and
that's because again

00:20:26.696 --> 00:20:28.366 A:middle
that request object
was deallocated

00:20:28.556 --> 00:20:31.456 A:middle
and the system now knows we are
no longer using that content.

00:20:31.916 --> 00:20:35.726 A:middle
We didn't delete it off disk
immediately so if you go back

00:20:35.726 --> 00:20:37.756 A:middle
to Iceland the content
is available again

00:20:38.016 --> 00:20:40.036 A:middle
and the status changes
back to in use.

00:20:40.036 --> 00:20:42.856 A:middle
Let's see what happens
if I visit Italy now.

00:20:42.856 --> 00:20:45.896 A:middle
Now, you notice that it's going

00:20:45.896 --> 00:20:48.966 A:middle
to take some time to
show this content.

00:20:49.436 --> 00:20:52.856 A:middle
And the reason for
that is that the size

00:20:52.856 --> 00:20:55.796 A:middle
of the Italy tag is actually
much larger than the one

00:20:55.796 --> 00:20:57.686 A:middle
for Iceland; it's
130 megabytes here.

00:20:58.386 --> 00:21:00.986 A:middle
Now, there are two things
that are important to do here.



00:20:58.386 --> 00:21:00.986 A:middle
Now, there are two things
that are important to do here.

00:21:01.226 --> 00:21:05.856 A:middle
The first is to actually reduce
the size of the tagged content,

00:21:05.856 --> 00:21:08.576 A:middle
split it up into smaller
chunks, and we are going to go

00:21:08.576 --> 00:21:10.776 A:middle
into some more detail on the
best practices for that later,

00:21:11.316 --> 00:21:12.956 A:middle
but for now, what I want

00:21:12.956 --> 00:21:15.286 A:middle
to do is show you how you
can adopt progress reporting

00:21:15.386 --> 00:21:18.106 A:middle
in your application
in conjunction

00:21:18.106 --> 00:21:20.266 A:middle
with NSBundleResourceRequest
so that

00:21:20.266 --> 00:21:22.546 A:middle
when you are downloading
this content you can display

00:21:22.546 --> 00:21:25.406 A:middle
something to the user so they
understand what's going on.

00:21:25.406 --> 00:21:32.146 A:middle
So let's go back to our
AlbumTableViewController class.

00:21:32.596 --> 00:21:37.816 A:middle
So what we are going
to do is take advantage

00:21:37.816 --> 00:21:40.806 A:middle
of NSBundleResourceRequest
support for NSProgress,

00:21:40.806 --> 00:21:44.056 A:middle
which is a foundation class
you can use to report progress

00:21:44.056 --> 00:21:47.216 A:middle
and compose progress
across your application.

00:21:48.486 --> 00:21:51.866 A:middle
NSProgress supports key value
observing, so what we're going

00:21:51.866 --> 00:21:54.526 A:middle
to do is add this view
controller as an observer

00:21:54.526 --> 00:21:58.886 A:middle
of the progress and in response
to updates, change some UI

00:21:58.886 --> 00:22:00.486 A:middle
on the screen, a
UI progress view,



00:21:58.886 --> 00:22:00.486 A:middle
on the screen, a
UI progress view,

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:01.926 A:middle
and some detail label text.

00:22:02.916 --> 00:22:06.366 A:middle
So right here after
we create the request,

00:22:06.526 --> 00:22:08.716 A:middle
we are going to call
addObserver.

00:22:09.146 --> 00:22:10.376 A:middle
This class will be the observer.

00:22:10.376 --> 00:22:12.126 A:middle
The progress property

00:22:12.126 --> 00:22:14.576 A:middle
of the request is the
object we are observing.

00:22:15.606 --> 00:22:18.296 A:middle
The key path of the progress
is fractionCompleted.

00:22:18.906 --> 00:22:21.396 A:middle
And as always when
using KVO it's important

00:22:21.396 --> 00:22:23.256 A:middle
to specify a unique
context pointer

00:22:23.616 --> 00:22:25.076 A:middle
which I have defined
elsewhere in this file.

00:22:26.016 --> 00:22:29.366 A:middle
Also, we are going to go ahead
and unhide a UI progressView

00:22:29.546 --> 00:22:31.596 A:middle
that I have already hooked
up in our storyboard.

00:22:32.246 --> 00:22:36.766 A:middle
When we get our response, that's
a great time to removeObserver

00:22:36.856 --> 00:22:39.096 A:middle
because after that point
we are no longer interested

00:22:39.096 --> 00:22:40.596 A:middle
in updates to the progress.

00:22:41.426 --> 00:22:45.376 A:middle
And then on the main thread we
are also going to unhide the --

00:22:45.376 --> 00:22:47.516 A:middle
sorry, rehide the
UI progressView

00:22:47.516 --> 00:22:49.026 A:middle
because we don't want
our user to be staring

00:22:49.026 --> 00:22:50.126 A:middle
at complete progress bars.

00:22:50.536 --> 00:22:53.336 A:middle
So that adds ourselves
as an observer

00:22:53.686 --> 00:22:56.566 A:middle
and then the second part of
this is to actually do something

00:22:56.566 --> 00:22:58.246 A:middle
when the value changes,

00:22:58.246 --> 00:23:00.486 A:middle
and we do that in the
traditional KVO method,



00:22:58.246 --> 00:23:00.486 A:middle
and we do that in the
traditional KVO method,

00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:02.066 A:middle
observeValueForKeyPath.

00:23:02.706 --> 00:23:04.186 A:middle
So here we are first
checking to make sure

00:23:04.186 --> 00:23:07.106 A:middle
that this is the update that
we are interested in observing

00:23:07.106 --> 00:23:09.356 A:middle
by checking the context
pointer and the key path,

00:23:10.046 --> 00:23:13.216 A:middle
and on the main thread, again,
because this update will come

00:23:13.216 --> 00:23:14.956 A:middle
on a non-main thread,
we are going

00:23:14.956 --> 00:23:18.396 A:middle
to update our UI progressView by
setting its progress property,

00:23:18.866 --> 00:23:20.176 A:middle
and we are going
to take advantage

00:23:20.176 --> 00:23:24.596 A:middle
of NSProgress's support for an
automatic localized description

00:23:24.596 --> 00:23:26.476 A:middle
by using its
localizedDescription method.

00:23:27.006 --> 00:23:30.526 A:middle
Let's go ahead and run this
again and see how that works.

00:23:36.196 --> 00:23:39.036 A:middle
So this time when I visit
Italy, you will notice

00:23:39.036 --> 00:23:41.546 A:middle
that at the bottom our detail
label text has been updated

00:23:41.546 --> 00:23:45.396 A:middle
to show a percent completed, and
then as the download completes,

00:23:45.396 --> 00:23:48.196 A:middle
our UI progress view is
updated to show the user

00:23:48.196 --> 00:23:49.086 A:middle
that something has happened.

00:23:50.156 --> 00:23:52.696 A:middle
Also, again, we didn't
delete the content eagerly

00:23:52.696 --> 00:23:54.566 A:middle
so if we go back and
visit Italy again,

00:23:54.836 --> 00:23:56.746 A:middle
you notice that the content
is immediately available

00:23:57.286 --> 00:24:00.216 A:middle
because it's been cached by
the On Demand Resources system.



00:23:57.286 --> 00:24:00.216 A:middle
because it's been cached by
the On Demand Resources system.

00:24:00.746 --> 00:24:03.026 A:middle
Let's go back to our slides.

00:24:04.386 --> 00:24:13.106 A:middle
So a few more things about
the progress reporting part

00:24:13.106 --> 00:24:13.666 A:middle
of that demo.

00:24:14.126 --> 00:24:16.136 A:middle
So, again, you can find
information on the progress

00:24:16.136 --> 00:24:18.806 A:middle
of the request by looking
at the progress property.

00:24:19.846 --> 00:24:22.276 A:middle
We also support cancellation,
pausing, and resuming

00:24:22.276 --> 00:24:24.406 A:middle
of the request, and those
are methods you will find

00:24:24.406 --> 00:24:27.286 A:middle
on the NSProgress property,
not the request itself.

00:24:29.256 --> 00:24:33.256 A:middle
Now, actually in iOS 9 and
OS X 10.11 we have made a lot

00:24:33.256 --> 00:24:34.376 A:middle
of really great improvements

00:24:34.436 --> 00:24:36.536 A:middle
to the NSProgress
class in Foundation.

00:24:37.066 --> 00:24:40.266 A:middle
So to learn more about how to
use it, how to incorporate it

00:24:40.266 --> 00:24:42.626 A:middle
from this class and from
elsewhere into your application

00:24:42.936 --> 00:24:44.926 A:middle
in a great way, I really
recommend you check

00:24:44.926 --> 00:24:47.606 A:middle
out this talk on
Friday, Best Practices

00:24:47.606 --> 00:24:48.476 A:middle
for Progress Reporting.

00:24:49.086 --> 00:24:54.326 A:middle
So the beginAccessing method
that we used goes ahead

00:24:54.326 --> 00:24:56.946 A:middle
and downloads content if
it's not already available.

00:24:57.366 --> 00:24:59.686 A:middle
However, sometimes you may
want to only use the content

00:24:59.686 --> 00:25:01.076 A:middle
if it's already available
on disk



00:24:59.686 --> 00:25:01.076 A:middle
if it's already available
on disk

00:25:01.076 --> 00:25:03.036 A:middle
without triggering a
download and you can do

00:25:03.036 --> 00:25:05.026 A:middle
that using what we call
a conditional request.

00:25:05.916 --> 00:25:06.766 A:middle
Here's the method:

00:25:06.826 --> 00:25:09.516 A:middle
conditionallyBeginAccessing
ResourcesWithCompletionHandler

00:25:09.576 --> 00:25:10.936 A:middle
(without space), and you can see

00:25:10.936 --> 00:25:13.116 A:middle
that the closure here
has a Boolean argument,

00:25:13.116 --> 00:25:14.766 A:middle
so the answer is
either yes or no,

00:25:14.896 --> 00:25:17.166 A:middle
depending on whether the content
is already available or not.

00:25:18.026 --> 00:25:22.716 A:middle
So in the view of our state
machine, we start off in init,

00:25:23.316 --> 00:25:25.416 A:middle
we move to this conditionally
requested state

00:25:25.416 --> 00:25:26.486 A:middle
by invoking this method.

00:25:26.486 --> 00:25:29.676 A:middle
You will get your response,
either it's available or not.

00:25:29.896 --> 00:25:32.566 A:middle
If it's available, then
the resources are available

00:25:32.566 --> 00:25:34.166 A:middle
to you just as if you had
called the other method.

00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:36.606 A:middle
So, again, be sure to
call endAccessingResources

00:25:36.876 --> 00:25:38.286 A:middle
or allow the object
to be deallocated.

00:25:38.286 --> 00:25:40.996 A:middle
If it wasn't available, at
that point you have a choice:

00:25:40.996 --> 00:25:43.676 A:middle
You can either do nothing

00:25:43.766 --> 00:25:46.066 A:middle
or you can call the
beginAccessingResources method

00:25:46.066 --> 00:25:47.766 A:middle
to cause that download
to happen.

00:25:48.316 --> 00:25:53.786 A:middle
And finally, there are two kinds
of priority APIs on this class

00:25:53.786 --> 00:25:54.676 A:middle
that I want to talk about.

00:25:55.106 --> 00:25:56.766 A:middle
The first is called
a loading priority.

00:25:56.766 --> 00:25:59.736 A:middle
This is a double, and
it provides ordering

00:25:59.736 --> 00:26:02.156 A:middle
for the outstanding
requests in your application.



00:25:59.736 --> 00:26:02.156 A:middle
for the outstanding
requests in your application.

00:26:02.656 --> 00:26:04.056 A:middle
The value ranges from 0 to 1.

00:26:04.346 --> 00:26:06.896 A:middle
So a value of 1 is
the highest priority

00:26:06.896 --> 00:26:08.486 A:middle
and the value of
0 is the lowest.

00:26:08.486 --> 00:26:12.316 A:middle
What we do with these values
is provide a hint to the system

00:26:12.376 --> 00:26:15.696 A:middle
about which outstanding request
should be prioritized first.

00:26:16.176 --> 00:26:19.226 A:middle
So because the value is not
compared across applications

00:26:19.226 --> 00:26:21.406 A:middle
on the system, but
only within your app,

00:26:21.626 --> 00:26:23.356 A:middle
you can use these
values as you choose

00:26:23.356 --> 00:26:25.926 A:middle
to help order the requests
according to your needs.

00:26:26.476 --> 00:26:29.526 A:middle
We do have a constant that
you can use here actually;

00:26:29.526 --> 00:26:33.636 A:middle
it's called loading priority
urgent, and this is for the case

00:26:33.636 --> 00:26:35.866 A:middle
where the user is doing nothing
but waiting for the download

00:26:35.866 --> 00:26:37.536 A:middle
to finish and we will
talk a little bit more

00:26:37.536 --> 00:26:38.166 A:middle
about this later.

00:26:38.736 --> 00:26:42.636 A:middle
The second kind of priority is
called a preservation priority.

00:26:43.266 --> 00:26:46.716 A:middle
So this method provides ordering
of purging for unused tags

00:26:46.716 --> 00:26:48.486 A:middle
in your app, so this
is not associated

00:26:48.486 --> 00:26:50.766 A:middle
with a particular request,
which is why it's an extension

00:26:50.766 --> 00:26:54.606 A:middle
on NSBundle, but instead
with a tag or set of tags.

00:26:55.066 --> 00:26:57.016 A:middle
Again, the value
ranges from 0 to 1,

00:26:57.386 --> 00:26:59.586 A:middle
with 0 being the least
interesting to keep

00:26:59.686 --> 00:27:01.396 A:middle
and 1 being the most
important to keep.



00:26:59.686 --> 00:27:01.396 A:middle
and 1 being the most
important to keep.

00:27:02.246 --> 00:27:05.116 A:middle
So you can use this to
tell the system a hint

00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:08.646 A:middle
about which content is the most
important to keep if we run

00:27:08.646 --> 00:27:10.306 A:middle
into disk space pressure.

00:27:10.916 --> 00:27:12.536 A:middle
And the value, again,
is compared only

00:27:12.536 --> 00:27:13.716 A:middle
across your own application,

00:27:13.716 --> 00:27:15.486 A:middle
not between applications
on the system.

00:27:16.006 --> 00:27:19.136 A:middle
So with that, I would like
to bring back Steve to go

00:27:19.136 --> 00:27:21.206 A:middle
over some more best
practices about using ODR.

00:27:22.016 --> 00:27:23.926 A:middle
[Applause]

00:27:23.926 --> 00:27:24.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; STEVE LEWALLEN:
Thank you, Tony.

00:27:28.286 --> 00:27:31.246 A:middle
All right, so now we
have an overview of ODR,

00:27:31.246 --> 00:27:33.826 A:middle
we understand what it's about,
and we have seen it in use.

00:27:34.336 --> 00:27:37.166 A:middle
So now let's talk about
how we build the optimal

00:27:37.166 --> 00:27:38.036 A:middle
ODR application.

00:27:38.846 --> 00:27:40.896 A:middle
Now, to do that, the
first thing that you need

00:27:40.896 --> 00:27:43.056 A:middle
to do before you start
tagging assets is

00:27:43.056 --> 00:27:44.776 A:middle
to consider your app's behavior,

00:27:45.246 --> 00:27:48.036 A:middle
because this will inform
how you need to tag assets.

00:27:48.866 --> 00:27:51.636 A:middle
There are three patterns that
I can offer up for you today

00:27:51.636 --> 00:27:54.866 A:middle
as to how you might
use ODR content.

00:27:55.156 --> 00:27:58.716 A:middle
The first pattern, this is
like Tony's iTravel app.

00:27:59.056 --> 00:28:02.006 A:middle
We couldn't quite anticipate
where the user would want to go.



00:27:59.056 --> 00:28:02.006 A:middle
We couldn't quite anticipate
where the user would want to go.

00:28:02.726 --> 00:28:03.756 A:middle
This is random access.

00:28:03.756 --> 00:28:06.046 A:middle
And in a random access app,

00:28:06.046 --> 00:28:09.626 A:middle
especially when the assets are
larger, the content in total,

00:28:09.626 --> 00:28:13.496 A:middle
what you want to do is tag
more assets and read things

00:28:13.496 --> 00:28:16.526 A:middle
in progressively so that as soon
as the user makes a decision,

00:28:16.846 --> 00:28:18.706 A:middle
they can start to
see some progress

00:28:18.706 --> 00:28:19.806 A:middle
of that decision in the UI.

00:28:21.446 --> 00:28:24.516 A:middle
The next pattern is
called limited prediction.

00:28:24.516 --> 00:28:27.886 A:middle
This is like an open
world game in some sense,

00:28:28.356 --> 00:28:30.886 A:middle
where though there may be
almost an infinite number

00:28:30.886 --> 00:28:33.036 A:middle
of possibilities,
at any one point

00:28:33.036 --> 00:28:34.856 A:middle
in time there's only
a limited subset.

00:28:34.856 --> 00:28:36.586 A:middle
An so again what you want

00:28:36.586 --> 00:28:40.446 A:middle
to do is have many tags
tagging smaller size content,

00:28:40.726 --> 00:28:43.606 A:middle
progressively read that
in, but also be prepared

00:28:43.606 --> 00:28:48.286 A:middle
to discard content that the
user has chosen not to view, as,

00:28:48.286 --> 00:28:50.916 A:middle
for example, the player in the
game moves around the world

00:28:50.916 --> 00:28:54.526 A:middle
and they have left some
location, you should stop using

00:28:54.526 --> 00:28:56.636 A:middle
that indexing resources,
getting rid

00:28:56.636 --> 00:28:58.346 A:middle
of the NSBundleResourceRequest
object.

00:28:59.206 --> 00:29:02.086 A:middle
Now, the third pattern is the
pattern than I've been using



00:28:59.206 --> 00:29:02.086 A:middle
Now, the third pattern is the
pattern than I've been using

00:29:02.086 --> 00:29:03.956 A:middle
in my example; it's
the levels in the game.

00:29:04.186 --> 00:29:06.676 A:middle
This is the linear
progression game much

00:29:06.676 --> 00:29:07.926 A:middle
like a first person shooter.

00:29:08.446 --> 00:29:11.866 A:middle
In this case, the biggest task
that you have as a developer is

00:29:11.866 --> 00:29:15.526 A:middle
to anticipate well ahead of
time what will be needed next,

00:29:16.016 --> 00:29:17.896 A:middle
but you are pretty
much assured that all

00:29:17.896 --> 00:29:20.206 A:middle
of the content will be
consumed, and so you just want

00:29:20.206 --> 00:29:22.416 A:middle
to start loading that content

00:29:22.896 --> 00:29:26.406 A:middle
within a reasonable
amount of time.

00:29:26.626 --> 00:29:31.546 A:middle
Okay. Speaking of time, there is
a rhythm to how you use ODR API.

00:29:32.296 --> 00:29:34.036 A:middle
So let's give ourselves
a timeline

00:29:34.106 --> 00:29:36.966 A:middle
from the point the app
launches until it exits.

00:29:38.036 --> 00:29:41.196 A:middle
Now, the well-written ODR
application will anticipate

00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:43.236 A:middle
needing assets well beforehand.

00:29:43.856 --> 00:29:45.366 A:middle
Remember, this is a
network-based app.

00:29:45.366 --> 00:29:47.156 A:middle
It's going to have to
download it from the Store

00:29:47.476 --> 00:29:49.466 A:middle
or another location
we went over earlier,

00:29:49.596 --> 00:29:50.676 A:middle
but that will take some time.

00:29:51.286 --> 00:29:54.066 A:middle
So as soon as you anticipate
needing them, assets,

00:29:54.246 --> 00:29:56.836 A:middle
that's when you call
beginAccessingResources

00:29:56.836 --> 00:29:58.486 A:middle
and that will kick
off the download

00:29:58.896 --> 00:30:00.766 A:middle
if the assets are not
yet on the device.



00:29:58.896 --> 00:30:00.766 A:middle
if the assets are not
yet on the device.

00:30:01.956 --> 00:30:05.826 A:middle
Now, the best-laid plans can
hit, well, network problems,

00:30:05.826 --> 00:30:08.386 A:middle
for example, and other
things that may result

00:30:08.386 --> 00:30:11.336 A:middle
in you needing the resources
before they are actually ready.

00:30:11.786 --> 00:30:15.696 A:middle
And, again, in this case, you
want to bring up the progress UI

00:30:15.696 --> 00:30:17.606 A:middle
that Tony mentioned using
the progress property

00:30:17.606 --> 00:30:18.966 A:middle
and NSBundleResourceRequest.

00:30:19.696 --> 00:30:22.686 A:middle
Share your learning screen,
allow the download to continue,

00:30:22.686 --> 00:30:25.296 A:middle
and then at some point
that will actually finish,

00:30:25.586 --> 00:30:27.866 A:middle
the resources will be
available and you can take

00:30:27.866 --> 00:30:31.076 A:middle
down the loading screen, and you
can begin to use the resources.

00:30:31.936 --> 00:30:35.206 A:middle
Once you are done using the
resources, you absolutely want

00:30:35.206 --> 00:30:37.276 A:middle
to call endAccessingResources

00:30:37.776 --> 00:30:40.056 A:middle
or allow the
NSBundleResourceRequest object

00:30:40.126 --> 00:30:43.556 A:middle
to dealloc in order to tell the
system, hey, I'm done with this.

00:30:44.026 --> 00:30:46.256 A:middle
And remember that that
doesn't mean we go off

00:30:46.256 --> 00:30:47.206 A:middle
and delete that content.

00:30:47.296 --> 00:30:49.066 A:middle
We are just making a note of it.

00:30:49.336 --> 00:30:51.866 A:middle
So this is the basic timeline
you need to be aware of,

00:30:52.186 --> 00:30:54.776 A:middle
and you can make multiple
these requests simultaneously,

00:30:54.776 --> 00:30:57.906 A:middle
you just need to remember
the basic parts of this.

00:30:58.666 --> 00:31:04.756 A:middle
Okay. Now, I had talked about
how ODR can benefit the user



00:30:58.666 --> 00:31:04.756 A:middle
Okay. Now, I had talked about
how ODR can benefit the user

00:31:04.756 --> 00:31:06.896 A:middle
by improving the
installation experience.

00:31:07.756 --> 00:31:08.976 A:middle
So how is that done?

00:31:08.976 --> 00:31:10.666 A:middle
Well, we need your
help to do that.

00:31:11.726 --> 00:31:13.176 A:middle
What you need to do
as a developer is

00:31:13.176 --> 00:31:16.576 A:middle
to consider the assets that the
user is going to need as soon

00:31:16.576 --> 00:31:17.406 A:middle
as they launch the app.

00:31:18.716 --> 00:31:20.846 A:middle
When you know what those
are, say the first level

00:31:20.846 --> 00:31:24.126 A:middle
in the game is a good one,
then you want to take the tags

00:31:24.126 --> 00:31:28.246 A:middle
for those assets and put them in
Xcode's Initial Install Tags UI.

00:31:29.816 --> 00:31:33.676 A:middle
This will tell the ODR system
to make sure all the assets

00:31:34.206 --> 00:31:39.066 A:middle
with those tags are
downloaded before the app shows

00:31:39.066 --> 00:31:40.996 A:middle
as being 100% installed.

00:31:41.066 --> 00:31:43.186 A:middle
That way when it does show
it's completely installed

00:31:43.186 --> 00:31:44.986 A:middle
and the user taps on
it, it's ready to go.

00:31:45.056 --> 00:31:47.126 A:middle
They are ready to
play that game.

00:31:47.126 --> 00:31:50.536 A:middle
The size of your app that you
see in the App Store is going

00:31:50.536 --> 00:31:53.726 A:middle
to be the size of the
dot app plus the size

00:31:53.726 --> 00:31:56.266 A:middle
of the initial ODR content
that you have tagged here,

00:31:56.686 --> 00:31:58.046 A:middle
so just to be aware
and we will talk

00:31:58.046 --> 00:31:59.706 A:middle
about this point a
little bit later as well.



00:32:00.796 --> 00:32:04.406 A:middle
Okay. So now let's talk about
automating the installation

00:32:04.406 --> 00:32:07.496 A:middle
of ODR content between the
time the app is actually fully

00:32:07.496 --> 00:32:10.306 A:middle
installed, but the user has
still not actually launched it,

00:32:10.436 --> 00:32:12.606 A:middle
because you can automate
that period of time as well.

00:32:13.546 --> 00:32:16.086 A:middle
You could use this, for example,
to make sure the second level

00:32:16.086 --> 00:32:19.376 A:middle
in the game is loading,
or, for example, tutorials.

00:32:19.496 --> 00:32:21.776 A:middle
Maybe some customers want
to see these tutorials

00:32:21.776 --> 00:32:24.066 A:middle
and others don't, so you are
not going to prevent the app

00:32:24.266 --> 00:32:26.446 A:middle
from actually running if
the tutorial isn't there,

00:32:26.746 --> 00:32:28.286 A:middle
but you would like to
make sure it is there

00:32:28.286 --> 00:32:29.366 A:middle
if you have the opportunity.

00:32:29.796 --> 00:32:34.266 A:middle
And to do this, you can also
use Xcode's resource tags UI

00:32:34.856 --> 00:32:38.276 A:middle
and put the tags in the
pre-fetch tag order section.

00:32:39.006 --> 00:32:40.926 A:middle
In the actual order
that you place them

00:32:40.926 --> 00:32:44.566 A:middle
in this section is the
order we will download them.

00:32:44.776 --> 00:32:46.506 A:middle
All right.

00:32:46.876 --> 00:32:48.516 A:middle
Now, let's talk about caching.

00:32:48.826 --> 00:32:50.456 A:middle
We mentioned caching earlier

00:32:50.456 --> 00:32:53.956 A:middle
and we showed how the
system purged game Level 1

00:32:53.956 --> 00:32:55.906 A:middle
to make space for a new level.

00:32:56.736 --> 00:32:59.746 A:middle
The first thing you need to
know is we only purge content

00:32:59.806 --> 00:33:01.706 A:middle
when the system is low on space.



00:32:59.806 --> 00:33:01.706 A:middle
when the system is low on space.

00:33:02.596 --> 00:33:04.436 A:middle
And the only content
that is there

00:33:04.436 --> 00:33:05.946 A:middle
to be purged is ODR content.

00:33:07.056 --> 00:33:10.026 A:middle
When we do come to that point,
there are several attributes

00:33:10.026 --> 00:33:11.596 A:middle
that come into play to inform us

00:33:11.786 --> 00:33:15.136 A:middle
as to what decision we
should make in deleting

00:33:15.136 --> 00:33:17.376 A:middle
which asset pack, for example.

00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:19.446 A:middle
These are pretty obvious.

00:33:20.106 --> 00:33:22.386 A:middle
One is when did you
last use the asset.

00:33:22.436 --> 00:33:25.846 A:middle
So, for example, game Level 1
that was played last Tuesday,

00:33:25.846 --> 00:33:28.656 A:middle
that's probably a better
candidate to delete

00:33:28.656 --> 00:33:31.896 A:middle
than the level you
finished last night.

00:33:32.156 --> 00:33:35.306 A:middle
Also as Tony mentioned you
have preservation priority

00:33:35.306 --> 00:33:37.116 A:middle
which is a ranking
you can place on tags.

00:33:38.026 --> 00:33:39.616 A:middle
So this is your own
ranking but we take

00:33:39.616 --> 00:33:40.716 A:middle
that into account as well.

00:33:41.416 --> 00:33:43.496 A:middle
And finally, we take

00:33:43.496 --> 00:33:45.146 A:middle
into account the
running state of the app.

00:33:45.686 --> 00:33:48.616 A:middle
We will not delete any asset
packs from a running app

00:33:48.986 --> 00:33:51.116 A:middle
when those assets
are actually in use.

00:33:51.726 --> 00:33:56.876 A:middle
Now, there are a few
strategies you can use

00:33:57.136 --> 00:33:59.216 A:middle
to help preserve
your ODR content.

00:33:59.896 --> 00:34:02.116 A:middle
One of them is to
avoid overpurging.



00:33:59.896 --> 00:34:02.116 A:middle
One of them is to
avoid overpurging.

00:34:02.546 --> 00:34:03.506 A:middle
What do I mean by this?

00:34:03.506 --> 00:34:04.886 A:middle
Let me give you an example.

00:34:05.366 --> 00:34:07.886 A:middle
Let's say the system
needs 100 megabytes,

00:34:08.676 --> 00:34:09.985 A:middle
and it's gone everywhere else

00:34:09.985 --> 00:34:11.466 A:middle
to find the space,
it can't find it.

00:34:12.436 --> 00:34:14.815 A:middle
Through the attributes we
discussed just a moment ago,

00:34:15.536 --> 00:34:17.326 A:middle
it's located one of
your asset packs,

00:34:17.356 --> 00:34:19.646 A:middle
but that asset pack
is 512 megabytes.

00:34:20.196 --> 00:34:22.565 A:middle
We are going to have to
purge that asset pack

00:34:22.565 --> 00:34:25.436 A:middle
if it met the conditions
so we will have overpurged

00:34:25.476 --> 00:34:30.085 A:middle
by 412 megabytes, so it's better
to keep your asset pack smaller.

00:34:30.085 --> 00:34:33.735 A:middle
As I mentioned earlier, this
is also good because you want

00:34:33.735 --> 00:34:35.916 A:middle
to progressively download
and consume content,

00:34:36.295 --> 00:34:37.835 A:middle
so smaller is better
there as well.

00:34:38.226 --> 00:34:40.786 A:middle
But smaller is also better
here to avoid overpurging.

00:34:41.985 --> 00:34:43.036 A:middle
All right.

00:34:44.335 --> 00:34:46.466 A:middle
Another thing you might
be tempted to do is

00:34:46.466 --> 00:34:49.696 A:middle
to tag everything with a
1.0 preservation priority,

00:34:50.326 --> 00:34:51.775 A:middle
but that doesn't
really help you.

00:34:52.286 --> 00:34:55.696 A:middle
That just makes more of
your assets look equivalent

00:34:55.786 --> 00:34:58.166 A:middle
to the system when it
comes to it looking

00:34:58.166 --> 00:35:00.206 A:middle
at purging something
from your app.



00:34:58.166 --> 00:35:00.206 A:middle
at purging something
from your app.

00:35:00.206 --> 00:35:03.426 A:middle
So you want to use the
1.0 value judiciously.

00:35:03.996 --> 00:35:08.946 A:middle
And finally, again, make
sure, because we look

00:35:08.946 --> 00:35:12.426 A:middle
at the last used date that you
endAccessingResources as soon

00:35:12.426 --> 00:35:14.186 A:middle
as you are done with the tags

00:35:14.916 --> 00:35:18.056 A:middle
or you allow the
NSBundleResourceRequest object

00:35:18.186 --> 00:35:19.506 A:middle
to deallocate as
soon as possible.

00:35:19.806 --> 00:35:22.526 A:middle
This helps the system know
how you are using the assets

00:35:22.526 --> 00:35:26.286 A:middle
so it can make the
best decisions.

00:35:26.286 --> 00:35:28.276 A:middle
Okay. Now, I would be
remiss if I didn't talk

00:35:28.276 --> 00:35:30.086 A:middle
about performance in this talk.

00:35:31.506 --> 00:35:33.626 A:middle
One of the things that
we have been doing here

00:35:33.626 --> 00:35:37.506 A:middle
in this session is to encourage
you to download content

00:35:37.506 --> 00:35:38.926 A:middle
in the background ahead of time.

00:35:40.056 --> 00:35:43.966 A:middle
But we don't want to
do that at the expense

00:35:43.966 --> 00:35:46.326 A:middle
of consuming more
resources of the system

00:35:46.656 --> 00:35:47.826 A:middle
than your app can tolerate.

00:35:48.596 --> 00:35:51.776 A:middle
So we balance the speed of a
download with the resources,

00:35:51.776 --> 00:35:54.836 A:middle
CPU and otherwise, that we
consume while we download

00:35:54.836 --> 00:35:57.136 A:middle
and process these asset packs.

00:35:57.226 --> 00:35:58.016 A:middle
That's the default.

00:35:58.496 --> 00:36:00.746 A:middle
But if you get into a
situation or you just want



00:35:58.496 --> 00:36:00.746 A:middle
But if you get into a
situation or you just want

00:36:00.746 --> 00:36:02.236 A:middle
to manage this all on
your own and you want

00:36:02.236 --> 00:36:04.586 A:middle
to put full throttle
down, then you can set it

00:36:04.586 --> 00:36:08.476 A:middle
with the urgent priority, and we
will disregard that balancing,

00:36:08.476 --> 00:36:10.946 A:middle
and we will download the
content as quickly as possible.

00:36:11.626 --> 00:36:14.966 A:middle
Again, as Tony mentioned, this
is a good time to set this

00:36:14.966 --> 00:36:17.096 A:middle
when you are putting
up the loading screen,

00:36:17.616 --> 00:36:20.976 A:middle
but your app actually may be
tolerant to the CPU usage,

00:36:20.976 --> 00:36:24.366 A:middle
for example, that we have on the
system when we are doing this.

00:36:24.596 --> 00:36:27.986 A:middle
So it's all up to you.

00:36:27.986 --> 00:36:32.516 A:middle
And also, we should talk
about performance testing.

00:36:32.516 --> 00:36:35.346 A:middle
You need to do real world
testing for an ODR application.

00:36:35.616 --> 00:36:38.176 A:middle
An ODR application is a
network-based application.

00:36:38.486 --> 00:36:41.106 A:middle
So when you have your
device connected via USB

00:36:41.106 --> 00:36:44.806 A:middle
to your MacBook Pro, for
example, running Xcode,

00:36:45.026 --> 00:36:48.006 A:middle
that's not a real
world scenario.

00:36:48.006 --> 00:36:48.976 A:middle
That's just far too fast.

00:36:49.926 --> 00:36:51.706 A:middle
So what you want to do is

00:36:51.706 --> 00:36:56.176 A:middle
to test your app using perhaps
TestFlight or Xcode Server.

00:36:57.506 --> 00:37:01.976 A:middle
And then also use the Developer
Tools Network Link Conditioner



00:36:57.506 --> 00:37:01.976 A:middle
And then also use the Developer
Tools Network Link Conditioner

00:37:02.696 --> 00:37:05.246 A:middle
to test out various
networking conditions

00:37:06.046 --> 00:37:08.006 A:middle
that might cause
issues for your app

00:37:08.526 --> 00:37:10.576 A:middle
in how soon ODR content
is downloading.

00:37:11.056 --> 00:37:13.806 A:middle
In fact, I would recommend using
this tool for any networking

00:37:13.806 --> 00:37:14.806 A:middle
that you are doing
from your app.

00:37:14.806 --> 00:37:15.396 A:middle
It's really great.

00:37:15.846 --> 00:37:18.236 A:middle
If you haven't used it
before, I would like to cover

00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:19.426 A:middle
that now just briefly.

00:37:19.786 --> 00:37:23.286 A:middle
So when you attach
your device via USB

00:37:23.286 --> 00:37:26.506 A:middle
to your MacBook Pro again,
for example, of running Xcode

00:37:26.506 --> 00:37:28.606 A:middle
and you then you go to Settings
on your device you are going

00:37:28.606 --> 00:37:30.676 A:middle
to see this entry,
a developer entry.

00:37:30.676 --> 00:37:34.496 A:middle
You tap that and you
will see numerous numbers

00:37:34.916 --> 00:37:38.596 A:middle
of developer settings that you
can use in logging, et cetera,

00:37:38.596 --> 00:37:41.586 A:middle
and in the middle there is
the Network Link Conditioner.

00:37:41.936 --> 00:37:46.546 A:middle
So you tap that, and now you
see the options that you can use

00:37:46.546 --> 00:37:49.906 A:middle
to cause various
conditions to be present

00:37:49.906 --> 00:37:52.296 A:middle
when networking out of your app.

00:37:52.296 --> 00:37:55.816 A:middle
To use this, you enable the
Network Link Conditioner,

00:37:56.206 --> 00:37:59.016 A:middle
and then you decide what type
of situation you want to create.

00:37:59.406 --> 00:38:03.606 A:middle
Perhaps you want to mimic 100%
loss or very slow network,



00:37:59.406 --> 00:38:03.606 A:middle
Perhaps you want to mimic 100%
loss or very slow network,

00:38:04.386 --> 00:38:08.546 A:middle
or perhaps a high latency in
DNS lookups, or you just want

00:38:08.546 --> 00:38:10.266 A:middle
to reproduce a really
bad network.

00:38:10.966 --> 00:38:12.896 A:middle
So this is a great tool

00:38:12.896 --> 00:38:17.736 A:middle
to use while you test
your ODR application.

00:38:17.736 --> 00:38:21.016 A:middle
Okay. Now, speaking
of networking issues,

00:38:21.016 --> 00:38:24.326 A:middle
you may encounter a couple of
networking errors along the way.

00:38:24.986 --> 00:38:26.166 A:middle
One of them is this one.

00:38:26.166 --> 00:38:27.506 A:middle
Obviously there is no network.

00:38:28.046 --> 00:38:31.316 A:middle
So if your app needed ODR
content and there is no network,

00:38:31.316 --> 00:38:33.526 A:middle
you need to be ready to
handle this situation.

00:38:35.036 --> 00:38:38.756 A:middle
Another area you may encounter
is resource unavailable,

00:38:38.756 --> 00:38:41.556 A:middle
and basically what this means is
we thought the ODR content was

00:38:41.556 --> 00:38:43.546 A:middle
going to be in a certain
location and it wasn't.

00:38:44.086 --> 00:38:47.256 A:middle
Generally the case or the cause
of this will be, for example,

00:38:47.256 --> 00:38:50.206 A:middle
setting up a server
inside of your own company

00:38:50.206 --> 00:38:52.186 A:middle
and someone is managing
it, moving things around,

00:38:52.526 --> 00:38:55.506 A:middle
and they just weren't ready
for the users to use that app.

00:38:56.176 --> 00:38:59.466 A:middle
So just to be ready
for that error as well.

00:38:59.896 --> 00:39:04.056 A:middle
Another class of error that
you can encounter relates



00:38:59.896 --> 00:39:04.056 A:middle
Another class of error that
you can encounter relates

00:39:04.056 --> 00:39:05.026 A:middle
to storage space.

00:39:06.296 --> 00:39:11.336 A:middle
So ODR will allow your app
to have a maximum of 2 gig

00:39:11.336 --> 00:39:12.586 A:middle
in use at any one time.

00:39:13.466 --> 00:39:15.286 A:middle
What this means is
your app is running,

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:18.916 A:middle
you have called
beginAccessingResources on tags

00:39:19.466 --> 00:39:22.216 A:middle
that amount to 2 gigabytes,

00:39:22.806 --> 00:39:24.936 A:middle
you haven't called
endAccessingResources on any

00:39:24.936 --> 00:39:28.326 A:middle
of those, you haven't allowed
the NSBundleResourceRequest

00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:32.166 A:middle
to dealloc for any of those,
so that 2 gig is in use.

00:39:32.486 --> 00:39:34.026 A:middle
And then you go and
make another request.

00:39:34.446 --> 00:39:36.116 A:middle
That goes over and you
are going to get an error

00:39:36.116 --> 00:39:37.506 A:middle
in your request, a callback.

00:39:38.316 --> 00:39:40.856 A:middle
So be aware of that as well.

00:39:41.336 --> 00:39:44.576 A:middle
Also, of course, we just might
hit a low-space condition

00:39:44.866 --> 00:39:46.296 A:middle
on local storage on the device.

00:39:46.296 --> 00:39:48.076 A:middle
And you will get
this notification.

00:39:48.806 --> 00:39:51.196 A:middle
This can happen if you
have initiated a download

00:39:51.196 --> 00:39:54.736 A:middle
or maybe it happens long
after you made that request.

00:39:55.766 --> 00:39:57.186 A:middle
So just be prepared
to handle that.

00:39:57.566 --> 00:39:59.156 A:middle
To handle it you could
do a couple of things;

00:39:59.196 --> 00:40:01.006 A:middle
you could endAccessingResources



00:39:59.196 --> 00:40:01.006 A:middle
you could endAccessingResources

00:40:01.006 --> 00:40:03.236 A:middle
on any ODR content
you no longer need.

00:40:04.656 --> 00:40:06.926 A:middle
And you can also look
at what you are storing

00:40:06.926 --> 00:40:09.416 A:middle
on the local device, perhaps
some caches or other documents

00:40:09.416 --> 00:40:10.456 A:middle
that you actually don't need,

00:40:10.866 --> 00:40:12.946 A:middle
and you could free those
up and delete those.

00:40:13.486 --> 00:40:18.556 A:middle
So now let's talk
about cellular data.

00:40:18.866 --> 00:40:21.586 A:middle
Again, an ODR application
is a network application.

00:40:22.066 --> 00:40:25.016 A:middle
So it is governed by the
same cellular data switch

00:40:25.896 --> 00:40:27.816 A:middle
that controls the rest
of your app's networking.

00:40:28.246 --> 00:40:30.846 A:middle
So if that switch is
off, you will not be able

00:40:30.846 --> 00:40:32.166 A:middle
to get any ODR content.

00:40:33.176 --> 00:40:36.546 A:middle
If that switch is on, and you
are downloading ODR content,

00:40:37.176 --> 00:40:41.316 A:middle
then any of that data that
you use over cellular is going

00:40:41.316 --> 00:40:43.176 A:middle
to be attributed to your app.

00:40:43.576 --> 00:40:46.216 A:middle
So this should encourage
you to make sure you ask

00:40:46.476 --> 00:40:48.256 A:middle
for what you need
and not any more.

00:40:49.016 --> 00:40:52.936 A:middle
We don't want to run
up a user's bill.

00:40:53.146 --> 00:40:56.666 A:middle
And finally, the 100-megabyte
cellular download limit still

00:40:56.666 --> 00:40:58.286 A:middle
applies to ODR applications,

00:40:58.626 --> 00:41:01.966 A:middle
so remember where I had
the dot app plus the size



00:40:58.626 --> 00:41:01.966 A:middle
so remember where I had
the dot app plus the size

00:41:01.966 --> 00:41:04.086 A:middle
of initial ODR adding
to up the size

00:41:04.086 --> 00:41:05.526 A:middle
of the app listed
in the App Store?

00:41:06.046 --> 00:41:09.196 A:middle
Well, if that's greater than 100
megabytes, your app is not going

00:41:09.196 --> 00:41:12.086 A:middle
to download over cellular,
just like a normal app

00:41:12.266 --> 00:41:14.166 A:middle
that was greater than
100 megabytes would not.

00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:18.406 A:middle
So you need to be aware of
that limitation as well.

00:41:20.656 --> 00:41:24.146 A:middle
Finally, as we begin
to wrap this up,

00:41:24.146 --> 00:41:27.146 A:middle
there is some vital statistics
that you need to be aware of.

00:41:27.896 --> 00:41:32.996 A:middle
First of all, although you can
have an ODR application have a

00:41:32.996 --> 00:41:34.886 A:middle
size of up to 20
gig in the Store,

00:41:35.436 --> 00:41:39.666 A:middle
a maximum of 2 gig is
reserved for your dot app.

00:41:40.076 --> 00:41:41.156 A:middle
So your dot app itself?

00:41:41.406 --> 00:41:43.586 A:middle
Remember when we teased apart
the assets from your dot app,

00:41:43.586 --> 00:41:45.136 A:middle
we had the asset packs
and then your dot app?

00:41:45.586 --> 00:41:47.876 A:middle
That dot app can be a
maximum of 2 gigabytes.

00:41:48.286 --> 00:41:50.706 A:middle
The rest of it can be
ODR content up to 20 gig.

00:41:50.876 --> 00:41:56.416 A:middle
And you can have a
maximum of 2 gig of initial

00:41:56.416 --> 00:41:58.126 A:middle
and pre-fetched ODR content.

00:41:58.126 --> 00:42:00.106 A:middle
This is the content we
set up in Xcode's UI



00:41:58.126 --> 00:42:00.106 A:middle
This is the content we
set up in Xcode's UI

00:42:01.146 --> 00:42:03.636 A:middle
to download things
during the app install

00:42:03.636 --> 00:42:04.736 A:middle
and right afterwards.

00:42:05.016 --> 00:42:10.596 A:middle
You can have a maximum of two
gigabytes of that combined,

00:42:10.596 --> 00:42:13.696 A:middle
and as I mentioned just a moment
ago, a maximum of two gigabytes

00:42:13.776 --> 00:42:16.656 A:middle
in use at any one time.

00:42:16.766 --> 00:42:19.896 A:middle
And finally, a given asset
pack can be a maximum

00:42:19.896 --> 00:42:21.236 A:middle
of 512 megabytes.

00:42:22.786 --> 00:42:25.366 A:middle
So if you take a single tag
and tag a bunch of resources,

00:42:25.496 --> 00:42:28.766 A:middle
and that adds up to more than
512 megabytes, Xcode is going

00:42:28.766 --> 00:42:31.586 A:middle
to give you a warning, but
it will allow you to continue

00:42:31.586 --> 00:42:34.946 A:middle
to develop your app or game, but
when you submit to the Store,

00:42:34.946 --> 00:42:36.456 A:middle
you are going to get
a submission failure,

00:42:36.936 --> 00:42:41.176 A:middle
and the submission failure
error message will explain why.

00:42:41.406 --> 00:42:45.796 A:middle
Okay. So in summary, On Demand
Resources is a dynamically

00:42:45.796 --> 00:42:46.966 A:middle
loaded content system.

00:42:47.896 --> 00:42:49.156 A:middle
Hosted in the App Store.

00:42:50.156 --> 00:42:51.146 A:middle
This can be automated

00:42:51.666 --> 00:42:55.056 A:middle
to download content during app
install time and by request.

00:42:56.236 --> 00:42:58.436 A:middle
You can prioritize or
order these downloads.

00:42:59.776 --> 00:43:02.146 A:middle
We have an intelligent caching
mechanism so that, for example,



00:42:59.776 --> 00:43:02.146 A:middle
We have an intelligent caching
mechanism so that, for example,

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:05.246 A:middle
we could get rid of that game
Level 1 in order to make space

00:43:05.296 --> 00:43:10.846 A:middle
for a following level, and
you get 20 gig in the Store.

00:43:11.026 --> 00:43:13.916 A:middle
So for more information we
have a great new documentation

00:43:13.916 --> 00:43:16.596 A:middle
on ODR; we also have
sample code,

00:43:17.066 --> 00:43:19.616 A:middle
and the developer forums are
always a great place to go.

00:43:19.616 --> 00:43:22.296 A:middle
And if you still have
questions you can follow

00:43:22.296 --> 00:43:24.056 A:middle
up with our App Frameworks
evangelist.

00:43:24.966 --> 00:43:26.576 A:middle
You may have missed
a couple of sessions

00:43:26.906 --> 00:43:30.556 A:middle
on other technologies
that relate to ODR.

00:43:31.146 --> 00:43:35.156 A:middle
Those will be available via
videos on the developer website.

00:43:35.156 --> 00:43:38.716 A:middle
And there is going to be a
session as Tony indicated

00:43:38.716 --> 00:43:43.896 A:middle
about progress on Friday as well
as a lab tomorrow from 11:00

00:43:43.896 --> 00:43:45.766 A:middle
to 1:30 dedicated to ODR.

00:43:46.016 --> 00:43:49.426 A:middle
Tony and I and the extended ODR
engineering team will be there

00:43:49.426 --> 00:43:51.146 A:middle
to answer any of your questions,

00:43:51.146 --> 00:43:52.956 A:middle
get you started using
ODR content,

00:43:52.956 --> 00:43:56.446 A:middle
and listen to any
suggestions you might have.

00:43:56.926 --> 00:43:57.536 A:middle
Thank you very much!

00:43:58.016 --> 00:44:00.000 A:middle
[Applause]
