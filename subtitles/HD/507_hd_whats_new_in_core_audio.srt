00:00:25.516 --> 00:00:30.606 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:31.106 --> 00:00:31.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt;AKSHATHA NAGESH: Thank you.

00:00:32.246 --> 00:00:34.256 A:middle
Good afternoon everyone, welcome

00:00:34.256 --> 00:00:36.466 A:middle
to the session What's
New in Code Audio.

00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.576 A:middle
I am Akshatha Nagesh, and
I will be the first speaker

00:00:40.576 --> 00:00:44.126 A:middle
in this session.

00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:47.646 A:middle
I will be talking about
[unintelligible] AVAudioEngine

00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:52.686 A:middle
and its new features for this
year's iOS and OS X releases.

00:00:53.936 --> 00:00:56.186 A:middle
Later, my colleague
Torrey will be talking

00:00:56.186 --> 00:00:58.986 A:middle
about other exciting
new features we have

00:00:58.986 --> 00:01:02.046 A:middle
for you this year like
inter-device audio



00:00:58.986 --> 00:01:02.046 A:middle
for you this year like
inter-device audio

00:01:02.516 --> 00:01:05.866 A:middle
and what's new in our
good old AVAudioSession.

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.966 A:middle
Tomorrow morning we have another
Core Audio presentation called

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:15.276 A:middle
Audio Unit Extensions and it's
about a whole new set of APIs

00:01:15.276 --> 00:01:18.306 A:middle
which I am sure you will
find very interesting,

00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:23.386 A:middle
so do catch that
session as well.

00:01:23.546 --> 00:01:23.886 A:middle
All right.

00:01:24.476 --> 00:01:28.006 A:middle
Let's begin with a
recap of AVAudioEngine.

00:01:28.596 --> 00:01:33.516 A:middle
If you know about Core
Audio, you may be aware

00:01:33.886 --> 00:01:36.956 A:middle
that we offer a wide
variety of APIs

00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:39.756 A:middle
for implementing
powerful audio features.

00:01:40.836 --> 00:01:45.266 A:middle
Last year, in iOS 8
and OS X Yosemite,

00:01:45.756 --> 00:01:47.456 A:middle
we introduced a new set

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:51.876 A:middle
of Objective-C APIs called
AVAudioEngine as a part

00:01:51.876 --> 00:01:54.066 A:middle
of AVFoundation framework.

00:01:55.496 --> 00:01:58.386 A:middle
If you are not very
familiar with AVAudioEngine,

00:01:58.606 --> 00:02:00.856 A:middle
I would highly encourage
you to check



00:01:58.606 --> 00:02:00.856 A:middle
I would highly encourage
you to check

00:02:00.856 --> 00:02:05.976 A:middle
out our last year's WWDC session
AVAudioEngine In Practice.

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:10.886 A:middle
Let's look at some of the
goals behind this effort.

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:13.536 A:middle
There were three
important goals.

00:02:14.276 --> 00:02:19.216 A:middle
First, to provide a powerful
and a feature-rich API set.

00:02:20.716 --> 00:02:25.866 A:middle
AVAudioEngine is built on top
of our C frameworks; hence,

00:02:25.926 --> 00:02:28.516 A:middle
it supports most of
the powerful features

00:02:28.796 --> 00:02:31.436 A:middle
that our C frameworks
already do.

00:02:32.056 --> 00:02:36.286 A:middle
The second goal was to
enable you to achieve simple,

00:02:36.286 --> 00:02:40.926 A:middle
as well as complex tasks with
only a fraction of the amount

00:02:40.926 --> 00:02:45.126 A:middle
of code that you would write if
using our C frameworks directly.

00:02:46.276 --> 00:02:50.446 A:middle
Now, the task can be as simple
as a playback of an audio file

00:02:51.086 --> 00:02:53.066 A:middle
to as complex as, say,

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:56.136 A:middle
implementing an entire
audio engine for a game.

00:02:56.696 --> 00:03:01.716 A:middle
The third important goal was
to simplify real-time audio.



00:02:56.696 --> 00:03:01.716 A:middle
The third important goal was
to simplify real-time audio.

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:06.316 A:middle
AVAudioEngine is a
real-time audio system,

00:03:07.046 --> 00:03:11.476 A:middle
but yet it offers a
non-real-time interface for you

00:03:11.476 --> 00:03:15.886 A:middle
to interact with and, hence,
hides most of the complexities

00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:19.086 A:middle
in dealing with real-time
audio underneath.

00:03:20.426 --> 00:03:24.736 A:middle
This, again, enhances the ease
of usability of AVAudioEngine.

00:03:25.276 --> 00:03:28.506 A:middle
On to some of the features.

00:03:29.906 --> 00:03:32.766 A:middle
It is an Objective-C
API set and, hence,

00:03:32.976 --> 00:03:35.086 A:middle
accessible from Swift as well.

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:39.406 A:middle
It supports low latency
real-time audio.

00:03:40.616 --> 00:03:44.406 A:middle
Using AVAudioEngine, you will
be able to perform a variety

00:03:44.406 --> 00:03:47.706 A:middle
of audio tasks, like
play and record audio,

00:03:48.746 --> 00:03:51.796 A:middle
connect various audio
processing blocks together

00:03:51.986 --> 00:03:53.476 A:middle
to form your processing chain.

00:03:54.516 --> 00:03:58.406 A:middle
You could capture audio at any
point in this processing chain,

00:03:58.586 --> 00:04:00.836 A:middle
say for your analysis
or debugging.



00:03:58.586 --> 00:04:00.836 A:middle
say for your analysis
or debugging.

00:04:01.766 --> 00:04:05.226 A:middle
And also, you could
implement 3D audio for games.

00:04:07.876 --> 00:04:10.336 A:middle
Now, what is the
engine comprised of?

00:04:11.616 --> 00:04:14.606 A:middle
A node is a basic building
block of the engine.

00:04:15.676 --> 00:04:18.856 A:middle
The engine itself
manages a graph of nodes

00:04:19.026 --> 00:04:20.546 A:middle
that you connect together.

00:04:21.956 --> 00:04:25.976 A:middle
A node can be one of
three types, source nodes

00:04:26.426 --> 00:04:30.096 A:middle
that provide data for
entering, processing nodes

00:04:30.156 --> 00:04:33.656 A:middle
that process this data,
and the destination node,

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:37.396 A:middle
which is usually the terminating
node in your processing graph

00:04:37.696 --> 00:04:40.106 A:middle
and refers to the
output node connected

00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:41.286 A:middle
to the output hardware.

00:04:41.286 --> 00:04:45.346 A:middle
Now, let's look at a
sample engine setup.

00:04:46.016 --> 00:04:49.506 A:middle
This could represent
a simple karaoke app.

00:04:51.216 --> 00:04:53.286 A:middle
You could be capturing
users voice

00:04:53.546 --> 00:04:55.936 A:middle
through the microphone
implicitly connected

00:04:56.006 --> 00:04:59.996 A:middle
to the input node, processing
it through an effect node,

00:04:59.996 --> 00:05:01.436 A:middle
which could be a simple delay.



00:04:59.996 --> 00:05:01.436 A:middle
which could be a simple delay.

00:05:02.606 --> 00:05:05.866 A:middle
You could also be
tapping the users voice

00:05:06.326 --> 00:05:10.396 A:middle
through a node tap block,
and analyzing it say

00:05:10.396 --> 00:05:14.556 A:middle
to determine how the user is
performing and based on that,

00:05:14.846 --> 00:05:18.086 A:middle
you could be playing some sound
effects through the player node,

00:05:19.266 --> 00:05:22.156 A:middle
and you could have another
player node that's playing a

00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:24.896 A:middle
backing track in your app.

00:05:24.896 --> 00:05:28.426 A:middle
And all these signals can be
mixed together using a mixer

00:05:28.426 --> 00:05:32.176 A:middle
node and finally played
through the speaker connected

00:05:32.176 --> 00:05:33.166 A:middle
to the output node.

00:05:34.326 --> 00:05:37.246 A:middle
Now, in this setup, your input

00:05:37.246 --> 00:05:39.436 A:middle
and the players form
the source nodes.

00:05:40.886 --> 00:05:45.076 A:middle
The effect and the mixer are
your processing nodes input

00:05:45.076 --> 00:05:48.526 A:middle
and the output node is
the destination node.

00:05:50.956 --> 00:05:54.756 A:middle
Now let's look at these mixer
nodes in a little bit of detail.

00:05:55.926 --> 00:05:59.286 A:middle
There are two kinds of
mixer nodes in the engine.



00:06:00.056 --> 00:06:03.606 A:middle
First is the AV audio
mixer node that we just saw

00:06:03.606 --> 00:06:07.226 A:middle
in the previous example,
and this is mainly used

00:06:07.606 --> 00:06:11.156 A:middle
for sample rate conversion,
up or down mixing of channels,

00:06:12.336 --> 00:06:15.906 A:middle
it supports mono, stereo,
and multichannel inputs.

00:06:17.216 --> 00:06:20.746 A:middle
And the second type of mixer
is called the environment node,

00:06:20.976 --> 00:06:23.516 A:middle
which is mainly used
in gaming applications.

00:06:24.996 --> 00:06:30.046 A:middle
It simulates a 3D space in which
the sources that are connected

00:06:30.046 --> 00:06:33.456 A:middle
to the environment node are
specialized with respect

00:06:33.516 --> 00:06:34.876 A:middle
to an implicit listener.

00:06:36.246 --> 00:06:40.046 A:middle
And environment node supports
mono and stereo inputs

00:06:40.276 --> 00:06:43.126 A:middle
and spatializes mono inputs.

00:06:45.556 --> 00:06:49.426 A:middle
Now, associated with the mixer
nodes and the source nodes,

00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:52.796 A:middle
there is something called
AVAudioMixing protocol.

00:06:53.976 --> 00:06:58.046 A:middle
This protocol defines a set of
properties that are applicable

00:06:58.046 --> 00:07:00.366 A:middle
at the input bus
of a mixer node.



00:06:58.046 --> 00:07:00.366 A:middle
at the input bus
of a mixer node.

00:07:01.626 --> 00:07:05.706 A:middle
And the source nodes conform
to this protocol and, in turn,

00:07:06.206 --> 00:07:08.436 A:middle
control the properties
on the mixers

00:07:08.526 --> 00:07:10.516 A:middle
that they are connected to.

00:07:11.396 --> 00:07:15.246 A:middle
Now, if you set these properties
before making a connection

00:07:15.286 --> 00:07:19.096 A:middle
from the source to the mixer
node, the properties are cached

00:07:19.346 --> 00:07:20.546 A:middle
at the source node level.

00:07:21.676 --> 00:07:24.386 A:middle
And when you actually make a
connection between the source

00:07:24.386 --> 00:07:27.866 A:middle
and the mixer, the properties
take effect on the mixer.

00:07:28.426 --> 00:07:32.396 A:middle
Let's look at some of the
examples for these properties.

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:34.966 A:middle
There are mainly three types --

00:07:35.906 --> 00:07:38.456 A:middle
common mixing properties
that are applicable

00:07:38.576 --> 00:07:40.076 A:middle
on all the mixer nodes.

00:07:40.616 --> 00:07:42.266 A:middle
The example is volume.

00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:47.616 A:middle
Stereo mixing properties like
pan that's applicable only

00:07:47.616 --> 00:07:49.276 A:middle
on the AV audio mixer node.

00:07:50.526 --> 00:07:54.196 A:middle
And 3D mixing properties
like position, obstruction,

00:07:54.196 --> 00:07:57.276 A:middle
occlusion, which is mainly
used in the gaming use case,

00:07:57.526 --> 00:08:00.746 A:middle
and those are applicable
on the environment node.



00:07:57.526 --> 00:08:00.746 A:middle
and those are applicable
on the environment node.

00:08:02.596 --> 00:08:04.486 A:middle
Now let's look at
a sample setup.

00:08:05.076 --> 00:08:08.706 A:middle
Suppose you have a player
node and both these mixers,

00:08:09.036 --> 00:08:11.786 A:middle
mixer node and the
environment node in your engine,

00:08:12.336 --> 00:08:15.316 A:middle
and suppose you set a bunch

00:08:15.316 --> 00:08:17.446 A:middle
of mixing properties
on the player node.

00:08:17.766 --> 00:08:22.196 A:middle
Now, at this point, since
the player is not connected

00:08:22.196 --> 00:08:23.326 A:middle
to either of the mixers,

00:08:23.656 --> 00:08:28.676 A:middle
the properties remain
cached at the player level.

00:08:28.676 --> 00:08:30.956 A:middle
Now suppose you make a
connection to the mixer node.

00:08:31.776 --> 00:08:36.196 A:middle
Now the properties like
volume and pan take effect

00:08:36.196 --> 00:08:40.416 A:middle
on the mixer node, while the 3D
mixing property, like position,

00:08:40.765 --> 00:08:43.275 A:middle
does not affect the mixer node.

00:08:43.826 --> 00:08:47.556 A:middle
Now, if you disconnect
from the mixer and connect

00:08:47.626 --> 00:08:48.846 A:middle
to the environment node,

00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:53.366 A:middle
volume and position take
effect while pan has no effect

00:08:53.546 --> 00:08:54.556 A:middle
on the environment node.

00:08:55.576 --> 00:08:59.176 A:middle
So this way you could have a
bunch of mixing properties set

00:08:59.176 --> 00:09:02.906 A:middle
on a player and move the
player from one mixer



00:08:59.176 --> 00:09:02.906 A:middle
on a player and move the
player from one mixer

00:09:03.176 --> 00:09:05.496 A:middle
to the other mixer
in your application

00:09:05.696 --> 00:09:07.516 A:middle
with the mixing settings intact.

00:09:09.056 --> 00:09:12.106 A:middle
We will revisit this
AVAudioMixing protocol

00:09:12.276 --> 00:09:14.616 A:middle
when we discuss one
of our new features

00:09:14.616 --> 00:09:16.776 A:middle
for this year in a few minutes.

00:09:17.366 --> 00:09:23.266 A:middle
Now, I would like to review
another important aspect

00:09:23.656 --> 00:09:26.506 A:middle
that is how to handle
multichannel audio

00:09:26.756 --> 00:09:28.136 A:middle
with AVAudioEngine.

00:09:28.546 --> 00:09:32.156 A:middle
There are two parts to
the setup involved here.

00:09:32.986 --> 00:09:37.046 A:middle
First is configuring
your hardware to be able

00:09:37.046 --> 00:09:38.956 A:middle
to receive multichannel audio.

00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:42.626 A:middle
Now, the hardware
could be HDMI device

00:09:42.826 --> 00:09:44.736 A:middle
or a USB device and so on.

00:09:46.066 --> 00:09:49.446 A:middle
And the second part is actually
setting the engine itself

00:09:49.806 --> 00:09:52.376 A:middle
to be able to render
multichannel audio

00:09:52.586 --> 00:09:53.456 A:middle
to this hardware.

00:09:54.036 --> 00:09:58.976 A:middle
We will look at these
one by one.

00:09:59.406 --> 00:10:01.446 A:middle
First, hardware setup on OS X.



00:09:59.406 --> 00:10:01.446 A:middle
First, hardware setup on OS X.

00:10:01.446 --> 00:10:07.576 A:middle
On OS X, there is a built-in
system tool called audio MIDI

00:10:07.576 --> 00:10:11.216 A:middle
setup, using which the
user can configure his

00:10:11.256 --> 00:10:12.456 A:middle
multichannel hardware.

00:10:13.366 --> 00:10:15.396 A:middle
So he could use this
tool to, say,

00:10:15.396 --> 00:10:17.316 A:middle
set up the speaker
configuration,

00:10:17.576 --> 00:10:19.166 A:middle
channel layout, et cetera.

00:10:20.116 --> 00:10:24.166 A:middle
And then the app can
set up AVAudioEngine

00:10:24.386 --> 00:10:27.386 A:middle
to use this hardware for
multichannel rendering.

00:10:29.416 --> 00:10:34.546 A:middle
But on iOS, in order to enable
multichannel on the hardware,

00:10:34.876 --> 00:10:38.056 A:middle
the app needs to configure
its AVAudioSession.

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:41.386 A:middle
We will assume a
playback use case

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.796 A:middle
and see what are
the steps involved.

00:10:45.466 --> 00:10:49.546 A:middle
The first thing to do would be
to activate your audio session.

00:10:50.456 --> 00:10:55.856 A:middle
Next you need to check for the
maximum number of open channels

00:10:56.046 --> 00:10:58.116 A:middle
that are available
for your session.

00:10:59.496 --> 00:11:02.016 A:middle
Then you set your
preferred number of channels,



00:10:59.496 --> 00:11:02.016 A:middle
Then you set your
preferred number of channels,

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:06.696 A:middle
and as a final step, you
query back the actual number

00:11:06.756 --> 00:11:09.946 A:middle
of output channels to
verify whether the request

00:11:09.996 --> 00:11:12.026 A:middle
that you just made
went through or not.

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:17.966 A:middle
Now, note that whenever you make
a request for a certain number

00:11:17.966 --> 00:11:20.476 A:middle
of channels, it does
not guarantee

00:11:20.476 --> 00:11:22.526 A:middle
that the request
is always accepted.

00:11:23.176 --> 00:11:24.436 A:middle
Hence, the final step

00:11:24.646 --> 00:11:28.506 A:middle
of verifying the actual output
number of channels is necessary.

00:11:29.066 --> 00:11:32.706 A:middle
Now, in code, it
looks like this.

00:11:32.706 --> 00:11:36.596 A:middle
We will assume an
audio playback use case

00:11:36.866 --> 00:11:39.856 A:middle
and assume you want
a 5.1 rendering.

00:11:40.416 --> 00:11:45.006 A:middle
So the first thing to do would
be to get a shared instance

00:11:45.186 --> 00:11:48.846 A:middle
of the audio session,
set your category

00:11:49.076 --> 00:11:50.896 A:middle
and make the session active.

00:11:51.426 --> 00:11:56.596 A:middle
Next, check the maximum
number of output channels

00:11:56.596 --> 00:11:58.246 A:middle
that are available
in your session.

00:11:58.796 --> 00:12:03.006 A:middle
And based on that, you
set your preferred number



00:11:58.796 --> 00:12:03.006 A:middle
And based on that, you
set your preferred number

00:12:03.006 --> 00:12:04.396 A:middle
of channels on the session.

00:12:04.826 --> 00:12:09.636 A:middle
And as a final step, you
query back the actual number

00:12:09.636 --> 00:12:11.366 A:middle
of output channels
and then adapt

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:16.816 A:middle
to the corresponding
channel count.

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:19.486 A:middle
Okay. So this was all
the hardware setup part.

00:12:20.036 --> 00:12:23.136 A:middle
Now we'll see how to set
up the engine to be able

00:12:23.136 --> 00:12:24.726 A:middle
to render multichannel audio.

00:12:26.536 --> 00:12:28.696 A:middle
Again here there
are two use cases.

00:12:29.496 --> 00:12:33.396 A:middle
First, say you have a
multichannel audio content

00:12:33.396 --> 00:12:35.506 A:middle
available that needs
to be played back

00:12:35.646 --> 00:12:37.036 A:middle
through the multichannel
hardware.

00:12:37.866 --> 00:12:41.396 A:middle
And in this case, you would
use an AV audio mixer node.

00:12:41.396 --> 00:12:46.426 A:middle
And in the second case,
as a gaming scenario

00:12:46.626 --> 00:12:50.286 A:middle
where you want your content to
be spatialized and then played

00:12:50.286 --> 00:12:51.976 A:middle
through the multichannel
hardware.

00:12:52.626 --> 00:12:55.586 A:middle
And here you would use
an environment node.

00:12:57.776 --> 00:13:01.566 A:middle
Case one, you have a
multichannel audio content



00:12:57.776 --> 00:13:01.566 A:middle
Case one, you have a
multichannel audio content

00:13:02.126 --> 00:13:04.936 A:middle
and a multichannel hardware
that's just been set

00:13:04.936 --> 00:13:06.756 A:middle
up as we discussed
a few minutes back.

00:13:08.486 --> 00:13:11.636 A:middle
Now, note that although
the format of the content

00:13:11.636 --> 00:13:14.496 A:middle
and the hardware are shown
to be identical here,

00:13:14.626 --> 00:13:15.896 A:middle
they could very well differ.

00:13:17.176 --> 00:13:21.016 A:middle
And the mixer node here will
take care of channel mapping

00:13:21.546 --> 00:13:23.786 A:middle
between the content and
the hardware format.

00:13:24.466 --> 00:13:27.536 A:middle
So the first thing you need

00:13:27.586 --> 00:13:32.186 A:middle
to do is propagate the hardware
format to the connection

00:13:32.336 --> 00:13:34.606 A:middle
between the mixer
and the output node.

00:13:35.626 --> 00:13:38.216 A:middle
So in code, it looks like this.

00:13:39.246 --> 00:13:43.406 A:middle
You would query the output
format of the output node,

00:13:43.596 --> 00:13:48.076 A:middle
which is the hardware format,
and then use that format

00:13:48.316 --> 00:13:51.036 A:middle
to make the connection
between the mixer node

00:13:51.356 --> 00:13:52.826 A:middle
and the output node.

00:13:55.496 --> 00:13:58.676 A:middle
The next thing is similar
on the content side.

00:13:58.906 --> 00:14:02.126 A:middle
You propagate the content
format to the connection



00:13:58.906 --> 00:14:02.126 A:middle
You propagate the content
format to the connection

00:14:02.226 --> 00:14:04.946 A:middle
between the player
and the mixer node.

00:14:05.796 --> 00:14:08.946 A:middle
So assume you have the
multichannel audio content

00:14:08.946 --> 00:14:09.956 A:middle
in the form of a file.

00:14:10.586 --> 00:14:12.456 A:middle
You can open the
file for reading

00:14:12.756 --> 00:14:16.326 A:middle
and use its processing
format to make the connection

00:14:16.366 --> 00:14:18.316 A:middle
from the player to
the mixer node.

00:14:18.806 --> 00:14:24.006 A:middle
And then you schedule
your file on the player,

00:14:24.506 --> 00:14:26.766 A:middle
you start your engine
and start the player,

00:14:26.846 --> 00:14:30.066 A:middle
and the content will flow
through your processing chain.

00:14:30.646 --> 00:14:37.836 A:middle
Now case two, where it's
typically a gaming scenario

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:40.946 A:middle
and you need your content to
be spatialized and then played

00:14:40.946 --> 00:14:42.226 A:middle
through the multichannel
hardware.

00:14:43.506 --> 00:14:47.526 A:middle
So the steps here are very
much similar, except a couple

00:14:47.526 --> 00:14:48.836 A:middle
of subtle differences.

00:14:49.466 --> 00:14:53.146 A:middle
So the first thing is you
get your hardware format

00:14:53.366 --> 00:14:54.806 A:middle
and set the connection format

00:14:54.806 --> 00:14:59.136 A:middle
between your environment
node and the output node.

00:14:59.346 --> 00:15:03.426 A:middle
Now, since the environment node
supports only specific channel



00:14:59.346 --> 00:15:03.426 A:middle
Now, since the environment node
supports only specific channel

00:15:03.426 --> 00:15:08.046 A:middle
layouts, you need to map the
hardware format to a layout

00:15:08.106 --> 00:15:09.806 A:middle
that the environment
node supports.

00:15:10.696 --> 00:15:12.226 A:middle
So that's the first difference.

00:15:12.576 --> 00:15:15.506 A:middle
So assuming we have
a 5.1 hardware,

00:15:16.186 --> 00:15:20.016 A:middle
we can choose audio
unit 5.0 layout pack

00:15:20.676 --> 00:15:22.736 A:middle
that is supported
by the audio node.

00:15:23.546 --> 00:15:26.516 A:middle
We can create an AV audio
channel layout using this

00:15:26.516 --> 00:15:27.266 A:middle
layout tag.

00:15:27.896 --> 00:15:31.766 A:middle
And then an AV audio
format using this layout.

00:15:32.516 --> 00:15:36.806 A:middle
And then you make a connection
from the environment node

00:15:36.906 --> 00:15:39.766 A:middle
to the output node
using this format.

00:15:41.236 --> 00:15:43.606 A:middle
The second step is
exactly the same,

00:15:43.846 --> 00:15:46.886 A:middle
propagating your content
format between the connection

00:15:47.466 --> 00:15:49.446 A:middle
from player to the
environment node.

00:15:50.536 --> 00:15:54.706 A:middle
So we open the file for reading
and use its processing format

00:15:55.206 --> 00:15:57.976 A:middle
to make a connection from the
player to the environment.

00:15:58.576 --> 00:16:03.676 A:middle
And the next thing here is
to set a rendering algorithm



00:15:58.576 --> 00:16:03.676 A:middle
And the next thing here is
to set a rendering algorithm

00:16:03.676 --> 00:16:08.176 A:middle
on the player to one which
supports multichannel rendering.

00:16:09.456 --> 00:16:11.946 A:middle
This rendering algorithm is one

00:16:11.946 --> 00:16:14.396 A:middle
of the 3D mixing
protocol properties

00:16:14.436 --> 00:16:17.316 A:middle
that we just saw a
few minutes back,

00:16:17.316 --> 00:16:19.806 A:middle
and this will tell
the environment node

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:22.996 A:middle
that the corresponding
source is requesting a

00:16:22.996 --> 00:16:24.386 A:middle
multichannel rendering.

00:16:24.916 --> 00:16:28.246 A:middle
And then the usual stuff.

00:16:28.326 --> 00:16:32.696 A:middle
You schedule your file on the
player, you start your engine

00:16:32.696 --> 00:16:35.776 A:middle
and the player, and then your
content will be spatialized

00:16:35.926 --> 00:16:37.666 A:middle
by the environment node.

00:16:41.246 --> 00:16:46.786 A:middle
Okay. So this was
AVAudioEngine as it existed

00:16:46.946 --> 00:16:49.526 A:middle
in iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite.

00:16:50.726 --> 00:16:52.596 A:middle
Now on to the more
exciting stuff.

00:16:53.406 --> 00:16:54.916 A:middle
What's new for this year?

00:16:55.296 --> 00:17:00.676 A:middle
We have three main new features.



00:16:55.296 --> 00:17:00.676 A:middle
We have three main new features.

00:17:01.676 --> 00:17:03.936 A:middle
First is the splitting support,

00:17:04.215 --> 00:17:06.606 A:middle
which I will be talking
about in a minute.

00:17:07.616 --> 00:17:11.006 A:middle
Second is the audio
format conversion support,

00:17:11.195 --> 00:17:13.506 A:middle
and we have a couple
of new classes here,

00:17:13.836 --> 00:17:16.266 A:middle
the main one being
AVAudioConverter.

00:17:17.776 --> 00:17:20.965 A:middle
And then finally, we have
another new class called

00:17:20.965 --> 00:17:24.826 A:middle
AVAudioSequencer, which supports
play back of MIDI files.

00:17:25.425 --> 00:17:30.126 A:middle
Moving to the splitting support.

00:17:30.886 --> 00:17:34.016 A:middle
Now, let's consider
this sample setup,

00:17:34.796 --> 00:17:37.156 A:middle
which by now I guess
should be pretty familiar.

00:17:38.086 --> 00:17:42.876 A:middle
So in the API that
existed as of last week,

00:17:43.576 --> 00:17:47.226 A:middle
only one-to-one connections
were supported in the engine.

00:17:47.956 --> 00:17:52.566 A:middle
That is the output of any
node could only be connected

00:17:52.566 --> 00:17:54.846 A:middle
to one other node in the engine.

00:17:55.386 --> 00:18:02.526 A:middle
But now, instead of this, we
have added support to do this.



00:17:55.386 --> 00:18:02.526 A:middle
But now, instead of this, we
have added support to do this.

00:18:03.356 --> 00:18:07.796 A:middle
That is to be able to
split output of a node

00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:11.156 A:middle
into multiple paths in
your processing chain.

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:16.356 A:middle
So in this example, the
output of the player is split

00:18:16.416 --> 00:18:17.766 A:middle
into three different paths

00:18:18.216 --> 00:18:20.986 A:middle
and then eventually
connected to the mixer node.

00:18:22.356 --> 00:18:26.686 A:middle
Now, splitting is very useful
in use cases like mixing

00:18:27.046 --> 00:18:32.106 A:middle
where you need to blend in some
amount of wet or process signals

00:18:32.706 --> 00:18:35.976 A:middle
with a dry signal all
driven by the same source.

00:18:37.106 --> 00:18:40.066 A:middle
In this example, the
connection from the player

00:18:40.326 --> 00:18:44.646 A:middle
to the mixer node forms your dry
signal path while the other two

00:18:44.716 --> 00:18:48.196 A:middle
paths going through the
effect nodes forms your wet

00:18:48.266 --> 00:18:48.776 A:middle
signal paths.

00:18:49.626 --> 00:18:53.246 A:middle
And all these three signals are
mixed together using a mixer

00:18:53.246 --> 00:18:56.426 A:middle
node to give you the mix.

00:18:56.616 --> 00:18:59.616 A:middle
Now, note that when you
split the output of a node,



00:19:00.066 --> 00:19:04.026 A:middle
the entire output is actually
rendered through multiple paths,

00:19:04.636 --> 00:19:07.626 A:middle
and there is no splitting
of channels involved.

00:19:10.556 --> 00:19:14.926 A:middle
Now let's see in code how
to set these connections up.

00:19:16.766 --> 00:19:19.876 A:middle
As you can see, the
player is connected

00:19:19.876 --> 00:19:21.186 A:middle
to three different nodes.

00:19:22.486 --> 00:19:26.236 A:middle
We will call these as
connection points represented

00:19:26.526 --> 00:19:29.586 A:middle
by a very simple new
class called AV audio

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:30.546 A:middle
connection point.

00:19:30.546 --> 00:19:36.656 A:middle
The first thing to do
is to create an array

00:19:36.656 --> 00:19:39.486 A:middle
of connection points that
you want your player node

00:19:39.486 --> 00:19:40.396 A:middle
to be connected to.

00:19:41.156 --> 00:19:45.776 A:middle
So in this example, we want
connections to the input bus:

00:19:45.846 --> 00:19:51.886 A:middle
0 of the two effects and input
bus: 1 of the mixer node.

00:19:53.606 --> 00:19:56.926 A:middle
Then you use the new
connection API we have

00:19:57.336 --> 00:20:00.216 A:middle
to connect the player to
these connection points.



00:19:57.336 --> 00:20:00.216 A:middle
to connect the player to
these connection points.

00:20:00.856 --> 00:20:04.866 A:middle
And that's it, so you are set
up for the split connections.

00:20:05.266 --> 00:20:08.586 A:middle
So you move on and make
your other connections

00:20:08.586 --> 00:20:13.976 A:middle
in the engine as you need.

00:20:14.066 --> 00:20:16.786 A:middle
Now let's revisit the
AVAudioMixing protocol

00:20:16.786 --> 00:20:18.736 A:middle
that we discussed sometime back

00:20:18.736 --> 00:20:22.716 A:middle
and see how it affects
splitting use case.

00:20:23.176 --> 00:20:26.256 A:middle
Assume we have a player
node whose output is split

00:20:26.256 --> 00:20:27.956 A:middle
into two different paths,

00:20:27.956 --> 00:20:30.606 A:middle
going through the effect
nodes to a mixer node.

00:20:31.906 --> 00:20:35.776 A:middle
Now, suppose you set a
property on the player node.

00:20:36.326 --> 00:20:38.776 A:middle
In this example,
say you set volume.

00:20:38.776 --> 00:20:44.906 A:middle
Now, at this point, the
property will take effect on all

00:20:44.906 --> 00:20:49.086 A:middle
of its existing mixer
connections, so in this example,

00:20:49.266 --> 00:20:52.066 A:middle
both input bus: 0 and input bus:

00:20:52.066 --> 00:20:58.466 A:middle
1 of the mixer node
get a volume of .5.

00:20:58.676 --> 00:21:02.426 A:middle
But if you wanted to
overwrite any of the properties



00:20:58.676 --> 00:21:02.426 A:middle
But if you wanted to
overwrite any of the properties

00:21:02.496 --> 00:21:04.306 A:middle
on a particular mixer
connection,

00:21:04.576 --> 00:21:05.776 A:middle
you could still do that.

00:21:06.386 --> 00:21:10.066 A:middle
And the way to do it is
using our new class called

00:21:10.066 --> 00:21:11.936 A:middle
AVAudioMixing destination.

00:21:13.196 --> 00:21:14.876 A:middle
So you query the player node

00:21:15.346 --> 00:21:18.396 A:middle
to give you the destination
object corresponding

00:21:18.456 --> 00:21:19.956 A:middle
to the mixer that you want,

00:21:20.756 --> 00:21:23.656 A:middle
and you then set a
property on that object.

00:21:24.486 --> 00:21:28.086 A:middle
So in this example, we
are overwriting the volume

00:21:28.266 --> 00:21:33.606 A:middle
on mixer input bus: 0 to .8.

00:21:33.886 --> 00:21:39.076 A:middle
Now, okay, so similarly, you can
also overwrite the properties

00:21:39.146 --> 00:21:43.476 A:middle
on the other mixer
connection as well.

00:21:43.686 --> 00:21:45.716 A:middle
Now, let's see what
happens in a disconnection.

00:21:46.826 --> 00:21:49.446 A:middle
Suppose you disconnect
the effect

00:21:49.756 --> 00:21:51.786 A:middle
to mixer input bus:
1 connection.

00:21:52.896 --> 00:21:57.466 A:middle
Now, note that the settings
that you may have overwritten

00:21:57.466 --> 00:21:59.806 A:middle
on that particular mixer
connection will not

00:21:59.806 --> 00:22:00.466 A:middle
be preserved.



00:21:59.806 --> 00:22:00.466 A:middle
be preserved.

00:22:01.126 --> 00:22:05.536 A:middle
Hence, the state of mixing
settings will look like this.

00:22:06.036 --> 00:22:09.746 A:middle
The player's mixing
settings remain intact,

00:22:09.746 --> 00:22:13.826 A:middle
and the other connection that is
active will also have its mixing

00:22:13.826 --> 00:22:15.586 A:middle
settings intact.

00:22:17.236 --> 00:22:20.536 A:middle
Now, if you end up making
the connection back again

00:22:20.736 --> 00:22:25.076 A:middle
to mixer input bus: 1, since
the earliest settings were not

00:22:25.166 --> 00:22:29.226 A:middle
preserved, the base settings off
the player node will now take

00:22:29.226 --> 00:22:30.836 A:middle
effect in this new connection.

00:22:32.136 --> 00:22:36.326 A:middle
So hence, the volume of input
bus: 1 will again be set

00:22:36.386 --> 00:22:39.416 A:middle
to .5 based on the
player's mixing settings.

00:22:39.946 --> 00:22:45.736 A:middle
So to summarize, when a
source node is connected

00:22:45.806 --> 00:22:50.676 A:middle
to multiple mixers, the
properties that you set

00:22:50.676 --> 00:22:53.316 A:middle
on the source node
will be applied to all

00:22:53.316 --> 00:22:56.646 A:middle
of its existing mixer
connections as well

00:22:56.646 --> 00:22:59.686 A:middle
as any new mixer
connection that you make.



00:23:00.286 --> 00:23:02.436 A:middle
And the properties

00:23:02.436 --> 00:23:05.786 A:middle
on the individual mixer
connections can be overwritten

00:23:05.786 --> 00:23:09.466 A:middle
if you want to, but remember
that they will not be preserved

00:23:09.656 --> 00:23:10.926 A:middle
on any disconnections.

00:23:14.536 --> 00:23:16.686 A:middle
Final words on the
splitting support.

00:23:16.686 --> 00:23:20.656 A:middle
The engine supports
splitting of any node

00:23:20.986 --> 00:23:24.796 A:middle
in the processing graph,
provided you adhere

00:23:24.896 --> 00:23:26.156 A:middle
to a couple of restrictions.

00:23:27.446 --> 00:23:31.656 A:middle
Now, starting from the node
whose output is split till the

00:23:31.656 --> 00:23:36.956 A:middle
mixer where all the parts
terminate, you cannot have any

00:23:36.956 --> 00:23:38.176 A:middle
of the time effect nodes.

00:23:38.576 --> 00:23:41.826 A:middle
That is you cannot have
speed and time pitch.

00:23:42.386 --> 00:23:45.946 A:middle
Nor can you have any
rate conversions.

00:23:47.276 --> 00:23:51.086 A:middle
So in other words,
all the split parts

00:23:51.446 --> 00:23:55.146 A:middle
from the base node should be
rendering at the same rate

00:23:55.426 --> 00:23:57.136 A:middle
until they reach a common mixer.

00:23:57.136 --> 00:24:01.096 A:middle
So if you stick to
these restrictions,



00:23:57.136 --> 00:24:01.096 A:middle
So if you stick to
these restrictions,

00:24:01.256 --> 00:24:04.206 A:middle
then you could split
the output of any node

00:24:04.356 --> 00:24:07.466 A:middle
in the engine into
multiple parts.

00:24:10.386 --> 00:24:15.596 A:middle
Okay. So now moving on to the
second new feature we have

00:24:16.106 --> 00:24:18.936 A:middle
for this year, audio
format conversion support.

00:24:20.096 --> 00:24:22.066 A:middle
So we have a couple
of new classes here,

00:24:22.156 --> 00:24:25.936 A:middle
AVAudioCompressedBuffer,
and AV Audio Converter.

00:24:26.566 --> 00:24:32.046 A:middle
Now, in the API that
existed as of last week,

00:24:32.346 --> 00:24:36.006 A:middle
we have an AVAudioBuffer and one

00:24:36.006 --> 00:24:38.826 A:middle
of its subclasses
called AVAudioPCMBuffer,

00:24:39.826 --> 00:24:41.086 A:middle
and as the name suggests,

00:24:41.396 --> 00:24:44.516 A:middle
the PCM buffer holds
uncompressed audio data,

00:24:45.386 --> 00:24:47.756 A:middle
and the data flow
through the engine is

00:24:47.756 --> 00:24:49.386 A:middle
in the form of PCM buffers.

00:24:51.046 --> 00:24:53.686 A:middle
Now, starting this year,
we have another subclass

00:24:53.686 --> 00:24:57.366 A:middle
of AVAudioBuffer called
AVAudioCompressedBuffer,

00:24:58.256 --> 00:25:00.716 A:middle
and this holds compressed
audio data.



00:24:58.256 --> 00:25:00.716 A:middle
and this holds compressed
audio data.

00:25:02.026 --> 00:25:06.246 A:middle
And this can be used with
the new class we have called

00:25:06.246 --> 00:25:09.586 A:middle
AVAudioConverter that
I will talk about next.

00:25:12.876 --> 00:25:15.766 A:middle
AVAudioConverter is
a new utility class,

00:25:16.286 --> 00:25:18.346 A:middle
and it's a higher-level
equivalent

00:25:18.566 --> 00:25:22.586 A:middle
for our audio converter from
the audio toolbox framework.

00:25:23.896 --> 00:25:28.406 A:middle
This supports all audio format
conversion, so you could convert

00:25:28.466 --> 00:25:32.946 A:middle
from PCM to PCM format while
changing, say, integer to float,

00:25:33.296 --> 00:25:36.046 A:middle
bit depth, sample
rate, et cetera.

00:25:36.676 --> 00:25:41.166 A:middle
Or you could convert between
PCM and compressed format

00:25:41.406 --> 00:25:45.216 A:middle
that is you can use it for
encoding and decoding purposes.

00:25:45.826 --> 00:25:50.156 A:middle
And AVAudioConverter can
be used in conjunction

00:25:50.156 --> 00:25:56.396 A:middle
with AVAudioEngine, as we
will see in an example.

00:25:56.396 --> 00:26:00.546 A:middle
Okay. So suppose you have your
engine set up for a playback.



00:25:56.396 --> 00:26:00.546 A:middle
Okay. So suppose you have your
engine set up for a playback.

00:26:00.626 --> 00:26:03.146 A:middle
So we have a player
node connected

00:26:03.186 --> 00:26:04.996 A:middle
to an effect node
and an output node.

00:26:06.366 --> 00:26:09.376 A:middle
And suppose you have a
compressed audio stream

00:26:09.446 --> 00:26:10.576 A:middle
coming in.

00:26:11.816 --> 00:26:15.726 A:middle
Now, we know that the data
flow through the engine is

00:26:15.726 --> 00:26:17.966 A:middle
in the form of PCM buffers.

00:26:18.916 --> 00:26:22.366 A:middle
So now you could use
an AVAudioConverter

00:26:22.716 --> 00:26:27.046 A:middle
to convert your input compressed
stream into PCM buffers,

00:26:27.316 --> 00:26:30.396 A:middle
and then you can use
these buffers to schedule

00:26:30.396 --> 00:26:33.596 A:middle
on the player node, hence
the playback can happen

00:26:33.756 --> 00:26:34.486 A:middle
through the engine.

00:26:35.046 --> 00:26:41.666 A:middle
Now let's consider a
code example and see how

00:26:41.666 --> 00:26:44.656 A:middle
to use AVAudioConverter
for encoding purposes.

00:26:45.906 --> 00:26:48.776 A:middle
Now, here we want to
convert from a PCM

00:26:49.076 --> 00:26:50.776 A:middle
to an ASC compressed format.

00:26:51.386 --> 00:26:55.406 A:middle
So the first thing to
do is define your input

00:26:55.546 --> 00:26:56.736 A:middle
as well as output format.

00:26:57.486 --> 00:27:01.256 A:middle
So here I have an input
format which is a PCM format,



00:26:57.486 --> 00:27:01.256 A:middle
So here I have an input
format which is a PCM format,

00:27:01.836 --> 00:27:04.956 A:middle
and I have an output format,

00:27:05.136 --> 00:27:10.446 A:middle
which is a compressed
ASC format.

00:27:10.566 --> 00:27:14.826 A:middle
Next you create an
AVAudioConverter and asking it

00:27:15.006 --> 00:27:18.526 A:middle
to convert from your input
to the output format.

00:27:20.136 --> 00:27:22.646 A:middle
Then you create your
audio buffers.

00:27:23.596 --> 00:27:26.206 A:middle
The input buffer in this
case is a PCM buffer,

00:27:26.206 --> 00:27:31.086 A:middle
and the output buffer is our
new AVAudioCompressedBuffer

00:27:31.526 --> 00:27:33.826 A:middle
in the ASC format.

00:27:35.936 --> 00:27:37.746 A:middle
The next thing to do is

00:27:37.776 --> 00:27:43.226 A:middle
to define something called
AVAudioConverter input block.

00:27:43.226 --> 00:27:46.886 A:middle
This is the block that the
converter will call whenever it

00:27:46.886 --> 00:27:47.926 A:middle
needs input data.

00:27:49.446 --> 00:27:51.876 A:middle
So there are a couple of things
that you need to do here.

00:27:53.086 --> 00:27:55.636 A:middle
First, you need to
inform the converter

00:27:55.976 --> 00:27:57.826 A:middle
about the status of your input.

00:27:58.816 --> 00:28:01.026 A:middle
So suppose when the
block gets called,



00:27:58.816 --> 00:28:01.026 A:middle
So suppose when the
block gets called,

00:28:01.336 --> 00:28:03.596 A:middle
you do not have any
input data available.

00:28:04.386 --> 00:28:07.806 A:middle
So at that point, you
can say no data now

00:28:08.206 --> 00:28:10.486 A:middle
and return a nil
buffer to the converter.

00:28:11.066 --> 00:28:14.606 A:middle
Now, suppose you have
reached end of stream,

00:28:15.116 --> 00:28:18.096 A:middle
so you can inform the converter
saying it's end of stream

00:28:18.296 --> 00:28:21.276 A:middle
and again return a nil buffer.

00:28:22.226 --> 00:28:23.986 A:middle
Otherwise, in the normal cases,

00:28:24.156 --> 00:28:27.356 A:middle
you can see that you
do have data, and fill

00:28:27.356 --> 00:28:33.086 A:middle
and return your input
buffer to the converter.

00:28:33.196 --> 00:28:35.096 A:middle
Now, this is the
main conversion loop.

00:28:36.256 --> 00:28:39.896 A:middle
In every operation of this loop,
we are asking the converter

00:28:40.116 --> 00:28:42.446 A:middle
to produce one output
buffer of data,

00:28:43.236 --> 00:28:46.306 A:middle
and we are providing the input
block that we just defined

00:28:46.646 --> 00:28:49.956 A:middle
to the converter so that it
can be called by the converter

00:28:50.056 --> 00:28:52.376 A:middle
as many times as it needs input.

00:28:52.846 --> 00:28:57.476 A:middle
Now, the converter will
also return your status,

00:28:57.536 --> 00:29:00.616 A:middle
which you can check to see
the state of conversion.



00:28:57.536 --> 00:29:00.616 A:middle
which you can check to see
the state of conversion.

00:29:01.216 --> 00:29:03.836 A:middle
So if the converter
says it's end of stream

00:29:04.046 --> 00:29:06.146 A:middle
or if it says there
was an error,

00:29:06.146 --> 00:29:09.956 A:middle
you could handle it accordingly.

00:29:09.956 --> 00:29:11.696 A:middle
Otherwise, in the normal cases,

00:29:11.866 --> 00:29:15.686 A:middle
every iteration will provide
you one output buffer of data.

00:29:19.696 --> 00:29:23.116 A:middle
Okay. So coming to
our final new class

00:29:23.116 --> 00:29:26.276 A:middle
for this year, AVAudioSequencer.

00:29:30.036 --> 00:29:33.146 A:middle
This supports playback
of MIDI files,

00:29:33.696 --> 00:29:39.326 A:middle
and AVAudioSequencer is
associated with an AVAudioEngine

00:29:39.326 --> 00:29:41.876 A:middle
at the time of instantiation.

00:29:42.346 --> 00:29:48.106 A:middle
And the sequencer is responsible
for sending MIDI events

00:29:48.516 --> 00:29:52.266 A:middle
to the instrument nodes that you
may have attached in the engine.

00:29:52.996 --> 00:29:56.436 A:middle
Now, the example for instrument
nodes, audio samplers,

00:29:56.556 --> 00:29:58.626 A:middle
MIDI events et cetera.



00:30:01.486 --> 00:30:03.356 A:middle
Now let's look at
a sample setup.

00:30:04.036 --> 00:30:06.416 A:middle
Suppose you have your
AVAudioEngine set

00:30:06.416 --> 00:30:09.766 A:middle
up with an instrument node
connected to a mixer node

00:30:10.036 --> 00:30:13.636 A:middle
and to the output node.

00:30:13.856 --> 00:30:16.586 A:middle
You can now create
an AVAudioSequencer

00:30:16.586 --> 00:30:19.056 A:middle
and associate it
with this engine.

00:30:19.616 --> 00:30:24.746 A:middle
And then, when you start your
sequencer and start your engine,

00:30:25.026 --> 00:30:29.626 A:middle
the sequencer will automatically
discover the first instrument

00:30:29.626 --> 00:30:32.816 A:middle
node in the engine and
start sending MIDI events

00:30:32.966 --> 00:30:34.846 A:middle
to that instrument node.

00:30:35.396 --> 00:30:39.586 A:middle
And in code, it looks like this.

00:30:40.426 --> 00:30:42.866 A:middle
So the first part is
your engine setup,

00:30:42.956 --> 00:30:44.596 A:middle
which is outside
of the sequencer.

00:30:45.576 --> 00:30:49.556 A:middle
So here we have an instrument
node that is a sampler,

00:30:50.176 --> 00:30:53.536 A:middle
so you make your required
connections in the engine,

00:30:54.686 --> 00:30:56.876 A:middle
and then you start your engine.

00:30:58.026 --> 00:31:01.126 A:middle
Now, at this point, there
will be no audio playback



00:30:58.026 --> 00:31:01.126 A:middle
Now, at this point, there
will be no audio playback

00:31:01.266 --> 00:31:02.876 A:middle
because there isn't anything

00:31:02.876 --> 00:31:05.146 A:middle
that is driving the
instrument node.

00:31:06.576 --> 00:31:10.736 A:middle
Then next you create your
sequencer and associate it

00:31:10.956 --> 00:31:12.946 A:middle
with the engine that
you just configured.

00:31:13.716 --> 00:31:17.666 A:middle
You load your MIDI file
onto the sequencer.

00:31:18.316 --> 00:31:21.176 A:middle
And then you can
start your sequencer.

00:31:21.666 --> 00:31:25.716 A:middle
So at this point, the sequencer
will implicitly discover your

00:31:25.716 --> 00:31:28.776 A:middle
sampler node that you have
attached in the engine

00:31:29.016 --> 00:31:31.896 A:middle
and start sending MIDI
events to the sampler node.

00:31:32.306 --> 00:31:35.706 A:middle
And hence, your audio
playback will start.

00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:41.606 A:middle
Now, suppose you had multiple
tracks in your MIDI file.

00:31:43.066 --> 00:31:45.996 A:middle
Now, the default behavior
of the sequencer is

00:31:45.996 --> 00:31:49.836 A:middle
to send all the tracks to
the first instrument node

00:31:50.006 --> 00:31:53.086 A:middle
that it finds in the engine.

00:31:53.226 --> 00:31:56.296 A:middle
But in case you wanted
to direct your tracks

00:31:56.566 --> 00:31:58.446 A:middle
to the individual
instrument nodes,

00:31:59.386 --> 00:32:02.446 A:middle
you can do that with
just a few lines of code.



00:31:59.386 --> 00:32:02.446 A:middle
you can do that with
just a few lines of code.

00:32:02.966 --> 00:32:06.996 A:middle
Now, the creation and
setting up of the engine

00:32:06.996 --> 00:32:09.346 A:middle
in the sequencer is
the same as earlier.

00:32:09.716 --> 00:32:13.166 A:middle
The only additional thing that
you need to do is you need

00:32:13.166 --> 00:32:15.156 A:middle
to get the tracks
from your sequencer

00:32:15.776 --> 00:32:18.746 A:middle
and set the destination
for each of your tracks

00:32:19.096 --> 00:32:21.606 A:middle
to the instrument
node that you want.

00:32:25.816 --> 00:32:27.826 A:middle
Final few words on
the sequencer.

00:32:28.636 --> 00:32:31.916 A:middle
The sequencer has its own
set of transport controls

00:32:32.226 --> 00:32:36.116 A:middle
for the MIDI events, unlike the
transport controls on the engine

00:32:36.266 --> 00:32:38.136 A:middle
that control the flow of audio.

00:32:39.246 --> 00:32:42.616 A:middle
So here you can prepare
the sequencer for playback,

00:32:42.756 --> 00:32:44.826 A:middle
which basically does prerolling.

00:32:45.626 --> 00:32:47.836 A:middle
You can start/stop
the MIDI events.

00:32:48.866 --> 00:32:51.676 A:middle
You can set the playback
position of the MIDI events

00:32:51.736 --> 00:32:53.656 A:middle
in terms of seconds or beats.

00:32:54.736 --> 00:32:56.976 A:middle
And also, you can
set the playback rate

00:32:57.276 --> 00:32:58.266 A:middle
of the MIDI events.



00:33:02.176 --> 00:33:06.036 A:middle
Okay. So with that, we
have seen the new features

00:33:06.036 --> 00:33:10.146 A:middle
in AVAudioEngine for this
year's iOS and OS X releases.

00:33:10.636 --> 00:33:12.966 A:middle
Now I would like to
show you a quick demo

00:33:13.236 --> 00:33:15.636 A:middle
to see these new
features in action.

00:33:16.236 --> 00:33:20.136 A:middle
And for that, I would like to
invite Torrey onto the stage

00:33:20.826 --> 00:33:23.466 A:middle
to help me with the demo.

00:33:24.516 --> 00:33:26.676 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:33:27.176 --> 00:33:27.696 A:middle
Okay.

00:33:33.106 --> 00:33:35.566 A:middle
So in this demo, we
have an AVAudioEngine

00:33:35.596 --> 00:33:39.776 A:middle
and an AVAudioSequencer that
is associated with this engine.

00:33:41.116 --> 00:33:44.826 A:middle
So in the engine, we have an
instrument node that you can see

00:33:44.826 --> 00:33:50.666 A:middle
at the top whose output is split
into three different paths.

00:33:50.666 --> 00:33:54.216 A:middle
One of the paths is directly
connected to the main mixer node

00:33:54.366 --> 00:33:58.226 A:middle
in the engine, and two of
the other paths are connected

00:33:58.706 --> 00:34:04.446 A:middle
through two different effects,
and then to the main mixer.



00:33:58.706 --> 00:34:04.446 A:middle
through two different effects,
and then to the main mixer.

00:34:04.446 --> 00:34:07.146 A:middle
Now, using the AVAudioMixing
protocol properties we

00:34:07.146 --> 00:34:11.275 A:middle
discussed, there are
volume controls on each

00:34:11.275 --> 00:34:13.005 A:middle
of these mixer input buses.

00:34:13.786 --> 00:34:16.666 A:middle
So the slightest that you
see for distortion volume,

00:34:16.766 --> 00:34:20.735 A:middle
direct volume, and reverb
volume are the volume controls

00:34:20.956 --> 00:34:22.606 A:middle
and controls through
mixing protocol.

00:34:24.005 --> 00:34:28.226 A:middle
Now, at the top, in
the light gray box,

00:34:28.226 --> 00:34:31.666 A:middle
you can see this transport
controls for the sequencer.

00:34:32.436 --> 00:34:36.306 A:middle
You can see that we have a play
stop control on the sequencer

00:34:36.485 --> 00:34:40.186 A:middle
as well as sliders for
setting the playback position

00:34:40.585 --> 00:34:43.306 A:middle
and the playback
rate of the MIDIs.

00:34:44.545 --> 00:34:47.596 A:middle
There is also a master
volume on the main mixer

00:34:47.735 --> 00:34:52.036 A:middle
to control the volume
of your mix.

00:34:52.916 --> 00:34:57.986 A:middle
Now let's go ahead and
start the sequencer [music].

00:34:57.986 --> 00:35:01.786 A:middle
So at this point, the
MIDI events are being sent



00:34:57.986 --> 00:35:01.786 A:middle
So at this point, the
MIDI events are being sent

00:35:02.006 --> 00:35:06.126 A:middle
to the instrument node
that is in the engine.

00:35:06.126 --> 00:35:12.056 A:middle
You can dynamically change
the position of playback

00:35:14.086 --> 00:35:17.766 A:middle
of the MIDI events
and the playback rate.

00:35:17.836 --> 00:35:28.496 A:middle
Using the volume controls, you
can blend in the required amount

00:35:28.496 --> 00:35:30.736 A:middle
of effects that you
want in your mix.

00:35:30.736 --> 00:35:34.476 A:middle
You could increase
the distortion volume.

00:35:35.656 --> 00:35:41.296 A:middle
Or the reverb volume.

00:35:41.376 --> 00:35:49.896 A:middle
So effectively, you can play
around with these volumes

00:35:49.996 --> 00:35:52.586 A:middle
and create the mix
that you desire.

00:35:52.586 --> 00:35:58.066 A:middle
And finally, using the master
volume on the mixer node,

00:35:58.456 --> 00:36:08.856 A:middle
you could control the volume of
the overall mix [audio fading].



00:35:58.456 --> 00:36:08.856 A:middle
you could control the volume of
the overall mix [audio fading].

00:36:09.396 --> 00:36:12.456 A:middle
Okay. So that was a
demo of the new features

00:36:12.456 --> 00:36:13.976 A:middle
that we just discussed.

00:36:15.516 --> 00:36:20.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:36:21.046 --> 00:36:24.126 A:middle
So the sample code for this demo
should be available sometime

00:36:24.126 --> 00:36:26.886 A:middle
later this year.

00:36:27.086 --> 00:36:31.276 A:middle
Now final words on what we
saw today in AVAudioEngine.

00:36:32.176 --> 00:36:37.046 A:middle
We saw a recap, and we reviewed
how to handle multichannel audio

00:36:37.046 --> 00:36:41.166 A:middle
with AVAudioEngine, and then
we saw three new features

00:36:41.326 --> 00:36:45.466 A:middle
for this year -- first,
splitting support; second,

00:36:45.586 --> 00:36:47.426 A:middle
audio format conversion support,

00:36:47.746 --> 00:36:53.016 A:middle
the main class being
AVAudioConverter; and finally,

00:36:53.016 --> 00:36:55.946 A:middle
we saw another new class
called AVAudioSequencer

00:36:56.196 --> 00:36:58.346 A:middle
that supports playback
of MIDI files.

00:36:59.726 --> 00:37:02.716 A:middle
I hope you will use these
new features in your apps



00:36:59.726 --> 00:37:02.716 A:middle
I hope you will use these
new features in your apps

00:37:03.196 --> 00:37:04.706 A:middle
and provide us feedback.

00:37:05.376 --> 00:37:05.726 A:middle
Thank you.

00:37:06.646 --> 00:37:08.646 A:middle
Over to Torrey to
take it from here.

00:37:08.836 --> 00:37:09.406 A:middle
Thanks, Torrey.

00:37:10.516 --> 00:37:18.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:37:19.046 --> 00:37:19.756 A:middle
Thanks, Akshatha.

00:37:20.416 --> 00:37:21.356 A:middle
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:37:21.916 --> 00:37:24.106 A:middle
I'm Torrey, and let's
keep it rolling

00:37:24.106 --> 00:37:25.876 A:middle
with Inter-Device
Audio Mode for iOS.

00:37:26.966 --> 00:37:29.066 A:middle
It's no secret that
the iPad is one

00:37:29.066 --> 00:37:31.536 A:middle
of the most versatile musical
instruments on the planet,

00:37:31.536 --> 00:37:33.616 A:middle
and that's primarily
thanks to all of you-all,

00:37:34.256 --> 00:37:37.896 A:middle
with digital audio workstation
apps, synthesizer apps,

00:37:37.896 --> 00:37:39.956 A:middle
drum machine apps, sound toys.

00:37:39.956 --> 00:37:41.946 A:middle
There's an endless
amount of audio content

00:37:41.946 --> 00:37:43.566 A:middle
that you can generate
with the same device.

00:37:44.326 --> 00:37:47.376 A:middle
So how do you get that audio
content from your iOS device

00:37:47.446 --> 00:37:50.216 A:middle
into your project that you
are working on on your Mac?

00:37:51.036 --> 00:37:55.076 A:middle
Well, you could plug in a
cable into the headphone jack,

00:37:55.076 --> 00:37:57.596 A:middle
run that into an audio
breakout box that's connected

00:37:57.596 --> 00:38:00.166 A:middle
to your Mac, but that
would be digital to analog



00:37:57.596 --> 00:38:00.166 A:middle
to your Mac, but that
would be digital to analog

00:38:00.166 --> 00:38:01.506 A:middle
and back again to digital.

00:38:01.506 --> 00:38:03.866 A:middle
I am sure that we can all
agree that's less than ideal.

00:38:04.426 --> 00:38:07.536 A:middle
So to record audio
digitally from an iOS device,

00:38:08.676 --> 00:38:11.466 A:middle
we attach a lightning-to-USB
adapter.

00:38:11.936 --> 00:38:15.546 A:middle
We attach a USB audio
class-compliant interface that's

00:38:15.546 --> 00:38:19.406 A:middle
capable of doing digital audio
output; a digital audio cable;

00:38:19.796 --> 00:38:21.616 A:middle
another interface that's capable

00:38:21.616 --> 00:38:23.456 A:middle
of receiving digital
audio input;

00:38:23.456 --> 00:38:25.316 A:middle
and we attach that to the Mac.

00:38:26.116 --> 00:38:28.456 A:middle
It works. But it's
a lot of hardware.

00:38:29.506 --> 00:38:31.546 A:middle
There's also third-party
software that attempts

00:38:31.546 --> 00:38:36.006 A:middle
to solve this same problem,
which is great if your app uses

00:38:36.006 --> 00:38:38.756 A:middle
that or if your favorite
app uses that.

00:38:39.516 --> 00:38:41.636 A:middle
But wouldn't it be
great if you didn't have

00:38:41.666 --> 00:38:45.686 A:middle
to use any extra hardware or
install any extra software

00:38:45.686 --> 00:38:49.306 A:middle
and you could just record audio
digitally through the darn cable

00:38:49.306 --> 00:38:52.596 A:middle
that came with the darn thing?

00:38:53.136 --> 00:38:54.316 A:middle
Well, drumroll, please.

00:38:55.906 --> 00:39:00.406 A:middle
Oh, great latency
on that [laughter].



00:38:55.906 --> 00:39:00.406 A:middle
Oh, great latency
on that [laughter].

00:39:01.176 --> 00:39:04.126 A:middle
Introducing Inter-Device
Audio Mode,

00:39:04.806 --> 00:39:07.566 A:middle
or as we like to call
it internally, IDAM.

00:39:07.916 --> 00:39:12.686 A:middle
IDAM allows you to record
audio digitally through the USB

00:39:12.686 --> 00:39:15.356 A:middle
to lightning cable that
came with your device.

00:39:16.076 --> 00:39:19.336 A:middle
It records at a hardware
audio stream format

00:39:19.336 --> 00:39:22.976 A:middle
of two channel 24-bit at
48 kilohertz sample rate,

00:39:23.396 --> 00:39:27.716 A:middle
and it is a USB 2.0 audio
class-compliant implementation

00:39:27.716 --> 00:39:28.456 A:middle
from end to end.

00:39:29.186 --> 00:39:31.536 A:middle
What that means is
on the Mac side,

00:39:31.816 --> 00:39:34.876 A:middle
you are using the class
Mac USB audio driver.

00:39:35.086 --> 00:39:37.986 A:middle
You will get the same great
performance and low latency

00:39:37.986 --> 00:39:41.566 A:middle
that class-compliant USB
audio devices currently get.

00:39:41.886 --> 00:39:43.966 A:middle
Also, on the iOS side,

00:39:44.176 --> 00:39:48.136 A:middle
the implementation is
USBISOCHRONOUS audio.

00:39:48.446 --> 00:39:50.826 A:middle
That means your bandwidth
is reserved.

00:39:51.286 --> 00:39:55.126 A:middle
If you want to backup
120 gigabytes of data

00:39:55.406 --> 00:39:57.896 A:middle
to your Mac while you are
tapping out a drum beat

00:39:57.896 --> 00:39:59.996 A:middle
and recording it,
you can rest assured

00:39:59.996 --> 00:40:03.436 A:middle
that your audio is not
going to have any artifacts.



00:39:59.996 --> 00:40:03.436 A:middle
that your audio is not
going to have any artifacts.

00:40:04.796 --> 00:40:07.006 A:middle
Next, my no slide.

00:40:07.646 --> 00:40:09.466 A:middle
No additional hardware required.

00:40:09.616 --> 00:40:11.416 A:middle
There's no additional
software required.

00:40:11.416 --> 00:40:13.926 A:middle
You don't need to modify
your OS X application

00:40:14.196 --> 00:40:15.836 A:middle
to take advantage
of this feature.

00:40:16.076 --> 00:40:19.386 A:middle
If your iOS application
already properly adapts

00:40:19.386 --> 00:40:23.646 A:middle
to a two-channel 24-bit
48-kilohertz audio stream

00:40:23.646 --> 00:40:26.346 A:middle
format, you don't have to
modify your iOS application.

00:40:27.126 --> 00:40:29.736 A:middle
And if you get a calendar alert
while you are in the middle

00:40:29.736 --> 00:40:31.376 A:middle
of jamming out a
sample baseline,

00:40:31.506 --> 00:40:33.496 A:middle
that alert is not going
to go out over the USB.

00:40:33.546 --> 00:40:36.606 A:middle
It goes out over the speaker
like it's supposed to.

00:40:37.516 --> 00:40:41.636 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:40:42.136 --> 00:40:45.556 A:middle
Okay. So Inter-Device Audio
Mode, your device can charge

00:40:45.556 --> 00:40:49.316 A:middle
and sync in this mode; however,
photo import, tethering,

00:40:49.356 --> 00:40:52.046 A:middle
and QuickTime screen capture
will be temporarily disabled.

00:40:52.426 --> 00:40:54.316 A:middle
You want those back,
click a button

00:40:54.406 --> 00:40:55.776 A:middle
or just unplug the device.

00:40:56.666 --> 00:40:58.736 A:middle
Torrey, how do I
use it, you may ask?

00:40:59.466 --> 00:41:03.056 A:middle
So we built support directly
into audio MIDI setup.



00:40:59.466 --> 00:41:03.056 A:middle
So we built support directly
into audio MIDI setup.

00:41:03.216 --> 00:41:06.036 A:middle
If you look under the window
menu, you will see a new option,

00:41:06.776 --> 00:41:10.086 A:middle
show iOS device browser,
and if you click that,

00:41:10.086 --> 00:41:11.656 A:middle
you get this fancy-pants view.

00:41:12.206 --> 00:41:14.596 A:middle
It shows you all your
connected iOS devices.

00:41:15.086 --> 00:41:18.166 A:middle
You want to enter or exit
the IDAM configuration,

00:41:18.286 --> 00:41:19.266 A:middle
you click the button.

00:41:20.036 --> 00:41:24.086 A:middle
Now, you can actually embed this
view into your OS X application

00:41:24.086 --> 00:41:26.736 A:middle
if you choose to do so, and I
am going to show you some code

00:41:26.736 --> 00:41:29.376 A:middle
for how to do that,
but before that,

00:41:29.376 --> 00:41:31.106 A:middle
you've guessed it,
it's demo time.

00:41:36.136 --> 00:41:39.236 A:middle
I've got one of these
fancy iPads up here.

00:41:39.436 --> 00:41:40.126 A:middle
All right.

00:41:41.616 --> 00:41:45.956 A:middle
Here on this iPad, I am running
a synthesizer application

00:41:45.956 --> 00:41:46.766 A:middle
called Nave.

00:41:47.066 --> 00:41:48.576 A:middle
I like this application
because some

00:41:48.576 --> 00:41:52.446 A:middle
of the patches you can actually
get a nice touch interface

00:41:52.566 --> 00:41:53.006 A:middle
for it.

00:41:53.626 --> 00:41:55.296 A:middle
You can potentially
do aftertouch with it,

00:41:55.296 --> 00:41:57.306 A:middle
which is something that's
not on every MIDI controller

00:41:57.306 --> 00:41:58.216 A:middle
that you buy on the market.

00:41:58.526 --> 00:42:01.626 A:middle
It's one reason why iPads are
such great musical instruments.



00:41:58.526 --> 00:42:01.626 A:middle
It's one reason why iPads are
such great musical instruments.

00:42:02.316 --> 00:42:04.926 A:middle
So I selected a patch here
that sounds like this.

00:42:05.516 --> 00:42:11.556 A:middle
[ Music ]

00:42:12.056 --> 00:42:13.516 A:middle
I like those sounds, so
I want to record them

00:42:13.516 --> 00:42:16.356 A:middle
into a hip hop project that
I am working on on the Mac.

00:42:16.906 --> 00:42:22.026 A:middle
So let's move over to the Mac,

00:42:26.346 --> 00:42:29.646 A:middle
okay here on the Mac I already
have audio MIDI setup running.

00:42:29.646 --> 00:42:35.536 A:middle
I am going to go to the window
menu, show iOS device browser,

00:42:35.536 --> 00:42:39.136 A:middle
and I can see I currently
have no connected iOS devices.

00:42:39.596 --> 00:42:42.066 A:middle
So I will plug in my iPad.

00:42:43.766 --> 00:42:45.286 A:middle
It shows up immediately.

00:42:46.046 --> 00:42:48.016 A:middle
Blink and you miss
it, but click Enable,

00:42:48.916 --> 00:42:52.826 A:middle
and now you've got an extra
audio device right here.

00:42:53.206 --> 00:42:54.986 A:middle
Yes, Logic, we will
get to you shortly.

00:42:55.816 --> 00:42:58.556 A:middle
You can see there's a
two-channel input audio device

00:42:58.616 --> 00:42:59.526 A:middle
that's been added here.

00:42:59.576 --> 00:43:02.746 A:middle
And we do want to use this in
my Logic project, so I am going



00:42:59.576 --> 00:43:02.746 A:middle
And we do want to use this in
my Logic project, so I am going

00:43:02.746 --> 00:43:04.126 A:middle
to go ahead and say Use Here.

00:43:08.516 --> 00:43:10.066 A:middle
Let's bring Logic back up.

00:43:10.896 --> 00:43:11.956 A:middle
All right.

00:43:12.236 --> 00:43:13.636 A:middle
Here is the beat I
have been working on.

00:43:14.516 --> 00:43:20.706 A:middle
[ Music ]

00:43:21.206 --> 00:43:25.396 A:middle
And I want to record in an
audio track here, so I am going

00:43:25.396 --> 00:43:27.666 A:middle
to create a new audio track.

00:43:28.836 --> 00:43:31.746 A:middle
Record monitor that
and record enable.

00:43:32.766 --> 00:43:38.346 A:middle
Bring the volume down a little
bit because it will be at unity.

00:43:38.346 --> 00:43:42.346 A:middle
And now [music] I can hear that
coming directly into my track.

00:43:42.436 --> 00:43:43.976 A:middle
So let's record a piece.

00:43:44.516 --> 00:44:01.946 A:middle
[ Music ]



00:43:44.516 --> 00:44:01.946 A:middle
[ Music ]

00:44:02.446 --> 00:44:07.166 A:middle
And if I play back my
performance [music] the audio's

00:44:07.196 --> 00:44:08.966 A:middle
captured exactly like I expect.

00:44:15.046 --> 00:44:16.036 A:middle
Sick beat, Bro.

00:44:17.516 --> 00:44:23.826 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:44:24.326 --> 00:44:27.046 A:middle
Now, that concludes my demo,
but I am not a professional.

00:44:27.076 --> 00:44:28.346 A:middle
Please try this at home.

00:44:28.346 --> 00:44:29.766 A:middle
It's in your betas right now.

00:44:29.946 --> 00:44:32.026 A:middle
If you find any bugs
with it whatsoever,

00:44:32.026 --> 00:44:35.906 A:middle
just go to bugreport.apple.com,
and file that bug for us.

00:44:36.606 --> 00:44:39.346 A:middle
Okay. So a few last
words about IDAM.

00:44:39.646 --> 00:44:43.026 A:middle
It requires OS X El
Capitan and iOS 9.

00:44:43.646 --> 00:44:45.926 A:middle
It will work on all iPhones
with a lightning connector.

00:44:45.996 --> 00:44:47.496 A:middle
It works on all iPads

00:44:47.496 --> 00:44:51.016 A:middle
with a lightning connector
except our very first iPad mini.

00:44:51.636 --> 00:44:55.816 A:middle
And if you've got a home iPhone,
a work iPhone, a home iPad,

00:44:55.816 --> 00:44:59.156 A:middle
a work iPad, and an iPad for
the kids and the power hubs

00:44:59.156 --> 00:45:02.286 A:middle
to support it, you can plug all
of those in at the same time,



00:44:59.156 --> 00:45:02.286 A:middle
to support it, you can plug all
of those in at the same time,

00:45:02.546 --> 00:45:05.476 A:middle
aggregate them together as a
massive ten-channel input device

00:45:05.476 --> 00:45:06.636 A:middle
if you want to, and record it.

00:45:06.636 --> 00:45:09.916 A:middle
And if you've got USB
ports left over after that,

00:45:09.956 --> 00:45:13.496 A:middle
please point your Safari browser
at store.apple.com [laughter].

00:45:15.516 --> 00:45:20.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:45:21.066 --> 00:45:22.966 A:middle
Okay. I said earlier
that I would tell you how

00:45:23.036 --> 00:45:25.616 A:middle
to embed the view controller
into your OS X application

00:45:25.616 --> 00:45:27.156 A:middle
if you choose to do
that, and I am going

00:45:27.156 --> 00:45:28.436 A:middle
to show you the code
for that now.

00:45:32.376 --> 00:45:35.616 A:middle
This code is pretty boilerplate,
so I took the liberty

00:45:35.616 --> 00:45:36.886 A:middle
of highlighting the
important part,

00:45:36.946 --> 00:45:39.606 A:middle
if you will let your eyes
slide down to the yellow text,

00:45:39.906 --> 00:45:42.646 A:middle
and you will see CA Inter-
Device Audio View Controller.

00:45:43.076 --> 00:45:46.276 A:middle
You just want to create one of
those and then add the subview

00:45:46.276 --> 00:45:47.396 A:middle
to your view container.

00:45:47.996 --> 00:45:51.936 A:middle
As long as I am talking about
new view controllers that are

00:45:51.936 --> 00:45:53.796 A:middle
in CoreAudioKit, I
also wanted to tell you

00:45:53.796 --> 00:45:56.656 A:middle
about a couple more you
might be interested in.

00:45:56.956 --> 00:46:00.776 A:middle
We've also added
CABTLEMIDI window controller.



00:45:56.956 --> 00:46:00.776 A:middle
We've also added
CABTLEMIDI window controller.

00:46:01.436 --> 00:46:05.056 A:middle
This is the UI for configuring
your Bluetooth Low Energy MIDI

00:46:05.056 --> 00:46:07.686 A:middle
devices, it's a feature
that we debuted last year.

00:46:08.166 --> 00:46:11.216 A:middle
It's an NS window controller
subclass, and that view looks

00:46:11.216 --> 00:46:13.956 A:middle
like this, so you can
now embed this directly

00:46:13.956 --> 00:46:18.166 A:middle
into your OS X application
if you choose to do so.

00:46:18.426 --> 00:46:19.306 A:middle
One more for you.

00:46:19.826 --> 00:46:22.716 A:middle
We also have CA Network
Browser Window Controller.

00:46:22.876 --> 00:46:26.866 A:middle
This is the UI for configuring
your Audio Video Bridge

00:46:26.916 --> 00:46:27.696 A:middle
audio devices.

00:46:28.166 --> 00:46:30.106 A:middle
Also an NS window
controller subclass,

00:46:30.106 --> 00:46:36.876 A:middle
and that view looks like this.

00:46:37.086 --> 00:46:40.996 A:middle
Okay. Let's push in the clutch
and switch gears as we talk

00:46:40.996 --> 00:46:43.166 A:middle
about what's new
in AVAudioSession.

00:46:43.716 --> 00:46:46.496 A:middle
So how many of you listen
to podcasts and audio books?

00:46:47.596 --> 00:46:47.956 A:middle
All right.

00:46:47.956 --> 00:46:48.436 A:middle
A lot of you.

00:46:48.746 --> 00:46:50.546 A:middle
How many of you also
use your iPhone

00:46:50.546 --> 00:46:52.026 A:middle
as your primary navigation
device?

00:46:53.046 --> 00:46:55.076 A:middle
A lot of you too.

00:46:55.346 --> 00:46:57.366 A:middle
Okay. So you may have
seen this problem before.

00:46:57.636 --> 00:46:59.636 A:middle
Let's say you are going
to a soul food restaurant

00:46:59.636 --> 00:47:00.576 A:middle
that you've never been to.



00:46:59.636 --> 00:47:00.576 A:middle
that you've never been to.

00:47:01.096 --> 00:47:02.036 A:middle
You are navigating.

00:47:02.036 --> 00:47:03.566 A:middle
Then you are listening
to a podcast.

00:47:03.896 --> 00:47:06.906 A:middle
This podcast is hosted
by podcast personality X,

00:47:07.456 --> 00:47:11.406 A:middle
and they are interviewing your
favorite currently relevant

00:47:11.406 --> 00:47:14.786 A:middle
celebrity Y, and in the
middle of this interview,

00:47:14.986 --> 00:47:17.146 A:middle
the conversation is
getting really juicy

00:47:17.246 --> 00:47:20.766 A:middle
when your navigation pipes
up and says in 500 feet,

00:47:20.876 --> 00:47:23.056 A:middle
keep to the right, followed
by a -- keep to the right.

00:47:24.286 --> 00:47:26.316 A:middle
Then after that you
hear raucous laughter.

00:47:26.316 --> 00:47:28.556 A:middle
Some great joke happened,
and you just missed it.

00:47:28.646 --> 00:47:31.776 A:middle
So you back up the audio, and
you start playing it again,

00:47:31.776 --> 00:47:34.156 A:middle
and just as you get to the
joke, "keep to the right."

00:47:34.816 --> 00:47:41.116 A:middle
You pump your fist and say "I am
having a bad user experience."

00:47:42.186 --> 00:47:45.806 A:middle
Okay. So we have a solution
for that [laughter].

00:47:45.956 --> 00:47:47.366 A:middle
I took some liberties
with that one.

00:47:49.056 --> 00:47:51.246 A:middle
We have a solution for
that for you in iOS 9.

00:47:51.526 --> 00:47:54.236 A:middle
So now podcasts and audio
book apps can use a new

00:47:54.236 --> 00:47:57.546 A:middle
AVAudioSession mode called
AVAudioSession mode spoken

00:47:57.546 --> 00:48:01.026 A:middle
audio, and for navigation
and fitness apps or apps



00:47:57.546 --> 00:48:01.026 A:middle
audio, and for navigation
and fitness apps or apps

00:48:01.096 --> 00:48:02.336 A:middle
that issue vocal prompts

00:48:02.336 --> 00:48:04.286 A:middle
that interrupt other
applications' audio,

00:48:04.686 --> 00:48:08.396 A:middle
there's a new AVAudioSession
category option called Interrupt

00:48:08.396 --> 00:48:10.146 A:middle
Spoken Audio and
Mix with Others.

00:48:10.696 --> 00:48:13.386 A:middle
Now, Maps already uses
Interrupt Spoken Audio and Mix

00:48:13.386 --> 00:48:15.306 A:middle
with Others, and podcasts

00:48:15.356 --> 00:48:17.756 A:middle
and iBooks are already
using AVAudioSession mode

00:48:17.816 --> 00:48:18.586 A:middle
spoken audio.

00:48:19.176 --> 00:48:21.136 A:middle
How can you use these
in your application?

00:48:21.696 --> 00:48:23.046 A:middle
Well, let's look at some code.

00:48:23.426 --> 00:48:26.576 A:middle
I am just going to go through
these pieces of code line

00:48:26.576 --> 00:48:28.206 A:middle
by line so you can
see what we are doing.

00:48:28.436 --> 00:48:30.746 A:middle
First we will start with
your audio session setup.

00:48:30.976 --> 00:48:33.156 A:middle
You will get the shared
instance of the audio session,

00:48:33.606 --> 00:48:37.896 A:middle
set your category to
playback, and for your options,

00:48:37.896 --> 00:48:39.656 A:middle
you will use the
option duck others.

00:48:39.766 --> 00:48:42.416 A:middle
Now we are going to use
something new in Swift 2,

00:48:42.986 --> 00:48:44.576 A:middle
this new if # available.

00:48:44.796 --> 00:48:47.966 A:middle
If will allow you to deploy
the same code in iOS 9

00:48:48.106 --> 00:48:50.106 A:middle
that you can deploy
to earlier iOS's.

00:48:50.856 --> 00:48:54.406 A:middle
So only if you are on
iOS 9 or greater, you can

00:48:54.406 --> 00:48:56.246 A:middle
or in this extra option,

00:48:56.286 --> 00:48:58.356 A:middle
Interrupt Spoken Audio
and Mix with Others.

00:48:59.046 --> 00:49:00.936 A:middle
Then you will set your
audio session category.



00:48:59.046 --> 00:49:00.936 A:middle
Then you will set your
audio session category.

00:49:01.516 --> 00:49:04.346 A:middle
Okay. Let's actually
look at the nav prompt.

00:49:05.086 --> 00:49:07.266 A:middle
Now you are going to play
your navigation prompt

00:49:07.396 --> 00:49:08.246 A:middle
that looks like this.

00:49:08.856 --> 00:49:11.206 A:middle
First get the shared
instance of the audio session.

00:49:11.366 --> 00:49:14.646 A:middle
You will create an AV audio
player using the URL that's

00:49:14.696 --> 00:49:16.376 A:middle
supplied in the function
prototype.

00:49:17.326 --> 00:49:19.186 A:middle
You set the player's
delegate to self.

00:49:19.726 --> 00:49:22.906 A:middle
What this will do for you is it
will allow the delegate method

00:49:22.906 --> 00:49:24.576 A:middle
to be called on your behalf

00:49:24.576 --> 00:49:26.716 A:middle
when your audio prompt
is finished playing.

00:49:27.246 --> 00:49:30.056 A:middle
Set your audio session
to active,

00:49:30.196 --> 00:49:31.616 A:middle
and then play on, player.

00:49:32.306 --> 00:49:35.166 A:middle
Now, here we go.

00:49:35.166 --> 00:49:37.176 A:middle
Now we are -- your
audio is done playing,

00:49:37.216 --> 00:49:38.966 A:middle
so your delegate
method is being called.

00:49:38.966 --> 00:49:40.576 A:middle
Audio player did finish playing.

00:49:40.996 --> 00:49:41.976 A:middle
The code looks like this.

00:49:42.566 --> 00:49:44.416 A:middle
Get the shared instance
of the audio session.

00:49:45.186 --> 00:49:47.496 A:middle
Set your audio session
to be inactive.

00:49:47.916 --> 00:49:51.566 A:middle
And use the option, option
notify others on deactivation.

00:49:52.396 --> 00:49:55.316 A:middle
This means any other audio
that was playing before you

00:49:55.316 --> 00:49:57.386 A:middle
from another process
can get notified

00:49:57.386 --> 00:49:59.846 A:middle
that you are done
interrupting them.



00:50:00.046 --> 00:50:01.256 A:middle
Now let's look at
the other side.

00:50:01.256 --> 00:50:05.526 A:middle
Let's go to the podcast or
spoken audio application.

00:50:06.256 --> 00:50:08.576 A:middle
Here's the audio
session setup for that.

00:50:08.766 --> 00:50:10.516 A:middle
Get the shared instance
of the audio session,

00:50:11.026 --> 00:50:12.736 A:middle
set your category to playback.

00:50:12.986 --> 00:50:16.936 A:middle
You let the mode be default for
now, but if you were running

00:50:16.936 --> 00:50:19.966 A:middle
in iOS 9 or later, you
can use this new mode,

00:50:20.056 --> 00:50:22.156 A:middle
AVAudioSession mode
spoken audio,

00:50:22.766 --> 00:50:24.306 A:middle
then set your category
and your mode.

00:50:25.566 --> 00:50:27.596 A:middle
The next thing you're
going to want to do is

00:50:27.596 --> 00:50:28.756 A:middle
to add an interruption handler.

00:50:28.996 --> 00:50:32.836 A:middle
We are going add an interruption
handler called handle

00:50:32.836 --> 00:50:35.886 A:middle
interruption and we want
it to be called in response

00:50:36.046 --> 00:50:39.196 A:middle
to AVAudioSession
interruption notification.

00:50:40.716 --> 00:50:43.706 A:middle
This is also a good time to
register for other notifications

00:50:43.706 --> 00:50:46.546 A:middle
of interest; for example, if the
media server died and you want

00:50:46.546 --> 00:50:49.026 A:middle
to be notified about that so
you can reset your audio state.

00:50:49.536 --> 00:50:52.686 A:middle
Okay. So now let's look at
the interruption handler.

00:50:54.196 --> 00:50:56.196 A:middle
The first thing we'll do here
is we will get the user info

00:50:56.196 --> 00:50:58.576 A:middle
dictionary from the NS
notification object that's

00:50:58.576 --> 00:51:01.496 A:middle
supplied in the function
prototype and from



00:50:58.576 --> 00:51:01.496 A:middle
supplied in the function
prototype and from

00:51:01.496 --> 00:51:03.276 A:middle
that user info dictionary
we will look

00:51:03.276 --> 00:51:06.276 A:middle
at the key AVAudioSession
interruption type key.

00:51:06.846 --> 00:51:09.346 A:middle
Now we are going to
switch on that type.

00:51:09.876 --> 00:51:12.286 A:middle
The first part of this is
going to be what happens

00:51:12.736 --> 00:51:15.556 A:middle
when your audio session is
beginning to be interrupted,

00:51:15.946 --> 00:51:17.736 A:middle
and then the second part
will be on the next slide,

00:51:17.736 --> 00:51:18.556 A:middle
and that's for the end.

00:51:18.656 --> 00:51:21.276 A:middle
So if this is a begin
interruption,

00:51:21.566 --> 00:51:23.656 A:middle
the first thing you will
want to do is update your UI

00:51:23.656 --> 00:51:25.656 A:middle
to indicate your playback
has already been stopped.

00:51:26.316 --> 00:51:29.756 A:middle
Then if your internal state
dictated that you were playing,

00:51:29.886 --> 00:51:31.606 A:middle
then you will set
was playing to true.

00:51:31.606 --> 00:51:35.216 A:middle
That will let you know later
on when this interruption is

00:51:35.216 --> 00:51:39.336 A:middle
over that you are okay to resume
audio, if that's appropriate.

00:51:39.686 --> 00:51:42.706 A:middle
Then, of course, update
your internal state.

00:51:44.016 --> 00:51:46.006 A:middle
So now this is the
end interruption,

00:51:46.186 --> 00:51:48.396 A:middle
so in case this is
the end interruption,

00:51:48.706 --> 00:51:50.996 A:middle
you'll get the flag from
the user info dictionary

00:51:50.996 --> 00:51:53.456 A:middle
at AVAudioSession
interruption option key,

00:51:54.076 --> 00:51:57.146 A:middle
and if that flag is
option should resume

00:51:57.196 --> 00:51:59.536 A:middle
and you were playing before
when you were interrupted,



00:52:00.006 --> 00:52:02.146 A:middle
rewind the audio
just a little bit

00:52:02.146 --> 00:52:04.456 A:middle
because your audio was
ducked before it was stopped,

00:52:04.686 --> 00:52:06.236 A:middle
and then you can play
your player again,

00:52:06.806 --> 00:52:09.896 A:middle
update your internal state, and
then update the UI to reflect

00:52:09.896 --> 00:52:11.206 A:middle
that the playback has resumed.

00:52:11.786 --> 00:52:14.166 A:middle
And that's all the
code I have for you.

00:52:15.376 --> 00:52:16.446 A:middle
Quick recap.

00:52:16.446 --> 00:52:17.446 A:middle
Today we have told you

00:52:17.446 --> 00:52:20.286 A:middle
about some exciting new
enhancements in AVAudioEngine.

00:52:20.586 --> 00:52:23.016 A:middle
We have introduced
Inter-Device Audio Mode.

00:52:23.756 --> 00:52:26.126 A:middle
We've told you about some new
CoreAudioKit view controllers

00:52:26.126 --> 00:52:28.096 A:middle
that you can embed into
your OS X applications

00:52:28.476 --> 00:52:31.686 A:middle
for Inter-Device Audio Mode,
Bluetooth Low Energy, MIDI,

00:52:31.686 --> 00:52:32.896 A:middle
and Audio Video Bridge.

00:52:33.776 --> 00:52:36.846 A:middle
And we've also introduced
AVAudioSession mode spoken audio

00:52:37.296 --> 00:52:40.536 A:middle
and the new AVAudioSession
category option Interrupt Spoken

00:52:40.536 --> 00:52:41.886 A:middle
Audio and Mix with Others.

00:52:42.666 --> 00:52:43.746 A:middle
But that's not all.

00:52:44.046 --> 00:52:47.436 A:middle
We have another session
coming up tomorrow at 11 a.m.

00:52:47.696 --> 00:52:51.186 A:middle
on all the exciting changes
to Audio Unit Extensions,

00:52:51.186 --> 00:52:52.326 A:middle
so we hope to see you all there.

00:52:53.126 --> 00:52:55.886 A:middle
Also some related sessions
that happened earlier today,

00:52:55.886 --> 00:52:57.706 A:middle
if you want to go
back and look at them,

00:52:57.706 --> 00:53:00.976 A:middle
especially if you are coming
in from the game audio side.



00:52:57.706 --> 00:53:00.976 A:middle
especially if you are coming
in from the game audio side.

00:53:02.136 --> 00:53:04.576 A:middle
If we are not able to answer
all your questions at the labs,

00:53:04.766 --> 00:53:08.606 A:middle
these are some very useful
websites that you can go to,

00:53:08.686 --> 00:53:12.566 A:middle
and any general inquiries can
be directed to Craig Keithley,

00:53:12.566 --> 00:53:17.296 A:middle
