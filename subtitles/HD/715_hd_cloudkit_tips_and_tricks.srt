00:00:22.516 --> 00:00:29.546 A:middle
[Applause]

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:32.006 A:middle
&gt;&gt; NIHAR SHARMA: Good
afternoon and welcome

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:33.846 A:middle
to the CloudKit tips
and tricks session.

00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:36.816 A:middle
My name is Nihar Sharma
and I'm an engineer

00:00:36.816 --> 00:00:38.656 A:middle
on the CloudKit team.

00:00:39.076 --> 00:00:41.956 A:middle
I know some of you may be
completely new to our platform

00:00:42.226 --> 00:00:43.966 A:middle
and encountering the
CloudKit framework

00:00:44.046 --> 00:00:47.526 A:middle
for the first time while
others may already have an app

00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:48.086 A:middle
on the Store.

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:51.036 A:middle
This session we will have
something for everyone.

00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:52.266 A:middle
Let's jump right in.

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:55.306 A:middle
What is CloudKit?

00:00:56.406 --> 00:01:01.036 A:middle
Last year we introduced CloudKit
as a whole new way for you



00:00:56.406 --> 00:01:01.036 A:middle
Last year we introduced CloudKit
as a whole new way for you

00:01:01.036 --> 00:01:03.986 A:middle
to be able to talk to Apple's
iCloud database servers.

00:01:05.016 --> 00:01:08.636 A:middle
With that we gave you a set
of built-in technologies

00:01:09.286 --> 00:01:10.516 A:middle
like large file storage.

00:01:12.186 --> 00:01:15.286 A:middle
We gave you a privacy
conscious identifier to be able

00:01:15.286 --> 00:01:18.196 A:middle
to manage the users
who could now be anyone

00:01:18.196 --> 00:01:21.336 A:middle
with an iCloud account.

00:01:21.336 --> 00:01:25.926 A:middle
First and foremost, we made
this public facing developer API

00:01:26.246 --> 00:01:28.746 A:middle
because we wanted you to be
able to leverage the power

00:01:28.746 --> 00:01:31.706 A:middle
of this platform and build
great apps for your users.

00:01:32.176 --> 00:01:36.926 A:middle
Last but not the least,
Apple's heavily invested

00:01:36.926 --> 00:01:37.766 A:middle
in this technology.

00:01:38.146 --> 00:01:40.036 A:middle
Last year alone when
we first shipped,

00:01:40.656 --> 00:01:41.566 A:middle
we shipped with a couple

00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:43.906 A:middle
of major clients
including iCloud drive

00:01:44.086 --> 00:01:48.096 A:middle
and iCloud photo library,
and this year we added a host

00:01:48.096 --> 00:01:50.716 A:middle
of new clients like the
Notes app, the news app

00:01:51.316 --> 00:01:54.456 A:middle
and WWDC app a lot of you have
been using throughout the week

00:01:54.736 --> 00:01:58.176 A:middle
and have in your
hands right now.

00:01:58.176 --> 00:02:01.666 A:middle
If all of this sounds unfamiliar
to you, I invite you to go back



00:01:58.176 --> 00:02:01.666 A:middle
If all of this sounds unfamiliar
to you, I invite you to go back

00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:03.766 A:middle
and take a look at
the intro to CloudKit

00:02:03.916 --> 00:02:06.496 A:middle
and Advanced CloudKit sessions
from last year's conference.

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:09.346 A:middle
They are a great resource for
an introduction to the new API,

00:02:09.346 --> 00:02:11.846 A:middle
and I highly recommend
you check them out.

00:02:12.476 --> 00:02:13.956 A:middle
First things first.

00:02:13.956 --> 00:02:16.206 A:middle
A lot of you have been playing

00:02:16.246 --> 00:02:18.886 A:middle
with the amazing new
features of Swift 2.

00:02:19.286 --> 00:02:22.396 A:middle
I'm pleased to announce
with iOS 9, the experience

00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:25.456 A:middle
of using CloudKit from
Swift is much better.

00:02:26.486 --> 00:02:28.646 A:middle
Let me give you a
couple of examples

00:02:28.646 --> 00:02:29.586 A:middle
of what I'm talking about.

00:02:30.256 --> 00:02:34.346 A:middle
Up until now, you had to use
the old set object for key,

00:02:34.346 --> 00:02:37.396 A:middle
object for key syntax when
setting and getting values

00:02:37.396 --> 00:02:40.386 A:middle
in the CK record, which are the
workhorse of the CloudKit API,

00:02:40.386 --> 00:02:44.176 A:middle
but with iOS 9, you can
use the much more familiar

00:02:44.176 --> 00:02:46.566 A:middle
and modern dictionary
subscripting syntax

00:02:46.776 --> 00:02:48.116 A:middle
when working with CK records.

00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:52.736 A:middle
In addition to that, we
have made your CloudKit code

00:02:52.896 --> 00:02:56.396 A:middle
from Swift as well as
Objective-C a lot more type safe

00:02:56.596 --> 00:02:58.486 A:middle
by adopting the libidity
qualifiers

00:02:58.676 --> 00:02:59.756 A:middle
and Lightweight generics.



00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:05.196 A:middle
Previously you could have set
an array of objects of any type

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:09.066 A:middle
on the records and safe
product of CKRecords operation.

00:03:09.726 --> 00:03:14.056 A:middle
Now with the latest tools in
iOS 9, the compiler can warn you

00:03:14.056 --> 00:03:16.676 A:middle
when you do that so you
can catch the errors early

00:03:16.966 --> 00:03:18.476 A:middle
and write more robust code.

00:03:18.476 --> 00:03:23.296 A:middle
So with that, let me
give you a brief recap

00:03:23.616 --> 00:03:25.306 A:middle
on the storage architecture
of CloudKit.

00:03:25.936 --> 00:03:31.136 A:middle
The top level silo in CloudKit
is called a CloudKit container.

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:35.756 A:middle
It is subdivided
into two databases.

00:03:36.276 --> 00:03:39.766 A:middle
The public database, which
is a large soup of all

00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:43.136 A:middle
of your apps data shared
among all of your users,

00:03:43.686 --> 00:03:46.906 A:middle
and the private database
which is tied

00:03:46.906 --> 00:03:48.216 A:middle
to a user's iCloud account.

00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:50.496 A:middle
This daatabase will contain data

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:53.266 A:middle
for a particular iCloud
account shared across all

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:54.376 A:middle
of that user's devices.

00:03:55.756 --> 00:03:59.366 A:middle
Within each database we have
a further layer of isolation

00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:01.036 A:middle
for the records you
store in them,



00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:01.036 A:middle
for the records you
store in them,

00:04:01.506 --> 00:04:03.106 A:middle
and we call these record zones.

00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:08.016 A:middle
They are a way for CloudKit to
offer additional capabilities

00:04:08.016 --> 00:04:10.056 A:middle
for the records you store
in them where we can.

00:04:10.056 --> 00:04:13.746 A:middle
If the public database has a
single zone called the default

00:04:13.746 --> 00:04:15.086 A:middle
zone where all the records live,

00:04:15.736 --> 00:04:20.216 A:middle
and the private database
also has one default zone.

00:04:20.636 --> 00:04:23.216 A:middle
Along with that, we
give you the capability

00:04:23.216 --> 00:04:25.336 A:middle
to create multiple custom zones

00:04:25.716 --> 00:04:29.196 A:middle
where you have these additional
capabilities for your records.

00:04:30.576 --> 00:04:33.756 A:middle
So with that, let's talk

00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:37.426 A:middle
about what we will cover
in our session today.

00:04:37.606 --> 00:04:39.386 A:middle
You might remember the
schema from last year.

00:04:39.836 --> 00:04:42.876 A:middle
We talked about an
example schema for an app

00:04:43.326 --> 00:04:44.686 A:middle
that shows parties with clouds.

00:04:45.046 --> 00:04:48.036 A:middle
It had a simple schema where
we had a party record type

00:04:48.036 --> 00:04:50.936 A:middle
and clown record type and stored
them in the public database.

00:04:51.766 --> 00:04:54.776 A:middle
I thought this year let's
run with this example

00:04:55.716 --> 00:04:57.496 A:middle
and develop a couple of
features for this app,

00:04:58.286 --> 00:05:00.336 A:middle
example app we'll
call clown central



00:04:58.286 --> 00:05:00.336 A:middle
example app we'll
call clown central

00:05:00.336 --> 00:05:02.896 A:middle
because it's all about clowns.

00:05:03.026 --> 00:05:07.036 A:middle
We will use the example to walk
through a set of tips and tricks

00:05:07.196 --> 00:05:09.076 A:middle
that you can use when
working with CloudKit.

00:05:09.076 --> 00:05:14.256 A:middle
Our app will have a simplistic
UI where we show the list

00:05:14.256 --> 00:05:17.266 A:middle
of parties and a couple of
features that we will walk

00:05:17.266 --> 00:05:19.976 A:middle
through together
in this session.

00:05:20.136 --> 00:05:23.606 A:middle
Now, truth as example, there
are four major areas I want

00:05:23.606 --> 00:05:24.236 A:middle
to cover today.

00:05:25.676 --> 00:05:27.586 A:middle
Number one is error handling.

00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:30.476 A:middle
Last year we told
you a difference

00:05:30.476 --> 00:05:33.106 A:middle
between a CloudKit app
that handles errors and one

00:05:33.106 --> 00:05:34.966 A:middle
that does not is
not the difference

00:05:34.966 --> 00:05:36.756 A:middle
between a great app
and a good one.

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:38.916 A:middle
It's a difference
between a functional app

00:05:39.116 --> 00:05:40.456 A:middle
and a completely broken one.

00:05:41.046 --> 00:05:42.156 A:middle
We meant it.

00:05:42.396 --> 00:05:45.626 A:middle
I would like to walk
you through a set

00:05:45.626 --> 00:05:48.416 A:middle
of special error codes you may
encounter when using the API

00:05:48.416 --> 00:05:50.696 A:middle
and give you some
general guidelines

00:05:50.876 --> 00:05:52.976 A:middle
on how to handle them.

00:05:53.396 --> 00:05:56.426 A:middle
With that, we'll start
talking about a couple of tips

00:05:56.426 --> 00:05:59.356 A:middle
that you can keep in mind
when maintaining a local cache

00:05:59.646 --> 00:06:00.676 A:middle
when working with CloudKit.



00:05:59.646 --> 00:06:00.676 A:middle
when working with CloudKit.

00:06:01.626 --> 00:06:04.156 A:middle
That will lead us into
talking about how to get set

00:06:04.156 --> 00:06:06.946 A:middle
up with subscriptions to
keep our cache up to date,

00:06:07.636 --> 00:06:10.096 A:middle
and finally I would
like to talk about a set

00:06:10.096 --> 00:06:12.806 A:middle
of general purpose performance
tips that you should keep

00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:15.176 A:middle
in mind and adopt
in your apps today.

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:18.636 A:middle
So we've got a ton of
great stuff to cover.

00:06:18.636 --> 00:06:21.296 A:middle
Let's jump in and talk
about error handling.

00:06:26.276 --> 00:06:27.496 A:middle
The first thing that I would

00:06:27.496 --> 00:06:29.616 A:middle
like to do is talk
about accounts.

00:06:30.816 --> 00:06:33.076 A:middle
CloudKit does not require you

00:06:33.076 --> 00:06:35.136 A:middle
to have an iCloud
account to be used.

00:06:35.446 --> 00:06:38.946 A:middle
We allow anonymous read only
access to the public database.

00:06:40.036 --> 00:06:41.996 A:middle
Let's say for demonstration
purposes here

00:06:41.996 --> 00:06:44.806 A:middle
that the clown central app
will require an iCloud account.

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:47.776 A:middle
We talk about a couple
of features

00:06:47.776 --> 00:06:50.926 A:middle
that use the private
database which, by definition,

00:06:50.926 --> 00:06:52.766 A:middle
require an authenticated
account.

00:06:53.336 --> 00:06:56.116 A:middle
And by default, write access

00:06:56.116 --> 00:06:58.076 A:middle
to the database requires
an account as well.

00:06:58.656 --> 00:07:03.206 A:middle
As a reminder, the way you
check the account status



00:06:58.656 --> 00:07:03.206 A:middle
As a reminder, the way you
check the account status

00:07:03.466 --> 00:07:06.016 A:middle
for the current user is by
using the account status

00:07:06.016 --> 00:07:11.236 A:middle
with completion handler API,
available on CK container.

00:07:11.836 --> 00:07:15.086 A:middle
Any errors that you encounter
when working with CloudKit due

00:07:15.086 --> 00:07:16.486 A:middle
to authentication will fail

00:07:16.486 --> 00:07:20.106 A:middle
with a special error code called
CKError not authenticated.

00:07:20.916 --> 00:07:23.826 A:middle
The general guideline we
give to handle this error is

00:07:23.826 --> 00:07:26.946 A:middle
to recheck the account status.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:29.256 A:middle
Let's say we have a
missing iCloud account.

00:07:30.076 --> 00:07:31.526 A:middle
When you check the
account status,

00:07:31.726 --> 00:07:36.026 A:middle
you receive CKAccount
status no account.

00:07:36.356 --> 00:07:40.276 A:middle
Previously you had no way
of knowing when requests

00:07:40.276 --> 00:07:42.456 A:middle
that failed due to a
missing account would start

00:07:42.456 --> 00:07:43.176 A:middle
succeeding again.

00:07:44.236 --> 00:07:47.656 A:middle
For that very purpose with
iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan,

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:50.476 A:middle
we added CKAccount
change notification.

00:07:50.906 --> 00:07:53.616 A:middle
We will send you this
notification whenever there is a

00:07:53.616 --> 00:07:57.136 A:middle
change to the user's account,
for example on log ins, log outs

00:07:57.456 --> 00:07:59.826 A:middle
or if the iCloud drive
capability switch is turned

00:07:59.826 --> 00:08:02.006 A:middle
on or off.



00:07:59.826 --> 00:08:02.006 A:middle
on or off.

00:08:02.846 --> 00:08:06.146 A:middle
With that I would like to touch
on a couple of best practices

00:08:06.146 --> 00:08:09.106 A:middle
when handling a missing
account in your apps.

00:08:09.726 --> 00:08:13.206 A:middle
It might be tempting when
encountering this situation

00:08:13.206 --> 00:08:16.506 A:middle
to throw up an alert for the
user telling them they don't

00:08:16.506 --> 00:08:18.846 A:middle
have a logged in iCloud
account and can't proceed.

00:08:19.546 --> 00:08:21.616 A:middle
This is not helpful to the user

00:08:21.616 --> 00:08:25.456 A:middle
because they might dismiss the
alert and retry an operation

00:08:25.456 --> 00:08:28.506 A:middle
that led them to see the
alert in the first place.

00:08:29.116 --> 00:08:31.536 A:middle
What we recommend instead is

00:08:31.536 --> 00:08:35.116 A:middle
that you gracefully
degrade your UI in a way

00:08:35.116 --> 00:08:37.246 A:middle
that simply disables
the features of your app

00:08:37.736 --> 00:08:41.895 A:middle
that require an account, and
for this purpose you can now use

00:08:41.895 --> 00:08:44.396 A:middle
CKAccount change notification
to re-enable that UI,

00:08:44.396 --> 00:08:47.346 A:middle
when you receive it,
re-check the account status,

00:08:47.346 --> 00:08:49.236 A:middle
and see that one
account is now available.

00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:55.176 A:middle
A missing account is not
one of the only conditions

00:08:55.176 --> 00:08:59.026 A:middle
under which your operations
might fail temporarily,



00:09:00.756 --> 00:09:03.166 A:middle
but may start succeeding at
some point in the future.

00:09:04.506 --> 00:09:06.996 A:middle
For example, under
poor network conditions

00:09:07.116 --> 00:09:09.876 A:middle
where you might encounter this
error, CKError network failure,

00:09:11.346 --> 00:09:13.336 A:middle
or if the CloudKit
servers are busy.

00:09:13.516 --> 00:09:14.936 A:middle
Or you might see
one of these errors:

00:09:14.936 --> 00:09:18.226 A:middle
CKError service unavailable
or CKError zone busy.

00:09:19.206 --> 00:09:24.256 A:middle
When encountering this error, we
want you to retry the operation

00:09:24.256 --> 00:09:28.196 A:middle
at a later date, but
you might be wondering

00:09:28.426 --> 00:09:29.926 A:middle
when do I retry those
operations?

00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:32.896 A:middle
Well, you don't have
to guess at that value.

00:09:33.676 --> 00:09:37.776 A:middle
In these errors, user info
dictionaries we return

00:09:37.776 --> 00:09:41.946 A:middle
to you a special value under the
key "CKError retry after key."

00:09:42.976 --> 00:09:46.246 A:middle
This value is a value of
time in seconds that you need

00:09:46.246 --> 00:09:48.516 A:middle
to wait before retrying
that operation.

00:09:51.156 --> 00:09:53.476 A:middle
Now, let's take a
similar example

00:09:54.066 --> 00:09:57.206 A:middle
where let's say our
app initially had a bug

00:09:57.206 --> 00:10:00.356 A:middle
which might have caused it
to send a lot of updates



00:09:57.206 --> 00:10:00.356 A:middle
which might have caused it
to send a lot of updates

00:10:00.356 --> 00:10:03.246 A:middle
to the server in a very
short amount of time.

00:10:03.246 --> 00:10:07.006 A:middle
Let's say if this app made it to
the wild in that way and a lot

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:08.326 A:middle
of users started
hitting that bug,

00:10:08.636 --> 00:10:10.426 A:middle
it would overwhelm
the iCloud servers.

00:10:11.086 --> 00:10:12.876 A:middle
The way we avoid this is

00:10:12.876 --> 00:10:16.826 A:middle
by using a special error
code called CKError request

00:10:16.826 --> 00:10:17.306 A:middle
rate limited.

00:10:18.536 --> 00:10:22.076 A:middle
This is CloudKit's way of
mitigating application bugs

00:10:22.186 --> 00:10:24.166 A:middle
from overwhelming
the iCloud servers.

00:10:25.836 --> 00:10:30.296 A:middle
Any requests that hit the rate
limited error will not be sent

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:33.456 A:middle
up to the server until a
period of time has elapsed.

00:10:34.156 --> 00:10:35.936 A:middle
Once again what is
that period of time?

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:40.496 A:middle
It is given to you by the
CKError retry after key.

00:10:42.036 --> 00:10:45.626 A:middle
So when you encounter this
error, look for this key

00:10:45.626 --> 00:10:47.116 A:middle
in the errors user
info dictionary.

00:10:47.496 --> 00:10:50.046 A:middle
Wait for a period of time,
and retry your request.

00:10:50.656 --> 00:10:54.236 A:middle
Now I would like to start
talking about a different class

00:10:54.236 --> 00:10:55.996 A:middle
of errors that you
might encounter

00:10:56.866 --> 00:10:59.706 A:middle
because of the way your schema
is designed, specifically

00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:05.716 A:middle
if your schema allows multiple
users to update the same record



00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:05.716 A:middle
if your schema allows multiple
users to update the same record

00:11:05.716 --> 00:11:06.706 A:middle
in your Cloud database.

00:11:07.746 --> 00:11:10.356 A:middle
So let's say we want to
add a feature to our app

00:11:10.686 --> 00:11:13.986 A:middle
where we allow attendees to
add themselves to a party.

00:11:15.276 --> 00:11:17.786 A:middle
But unfortunately, when
designing the schema

00:11:17.786 --> 00:11:20.926 A:middle
for this feature, we did not
watch last year's advanced

00:11:20.926 --> 00:11:21.556 A:middle
CloudKit session.

00:11:22.956 --> 00:11:24.606 A:middle
So this is a schema
we came up with.

00:11:25.866 --> 00:11:29.336 A:middle
On the party record itself,
we decided to store an array

00:11:29.336 --> 00:11:31.446 A:middle
of references to
attendee records

00:11:31.496 --> 00:11:32.536 A:middle
that want to join that party.

00:11:33.206 --> 00:11:38.776 A:middle
Now, you can see that
every single time we wish

00:11:38.776 --> 00:11:41.256 A:middle
to add an attendee to a
particular party, we are going

00:11:41.256 --> 00:11:43.576 A:middle
to end up modifying
the same party record.

00:11:45.116 --> 00:11:47.646 A:middle
Let's take a look at an
example of what happens

00:11:47.966 --> 00:11:53.116 A:middle
when two different users try
to add themselves to a party.

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.936 A:middle
Since the WWDC bash
is starting up soon,

00:11:56.216 --> 00:12:00.626 A:middle
let's say we saved this
record to CloudKit.



00:11:56.216 --> 00:12:00.626 A:middle
let's say we saved this
record to CloudKit.

00:12:00.626 --> 00:12:03.456 A:middle
And now before we
get into what happens

00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:06.076 A:middle
when two users download this
record, I would like to talk

00:12:06.076 --> 00:12:10.466 A:middle
about what are record
change tags.

00:12:10.466 --> 00:12:15.796 A:middle
You can think of them as simply
a string that the server uses

00:12:15.796 --> 00:12:18.176 A:middle
to identify a particular
version of a record.

00:12:18.676 --> 00:12:21.706 A:middle
This version of the
record as it exists

00:12:21.706 --> 00:12:24.756 A:middle
on the server is recognized
by the change tag A.

00:12:26.026 --> 00:12:29.396 A:middle
We expose this to you as a read
only property on CKRecords,

00:12:29.586 --> 00:12:32.556 A:middle
but it will only be populated
on records that have been saved.

00:12:34.056 --> 00:12:36.716 A:middle
Let's say two users, John
and Alice, come along

00:12:36.716 --> 00:12:38.956 A:middle
and download this particular
version of the record.

00:12:39.546 --> 00:12:43.406 A:middle
You can see they receive
the same change tags, A.

00:12:43.656 --> 00:12:46.876 A:middle
Now, John adds himself as an
attendee to the party first,

00:12:47.586 --> 00:12:50.306 A:middle
goes ahead and tries to save
his record to the server.

00:12:51.436 --> 00:12:54.136 A:middle
Now, with the records saved,
we will send the change tag

00:12:54.136 --> 00:12:57.076 A:middle
that John had, which
is A, up to the server.

00:12:57.076 --> 00:12:59.736 A:middle
And the server sees that
the change tags match



00:13:00.616 --> 00:13:02.166 A:middle
and accepts John's modification.

00:13:03.376 --> 00:13:06.516 A:middle
Now, since the version of the
server record has changed,

00:13:06.776 --> 00:13:09.876 A:middle
the server will generate a new
change tag in this case, B,

00:13:10.036 --> 00:13:12.776 A:middle
and send that back to John
in the record save response.

00:13:12.776 --> 00:13:17.856 A:middle
Now let's say Alice comes along
and decides to attend the party.

00:13:19.436 --> 00:13:22.126 A:middle
She tries the same operation,
adds herself to the array

00:13:22.256 --> 00:13:23.906 A:middle
and tries to save her
version of the record.

00:13:24.626 --> 00:13:26.736 A:middle
This time you can see
that she will be sending

00:13:26.736 --> 00:13:30.476 A:middle
up the old change tag A,
and the server will complain

00:13:30.566 --> 00:13:33.516 A:middle
that she is trying to alter a
version of the server record

00:13:33.516 --> 00:13:34.666 A:middle
that no longer exists.

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:38.316 A:middle
She encountered a conflict.

00:13:38.316 --> 00:13:42.336 A:middle
On her device, the way CloudKit
tells her about this conflict is

00:13:42.336 --> 00:13:47.066 A:middle
by a special error code called
CK error: server record changed.

00:13:48.716 --> 00:13:51.596 A:middle
There's no magic
happening behind the scenes,

00:13:51.596 --> 00:13:53.276 A:middle
and we don't make assumptions

00:13:53.276 --> 00:13:55.366 A:middle
about how you wish
to resolve conflicts.

00:13:55.666 --> 00:13:57.066 A:middle
You are the best
person to do that.

00:13:57.566 --> 00:14:01.836 A:middle
So we will try to provide you
with as much useful information



00:13:57.566 --> 00:14:01.836 A:middle
So we will try to provide you
with as much useful information

00:14:01.836 --> 00:14:04.826 A:middle
as we can for you to resolve
those conflicts yourself.

00:14:05.866 --> 00:14:07.836 A:middle
And the first and most
important piece of information

00:14:07.836 --> 00:14:11.196 A:middle
that we give you is the
version of the record as it was

00:14:11.196 --> 00:14:13.356 A:middle
in the server when an
update was rejected.

00:14:14.676 --> 00:14:15.636 A:middle
Where do you find that?

00:14:15.906 --> 00:14:18.846 A:middle
You find that once again in the
errors user's info dictionary

00:14:19.116 --> 00:14:22.286 A:middle
under the key CKRecord changed
error, server record key.

00:14:22.286 --> 00:14:25.016 A:middle
In this case, when we pull it

00:14:25.016 --> 00:14:27.236 A:middle
out of the errors
user's info dictionary,

00:14:27.436 --> 00:14:29.726 A:middle
we would find the record
as it was in the server

00:14:29.956 --> 00:14:33.346 A:middle
with John attending the party
and the new change tag B.

00:14:33.946 --> 00:14:37.046 A:middle
Now, in addition to
the server record,

00:14:37.456 --> 00:14:40.146 A:middle
we give you back a few
more pieces of information.

00:14:42.036 --> 00:14:46.096 A:middle
These include the ancestor
record key which is the record

00:14:46.096 --> 00:14:49.426 A:middle
as Alice had before she made
any modifications to it.

00:14:50.836 --> 00:14:54.506 A:middle
And the client record key
which will contain the record

00:14:54.506 --> 00:14:59.566 A:middle
that Alice tried to
save to the server.

00:14:59.736 --> 00:15:01.946 A:middle
Now, what I want to
emphasize here is



00:14:59.736 --> 00:15:01.946 A:middle
Now, what I want to
emphasize here is

00:15:01.946 --> 00:15:05.496 A:middle
that the most important thing to
do, and what you will be doing

00:15:05.496 --> 00:15:07.436 A:middle
in most cases when
resolving a conflict,

00:15:07.896 --> 00:15:10.576 A:middle
is trying to save the
modifications that you were

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:12.996 A:middle
in the first place before
you encountered the error

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:15.946 A:middle
but instead on to the
server record returned

00:15:15.946 --> 00:15:16.666 A:middle
to you by the error.

00:15:17.486 --> 00:15:20.316 A:middle
So in this case, you
take the server record.

00:15:20.956 --> 00:15:23.686 A:middle
We'll make the same modification
to it that we were trying

00:15:23.686 --> 00:15:26.816 A:middle
to save, which in our case is
simply add Alice as an attendee

00:15:26.816 --> 00:15:31.346 A:middle
to the party, include her along
with John, and save this version

00:15:31.346 --> 00:15:32.306 A:middle
of the record to the server.

00:15:32.836 --> 00:15:37.416 A:middle
You can see that we have the
server's new change tag B.

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:40.716 A:middle
When we save the record
those change tags will match,

00:15:40.716 --> 00:15:42.026 A:middle
and the server will
accept the save.

00:15:42.576 --> 00:15:47.266 A:middle
Now, a point to note here is

00:15:47.266 --> 00:15:50.206 A:middle
that we could have avoided
this entire class of errors

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:52.426 A:middle
if we had used a better
schema for this feature.

00:15:53.616 --> 00:15:57.626 A:middle
I'll talk about what that
schema is in a short while.

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.216 A:middle
But you can see that trying



00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.216 A:middle
But you can see that trying

00:16:00.216 --> 00:16:03.536 A:middle
to modify the same record every
single time a different user

00:16:03.536 --> 00:16:05.646 A:middle
makes that modification
is not the best idea.

00:16:06.226 --> 00:16:11.106 A:middle
So talk through this new schema,

00:16:11.526 --> 00:16:13.636 A:middle
let's look at CloudKit
operations.

00:16:14.966 --> 00:16:19.056 A:middle
We want to add a feature to
our app that allows users

00:16:19.056 --> 00:16:20.686 A:middle
to store photos for parties.

00:16:22.016 --> 00:16:25.046 A:middle
We need a similar one-to-many
relationship between parties

00:16:25.046 --> 00:16:28.056 A:middle
and photos this time, so photos
would be their own record type,

00:16:28.846 --> 00:16:32.786 A:middle
but we don't want to store them
on the party record this time.

00:16:33.236 --> 00:16:34.286 A:middle
How do we do this?

00:16:34.286 --> 00:16:37.646 A:middle
We can save the photo
records with a back reference

00:16:37.646 --> 00:16:39.666 A:middle
to the party that they
belong to instead.

00:16:40.976 --> 00:16:46.376 A:middle
You can see now when we save
photo records, we don't have

00:16:46.376 --> 00:16:49.776 A:middle
to modify the party
record that they belong to.

00:16:52.896 --> 00:16:55.416 A:middle
So let's talk about how we
are saving these records.

00:16:56.026 --> 00:17:00.846 A:middle
Let's say right now in our app
we are using the convenience



00:16:56.026 --> 00:17:00.846 A:middle
Let's say right now in our app
we are using the convenience

00:17:00.846 --> 00:17:03.096 A:middle
API, save record with
completion handler

00:17:03.096 --> 00:17:06.506 A:middle
to save one photo
record at a time.

00:17:06.675 --> 00:17:11.406 A:middle
But users could potentially
store multiple photos at once.

00:17:11.465 --> 00:17:14.685 A:middle
In that case, we are currently
using the convenience API

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:17.306 A:middle
in the tight loop to
save multiple records.

00:17:18.195 --> 00:17:21.126 A:middle
Let's take a look at what is
happening behind the scenes

00:17:21.376 --> 00:17:22.165 A:middle
when we do that.

00:17:22.656 --> 00:17:28.096 A:middle
The app calls the convenience
API a bunch of times to be able

00:17:28.096 --> 00:17:29.526 A:middle
to save multiple photos.

00:17:30.436 --> 00:17:33.336 A:middle
Each one much those in
the system gets wrapped

00:17:33.486 --> 00:17:39.796 A:middle
into a CK operation with a set
of default values, and each one

00:17:39.796 --> 00:17:43.046 A:middle
of those operations turns into
at least one network request

00:17:43.176 --> 00:17:45.036 A:middle
when we try to save that
record up to the server.

00:17:45.836 --> 00:17:48.566 A:middle
We are not going to
overwhelm the server with all

00:17:48.566 --> 00:17:52.146 A:middle
of those requests at once, so we
have also created a bottleneck

00:17:52.146 --> 00:17:55.106 A:middle
in the system, and the system
sends up a few requests

00:17:55.106 --> 00:17:59.086 A:middle
at a time in order to
save those records.



00:18:00.106 --> 00:18:02.566 A:middle
Now, in addition
to this bottleneck,

00:18:02.566 --> 00:18:05.296 A:middle
there is one more thing
that you should consider.

00:18:05.956 --> 00:18:11.626 A:middle
Every single one of those
requests to save one record

00:18:11.626 --> 00:18:13.486 A:middle
at a time, for example
in this case,

00:18:13.846 --> 00:18:16.316 A:middle
counts against your
network request quota

00:18:16.316 --> 00:18:17.716 A:middle
as CloudKit app developers.

00:18:19.226 --> 00:18:20.606 A:middle
This is clearly a bad idea.

00:18:22.216 --> 00:18:24.906 A:middle
We want to be able to
batch those record updates

00:18:25.156 --> 00:18:28.346 A:middle
into one network request, or
at least the minimum number

00:18:28.346 --> 00:18:29.736 A:middle
of network requests possible.

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:30.956 A:middle
How do we do that?

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:36.286 A:middle
Well, we do that by using
the CK operation counterpart

00:18:36.286 --> 00:18:37.356 A:middle
to our convenience API.

00:18:38.876 --> 00:18:41.956 A:middle
Almost every convenience
API that works on one item

00:18:41.956 --> 00:18:45.056 A:middle
at a time has a CKOperation
counterpart

00:18:45.196 --> 00:18:46.786 A:middle
that batches record
updates together.

00:18:47.426 --> 00:18:50.816 A:middle
In this case we want to use
CKModify Records operation

00:18:51.186 --> 00:18:53.646 A:middle
to be able to save
multiple records at once

00:18:54.726 --> 00:18:57.226 A:middle
by providing them as an array
to the record save property.

00:18:57.876 --> 00:19:00.996 A:middle
Look at what happens when
we adopt this operation.



00:18:57.876 --> 00:19:00.996 A:middle
Look at what happens when
we adopt this operation.

00:19:01.496 --> 00:19:04.176 A:middle
Now we can bunch all of
the records that we want

00:19:04.206 --> 00:19:05.846 A:middle
to save into one operation.

00:19:06.456 --> 00:19:09.626 A:middle
It queues in the system.

00:19:09.626 --> 00:19:12.016 A:middle
The system is able to
use the minimum number

00:19:12.016 --> 00:19:14.876 A:middle
of requests it needs to be
able to save those records

00:19:14.876 --> 00:19:17.846 A:middle
to the server, and we
eliminated the bottleneck.

00:19:19.396 --> 00:19:24.216 A:middle
At the same time we've
helped you optimize the use

00:19:24.216 --> 00:19:25.156 A:middle
of your request quota.

00:19:26.496 --> 00:19:30.436 A:middle
This is an important point I
would like all of you to think

00:19:30.436 --> 00:19:32.856 A:middle
about in your apps when
using the convenience API.

00:19:33.646 --> 00:19:36.526 A:middle
If you are ever using it
for the same kind of request

00:19:36.526 --> 00:19:41.086 A:middle
in multiple places or some
kind of loop, think instead

00:19:41.086 --> 00:19:43.136 A:middle
of adopting the CKOperation API

00:19:43.136 --> 00:19:44.906 A:middle
that lets you batch
those updates.

00:19:44.906 --> 00:19:47.066 A:middle
It will save you
your request quota,

00:19:47.066 --> 00:19:50.566 A:middle
and at the same time be more
efficient for the system.

00:19:50.566 --> 00:19:51.266 A:middle
All right.

00:19:52.456 --> 00:19:55.036 A:middle
Now that we are working
with batches,

00:19:55.846 --> 00:19:58.766 A:middle
there is an additional
consideration

00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:00.366 A:middle
that we need to think about.



00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:00.366 A:middle
that we need to think about.

00:20:02.536 --> 00:20:05.836 A:middle
The server imposes
certain limits on the sizes

00:20:05.836 --> 00:20:07.906 A:middle
of the batches that
can be sent up at once.

00:20:09.776 --> 00:20:14.166 A:middle
These limits include the number
of items in each request,

00:20:15.346 --> 00:20:18.316 A:middle
as well as the total
size of the request.

00:20:18.526 --> 00:20:21.096 A:middle
The total size of the
request is simply the sum

00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:23.746 A:middle
of the key value data that
you set in the records

00:20:23.746 --> 00:20:25.026 A:middle
that that belong
to that request.

00:20:26.366 --> 00:20:30.086 A:middle
An impportant thing to keep
in mind here is that the size

00:20:30.086 --> 00:20:32.526 A:middle
of the data the you are
trying to store as part

00:20:32.526 --> 00:20:36.886 A:middle
of bulk stoarage via the CKAsset
API does not count towards this

00:20:36.886 --> 00:20:37.636 A:middle
key value data.

00:20:38.206 --> 00:20:43.496 A:middle
But if your request were to
trip any one of these limits,

00:20:44.616 --> 00:20:47.446 A:middle
you would receive a special
error code called CKError

00:20:47.446 --> 00:20:48.176 A:middle
limit exceeded.

00:20:49.016 --> 00:20:51.766 A:middle
The general guideline
we give developers

00:20:51.766 --> 00:20:54.696 A:middle
to handle this error is simply
divide the number of items

00:20:54.696 --> 00:20:58.836 A:middle
in your batch by half and issue
two operations instead of one.



00:21:00.086 --> 00:21:03.206 A:middle
And recursively do that if those
operations encounter the same

00:21:03.206 --> 00:21:05.926 A:middle
error again.

00:21:06.366 --> 00:21:10.636 A:middle
Now, what if only some items
in your batch were to fail?

00:21:10.856 --> 00:21:15.076 A:middle
Since the batch consists
of a lot of items

00:21:15.076 --> 00:21:18.526 A:middle
but returns only one error to
you, we still want to tell you

00:21:18.526 --> 00:21:20.256 A:middle
about every single
one of those errors.

00:21:20.996 --> 00:21:25.376 A:middle
We do that by using a special
error code called CKError

00:21:25.376 --> 00:21:26.176 A:middle
partial failure.

00:21:27.476 --> 00:21:31.296 A:middle
This is a top level error code
that you don't really want

00:21:31.296 --> 00:21:34.636 A:middle
to handle directly,
but once again

00:21:35.246 --> 00:21:37.096 A:middle
under the errors
user's info dictionary,

00:21:37.096 --> 00:21:40.016 A:middle
if you look under CKPartial
errors by item ID key,

00:21:40.106 --> 00:21:42.946 A:middle
we will give you a
dictionary of item IDs

00:21:42.946 --> 00:21:47.106 A:middle
to the corresponding
errors from your batch.

00:21:47.286 --> 00:21:51.146 A:middle
For example, in this case we
have had one item ID that failed

00:21:51.146 --> 00:21:53.826 A:middle
with CKRecord invalid
arguments, and there may

00:21:53.826 --> 00:21:56.426 A:middle
or may not be errors for any
other items in your batch.

00:21:56.756 --> 00:22:00.516 A:middle
You want to open this up, look
inside the dictionary and handle



00:21:56.756 --> 00:22:00.516 A:middle
You want to open this up, look
inside the dictionary and handle

00:22:00.516 --> 00:22:01.486 A:middle
that error individually.

00:22:03.456 --> 00:22:05.686 A:middle
This situation changes slightly

00:22:06.346 --> 00:22:09.536 A:middle
when considering atomic
updates in custom zones.

00:22:11.356 --> 00:22:15.626 A:middle
Custom zones, as a
reminder, have the capability

00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:17.776 A:middle
for your CKModify
records operation

00:22:17.776 --> 00:22:19.046 A:middle
to issue atomic updates,

00:22:19.096 --> 00:22:22.346 A:middle
in which case the server will
either accept the entire batch

00:22:22.346 --> 00:22:24.436 A:middle
as one or fail the entire batch.

00:22:25.806 --> 00:22:28.526 A:middle
Now, if one item in our
batch, as in this case,

00:22:28.526 --> 00:22:31.046 A:middle
would have failed with
CKError invalid arguments,

00:22:31.106 --> 00:22:33.656 A:middle
the rest of the item IDs
would also contain an errror

00:22:34.036 --> 00:22:36.886 A:middle
with a special error code,
CKRecords batch request failed.

00:22:38.096 --> 00:22:40.066 A:middle
When working with
atomic updates,

00:22:40.066 --> 00:22:42.136 A:middle
make sure to look
inside the dictionaries

00:22:42.326 --> 00:22:43.966 A:middle
and handle all the
errors that are not

00:22:44.066 --> 00:22:47.916 A:middle
in CKError batch request fails.

00:22:48.476 --> 00:22:51.766 A:middle
That's storing all of our
photo records up to the Cloud

00:22:51.766 --> 00:22:53.916 A:middle
in an optimized manner.

00:22:53.916 --> 00:22:57.616 A:middle
Let's talk about the other
half, downloading them.

00:22:57.616 --> 00:23:00.116 A:middle
The way we do that is by
using CloudKit queries.



00:22:57.616 --> 00:23:00.116 A:middle
The way we do that is by
using CloudKit queries.

00:23:00.206 --> 00:23:00.356 A:middle
All right.

00:23:01.466 --> 00:23:02.696 A:middle
Downloading photo records

00:23:02.696 --> 00:23:06.136 A:middle
for a particular party
has now become really easy

00:23:06.136 --> 00:23:08.966 A:middle
with the new schema
that we adopted

00:23:08.966 --> 00:23:11.766 A:middle
where photo records reference
the party they belong to.

00:23:12.646 --> 00:23:15.556 A:middle
We do that by simply
constructing a CK query

00:23:15.866 --> 00:23:17.486 A:middle
that tries to match
that reference

00:23:17.706 --> 00:23:21.786 A:middle
to a known party record ID.

00:23:22.046 --> 00:23:25.076 A:middle
Now, when we issue our query
to download photos for a party,

00:23:25.856 --> 00:23:27.746 A:middle
some parties might
have a lot of photos.

00:23:28.046 --> 00:23:31.106 A:middle
Do we really need to
download all of them?

00:23:31.106 --> 00:23:35.396 A:middle
Let's take a look at how we
can issue an optimized download

00:23:35.396 --> 00:23:37.026 A:middle
for the photos for
a particular party

00:23:37.346 --> 00:23:38.946 A:middle
by using CKQuery operation.

00:23:41.996 --> 00:23:44.406 A:middle
The first question
to really answer is:

00:23:44.706 --> 00:23:47.656 A:middle
We have no idea how many photos
belong to a particular party.

00:23:47.936 --> 00:23:49.306 A:middle
So how many should we download?

00:23:49.376 --> 00:23:52.146 A:middle
It doesn't make sense
to download all of them.

00:23:53.276 --> 00:23:55.526 A:middle
What makes sense is for our UI

00:23:55.526 --> 00:23:57.306 A:middle
to drive the answer
to that question.

00:23:58.246 --> 00:24:00.266 A:middle
Now, if you take a look
at our example UI here,



00:23:58.246 --> 00:24:00.266 A:middle
Now, if you take a look
at our example UI here,

00:24:00.556 --> 00:24:03.436 A:middle
you can see that when we
pull up a particular party,

00:24:03.676 --> 00:24:06.366 A:middle
all we see are 20 photos.

00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:09.466 A:middle
So it would make a lot of sense

00:24:09.526 --> 00:24:13.046 A:middle
if our query only
returned 20 photos to us

00:24:13.116 --> 00:24:14.206 A:middle
when we first issued it.

00:24:15.176 --> 00:24:18.366 A:middle
We can do just that by using
the results limit property

00:24:18.536 --> 00:24:19.736 A:middle
on CKQuery operation.

00:24:20.916 --> 00:24:26.816 A:middle
This property helps a lot for
you to be able to manage items

00:24:27.026 --> 00:24:28.386 A:middle
in a particular batch size

00:24:28.446 --> 00:24:31.086 A:middle
when you have no idea how
many items might be returned

00:24:31.086 --> 00:24:31.856 A:middle
to you in total.

00:24:32.466 --> 00:24:35.516 A:middle
So for that reason
it is also available

00:24:35.516 --> 00:24:37.736 A:middle
on CKFetch record
changes operation

00:24:38.036 --> 00:24:40.056 A:middle
where you maybe returned
a lot of changes,

00:24:40.056 --> 00:24:42.526 A:middle
and you have no idea how
many from a custom zone

00:24:43.866 --> 00:24:46.576 A:middle
and on CKFetch notification
changes operation

00:24:46.576 --> 00:24:47.646 A:middle
for a similar reason.

00:24:47.646 --> 00:24:48.306 A:middle
All right.

00:24:49.156 --> 00:24:52.656 A:middle
So now we are downloading
just 20 records.

00:24:52.986 --> 00:24:53.796 A:middle
That's an improvement.

00:24:54.496 --> 00:24:55.986 A:middle
But can we do better?

00:24:56.756 --> 00:24:58.456 A:middle
Well, let's take a look at
what we are downloading.

00:24:59.266 --> 00:25:02.066 A:middle
Once again we let our UI
answer this question for us.



00:24:59.266 --> 00:25:02.066 A:middle
Once again we let our UI
answer this question for us.

00:25:02.236 --> 00:25:04.686 A:middle
Whenever we are viewing
a particular party,

00:25:04.686 --> 00:25:07.856 A:middle
all we are seeing is
tiny thumbnails, cropped

00:25:07.856 --> 00:25:09.806 A:middle
and down scaled photos
for a particular party.

00:25:11.136 --> 00:25:14.876 A:middle
But what we've stored
on our photo record

00:25:15.116 --> 00:25:18.046 A:middle
that is being downloaded
completely by default

00:25:18.046 --> 00:25:22.266 A:middle
for us is probably a high
resolution version of that photo

00:25:23.446 --> 00:25:25.526 A:middle
that we've taken with
the amazing cameras

00:25:25.526 --> 00:25:26.596 A:middle
on our iOS devices.

00:25:27.786 --> 00:25:30.976 A:middle
Well, wouldn't it be great
if we could somehow add

00:25:30.976 --> 00:25:33.666 A:middle
that information right
on to our photo record

00:25:34.406 --> 00:25:37.746 A:middle
so that we have something that
we can pull down partially,

00:25:38.606 --> 00:25:40.376 A:middle
but how do we pull
down partial records?

00:25:41.006 --> 00:25:43.656 A:middle
Well, we do that by using
the desired keys property

00:25:43.946 --> 00:25:45.166 A:middle
on CKQuery operation.

00:25:46.326 --> 00:25:50.216 A:middle
In this case, the desired keys
property will take an array

00:25:50.216 --> 00:25:53.026 A:middle
of keys that you wish to
fetch on all the records

00:25:53.026 --> 00:25:53.826 A:middle
that match your query.

00:25:55.136 --> 00:25:57.366 A:middle
So if we set that just to
be our photo thumbnail,

00:25:57.366 --> 00:26:00.406 A:middle
you can see that we have
drastically reduced the amount



00:25:57.366 --> 00:26:00.406 A:middle
you can see that we have
drastically reduced the amount

00:26:00.406 --> 00:26:02.906 A:middle
of data that we are loading
when our query returns.

00:26:05.696 --> 00:26:09.156 A:middle
This is also available on
CKFetch records operation

00:26:09.536 --> 00:26:12.346 A:middle
where you may know the
record IDs in advance

00:26:12.346 --> 00:26:15.106 A:middle
of the records you are
fetching, but either your UI

00:26:15.106 --> 00:26:18.466 A:middle
or some other reason you
only want partial records

00:26:18.576 --> 00:26:19.236 A:middle
to be downloaded.

00:26:21.406 --> 00:26:24.266 A:middle
As well as on CKFetch
record changes operation

00:26:24.396 --> 00:26:27.386 A:middle
which once again by default
downloads the full record

00:26:27.796 --> 00:26:29.366 A:middle
for any records that
may have changed.

00:26:29.886 --> 00:26:35.106 A:middle
So now that we're displaying
only 20 photos, it makes sense

00:26:35.106 --> 00:26:38.236 A:middle
for us to have a certain
ordering on the photos

00:26:38.236 --> 00:26:39.786 A:middle
that we are first
displaying to the user.

00:26:40.416 --> 00:26:43.266 A:middle
Let's say we want to show
the photos in the order

00:26:43.266 --> 00:26:45.516 A:middle
that they have been,
in the order

00:26:45.516 --> 00:26:48.076 A:middle
that they were most
recently saved into iCloud.

00:26:50.226 --> 00:26:54.686 A:middle
We do that by setting the sort
discriptor right on the CKQuery

00:26:54.686 --> 00:26:56.976 A:middle
that we initialized our
CKQuery operation with.

00:26:57.586 --> 00:27:01.876 A:middle
You can see here we are
creating a sort descriptor



00:26:57.586 --> 00:27:01.876 A:middle
You can see here we are
creating a sort descriptor

00:27:01.876 --> 00:27:04.946 A:middle
on the creation date key
which is a system field

00:27:05.086 --> 00:27:07.976 A:middle
on all CKRecords that have
been saved to the server.

00:27:08.536 --> 00:27:11.096 A:middle
And set that to descending.

00:27:11.696 --> 00:27:17.646 A:middle
One thing to keep in mind here,
since this is a system field,

00:27:17.906 --> 00:27:21.096 A:middle
you need to ensure that
it's sortable on the server.

00:27:21.656 --> 00:27:24.736 A:middle
You do that configuration
via the iCloud dashboard.

00:27:25.606 --> 00:27:26.656 A:middle
Make sure to have

00:27:26.656 --> 00:27:29.426 A:middle
that configuration set before
those records are saved.

00:27:29.926 --> 00:27:34.976 A:middle
Otherwise, the previous records
saved previously are not going

00:27:34.976 --> 00:27:37.626 A:middle
to have that index on them.

00:27:38.296 --> 00:27:41.136 A:middle
So now that we are
fetching just a small slice

00:27:41.206 --> 00:27:43.956 A:middle
of our entire results
set, you may be wondering,

00:27:43.956 --> 00:27:45.546 A:middle
how do we show the
user the rest?

00:27:45.826 --> 00:27:48.506 A:middle
Say the user starts scrolling
down, and we want to look

00:27:48.506 --> 00:27:49.776 A:middle
at the next batch of photos.

00:27:51.876 --> 00:27:55.086 A:middle
How do we implement
pagination in this case?

00:27:55.676 --> 00:27:58.666 A:middle
Well, we do that by
looking at what we get back

00:27:58.736 --> 00:27:59.986 A:middle
in our query completion block.



00:28:01.306 --> 00:28:04.976 A:middle
When a query completes, in
addition to all the results

00:28:04.976 --> 00:28:06.966 A:middle
that were returned to us
in the progress call backs,

00:28:07.256 --> 00:28:09.066 A:middle
we get back a CKQuery cursor.

00:28:10.576 --> 00:28:16.906 A:middle
This is an opaque marker for you
to use that shows you your place

00:28:16.906 --> 00:28:18.186 A:middle
in the entire results set.

00:28:18.936 --> 00:28:21.856 A:middle
So you should store the
query cursor returned to you

00:28:21.856 --> 00:28:25.806 A:middle
from the first query
operation, and when you wish

00:28:25.806 --> 00:28:28.496 A:middle
to fetch the next
batch of results,

00:28:28.936 --> 00:28:32.556 A:middle
initialize another CKQuery
operation using the cursor

00:28:32.556 --> 00:28:34.636 A:middle
initializer and pass it,

00:28:34.956 --> 00:28:37.296 A:middle
the cursor that you
stored previously.

00:28:37.296 --> 00:28:43.386 A:middle
Now, since we are optimizing
our CKQuery operation

00:28:43.386 --> 00:28:47.216 A:middle
in this manner, make sure
to set the same desired keys

00:28:47.216 --> 00:28:49.976 A:middle
and results limit on the new
query operation once again.

00:28:50.976 --> 00:28:54.276 A:middle
That will give you just the
optimized next batch of photos.

00:28:56.956 --> 00:28:59.696 A:middle
That was about downloading
records.



00:29:01.086 --> 00:29:05.716 A:middle
Now I would like to switch
gears and talk about some tips

00:29:05.716 --> 00:29:06.926 A:middle
that you can keep in mind

00:29:07.066 --> 00:29:11.376 A:middle
when maintaining a local
cache working with CloudKit.

00:29:11.376 --> 00:29:12.736 A:middle
Let's start talking
about a new feature.

00:29:13.286 --> 00:29:17.336 A:middle
Let's say we want to add
the ability for users

00:29:17.336 --> 00:29:20.416 A:middle
to store small personal
Notes for parties.

00:29:20.656 --> 00:29:24.326 A:middle
Now, since these Notes
are going to be personal,

00:29:24.946 --> 00:29:27.176 A:middle
we want to store them in
the user's private database.

00:29:27.696 --> 00:29:33.596 A:middle
We don't want to fetch these
Notes every single time a user

00:29:33.596 --> 00:29:35.716 A:middle
wants to view them
or modify them.

00:29:36.446 --> 00:29:38.016 A:middle
We want to make sure
that we have some kind

00:29:38.016 --> 00:29:39.786 A:middle
of offline access
for these Notes.

00:29:40.256 --> 00:29:45.936 A:middle
And you can see that in this
particular scenario what we

00:29:46.206 --> 00:29:50.126 A:middle
actually need is a small
amount of data but on all

00:29:50.126 --> 00:29:51.606 A:middle
of a particular user's devices.

00:29:52.936 --> 00:29:55.956 A:middle
So it makes a lot of sense for
us to maintain a local cache

00:29:56.636 --> 00:30:00.436 A:middle
when working with
CloudKit in this scenario.



00:29:56.636 --> 00:30:00.436 A:middle
when working with
CloudKit in this scenario.

00:30:00.436 --> 00:30:03.346 A:middle
Let's first talk about how we
can start downloading things

00:30:03.346 --> 00:30:04.406 A:middle
from a private database.

00:30:05.566 --> 00:30:09.396 A:middle
Now, if you recall, we have the
ability to store custom zones

00:30:09.396 --> 00:30:11.866 A:middle
in the private database that
gave us additional capabilities.

00:30:13.096 --> 00:30:14.856 A:middle
We go ahead and do just that.

00:30:15.366 --> 00:30:18.686 A:middle
Create a new zone in the private
database called the notes zone.

00:30:19.926 --> 00:30:21.796 A:middle
And now we have two main ways

00:30:22.086 --> 00:30:25.936 A:middle
in which we can start
fetching data from this zone.

00:30:26.136 --> 00:30:28.866 A:middle
Once again, we can either
use a CKQuery operation

00:30:29.156 --> 00:30:31.126 A:middle
and optimize it just
the way we saw,

00:30:31.616 --> 00:30:36.576 A:middle
or we can use delta downloads
via the CKRecords fetch

00:30:36.666 --> 00:30:41.236 A:middle
operation which lets us
fetch only the records

00:30:41.236 --> 00:30:42.556 A:middle
in the zone that have changed.

00:30:43.086 --> 00:30:48.276 A:middle
If you recall, this operation is
only available to work on zones

00:30:48.276 --> 00:30:50.036 A:middle
which have the fetch
changes capability.

00:30:50.536 --> 00:30:52.226 A:middle
Currently, all custom zones

00:30:52.226 --> 00:30:54.406 A:middle
in a private database
do have this capability.

00:30:55.936 --> 00:30:57.246 A:middle
Now, if you wish to learn more

00:30:57.246 --> 00:31:00.056 A:middle
about how exactly delta
downloads work, I invite you



00:30:57.246 --> 00:31:00.056 A:middle
about how exactly delta
downloads work, I invite you

00:31:00.056 --> 00:31:01.186 A:middle
to go back and look

00:31:01.186 --> 00:31:02.886 A:middle
at the advanced CloudKit
session from last year.

00:31:03.216 --> 00:31:06.596 A:middle
It's a great walk through of
how the operation exactly works.

00:31:07.126 --> 00:31:10.726 A:middle
Let's say we are using it.

00:31:11.236 --> 00:31:12.766 A:middle
We've started fetching
our changes.

00:31:13.136 --> 00:31:16.756 A:middle
We have our app objects that
we are storing in some sort

00:31:16.756 --> 00:31:18.386 A:middle
of local database,
whether it's core data

00:31:18.676 --> 00:31:20.246 A:middle
or any other database
of your choice.

00:31:21.166 --> 00:31:24.276 A:middle
That's where we encode
our app objects currently.

00:31:25.936 --> 00:31:28.206 A:middle
So here we have a party object.

00:31:28.406 --> 00:31:31.776 A:middle
We see we've added the notes
key on it corresponding

00:31:32.096 --> 00:31:34.106 A:middle
for that particular user's
Notes for that party.

00:31:34.896 --> 00:31:39.266 A:middle
We encode our app object
to our local storage.

00:31:39.266 --> 00:31:42.156 A:middle
When working with a
corresponding CKRecords,

00:31:42.686 --> 00:31:46.766 A:middle
we want to store those
records up in the Cloud.

00:31:46.916 --> 00:31:50.616 A:middle
We might think about
encoding the entire CKRecord

00:31:51.446 --> 00:31:55.766 A:middle
so that we have that cached
along with our app object.

00:31:56.196 --> 00:31:57.646 A:middle
Let's take a look at
what happens here.

00:31:58.036 --> 00:32:00.796 A:middle
You can see that
CKRecord also has all



00:31:58.036 --> 00:32:00.796 A:middle
You can see that
CKRecord also has all

00:32:00.796 --> 00:32:02.366 A:middle
of the app objects
key set on it.

00:32:02.676 --> 00:32:05.796 A:middle
Of course, when we encode
it we are duplicating all

00:32:05.796 --> 00:32:06.536 A:middle
of the apps keys.

00:32:07.936 --> 00:32:09.976 A:middle
Once we encoded our
app object and now

00:32:09.976 --> 00:32:11.446 A:middle
when we are encoding
our CKRecord.

00:32:12.266 --> 00:32:15.286 A:middle
This is clearly not
what we want.

00:32:16.006 --> 00:32:18.196 A:middle
Well, the orange
fields that you saw

00:32:18.196 --> 00:32:21.776 A:middle
on the CKRecord belong
just to the CKRecord.

00:32:22.316 --> 00:32:24.546 A:middle
They are the fields
needed by the server

00:32:24.546 --> 00:32:26.796 A:middle
to recognize a particular
version of the record.

00:32:27.016 --> 00:32:28.536 A:middle
We call them system fields.

00:32:29.456 --> 00:32:32.176 A:middle
So what you really want
in this case is a way

00:32:32.176 --> 00:32:35.176 A:middle
to encode just the system
fields of the record.

00:32:36.096 --> 00:32:39.456 A:middle
And you can do just that by
using the encode system fields

00:32:39.456 --> 00:32:41.336 A:middle
with coder API on CKRecord.

00:32:42.896 --> 00:32:45.536 A:middle
Now this is all the code
that you need to be able

00:32:45.536 --> 00:32:46.846 A:middle
to encode those system fields.

00:32:46.846 --> 00:32:50.416 A:middle
I highly recommend that you
reference this if you ever,

00:32:50.416 --> 00:32:54.766 A:middle
if the situation arises and
you ever need to look back.

00:32:55.016 --> 00:32:56.346 A:middle
Now let's take a
look at what happens

00:32:56.346 --> 00:32:58.396 A:middle
when we start encoding
just the system fields.

00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:02.636 A:middle
We are efficiently storing
now what is important



00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:02.636 A:middle
We are efficiently storing
now what is important

00:33:02.636 --> 00:33:07.976 A:middle
about a CKRecord and the
corresponding party object.

00:33:08.126 --> 00:33:11.096 A:middle
Now, let's walk through a
scenario of what happens

00:33:11.306 --> 00:33:13.166 A:middle
when we try to modify
a party object

00:33:13.546 --> 00:33:18.256 A:middle
for which we've stored the
system fields in this manner.

00:33:18.416 --> 00:33:22.666 A:middle
For that we use the coder
initializer for CKRecord.

00:33:26.796 --> 00:33:28.566 A:middle
So you can see that
when we pull it out,

00:33:29.456 --> 00:33:34.706 A:middle
we will get back all the system
fields that we had stored.

00:33:34.706 --> 00:33:37.316 A:middle
For brevity I've only shown the
record ID and the change tag

00:33:37.656 --> 00:33:40.226 A:middle
which we've already seen.

00:33:40.426 --> 00:33:44.406 A:middle
Now on this bare CKRecord it is
completely legitimate for you

00:33:44.406 --> 00:33:48.766 A:middle
to set just the keys that
have changed on this record.

00:33:49.156 --> 00:33:50.816 A:middle
So let's say we want to
change just the party

00:33:51.696 --> 00:33:54.926 A:middle
and make this record
our WWDC bash record.

00:33:55.176 --> 00:33:57.186 A:middle
We set the new value
for that key

00:33:57.536 --> 00:33:58.996 A:middle
and save the new
record for the server.

00:33:59.556 --> 00:34:05.686 A:middle
It is important to note that
you don't always have to set all



00:33:59.556 --> 00:34:05.686 A:middle
It is important to note that
you don't always have to set all

00:34:05.686 --> 00:34:07.836 A:middle
of the keys that
belong to a record

00:34:08.036 --> 00:34:10.186 A:middle
when storing changes
for that record.

00:34:10.186 --> 00:34:15.206 A:middle
So now that we are officially
maintaining and storing

00:34:15.206 --> 00:34:19.516 A:middle
that local cache, let's talk
about how do we fetch changes

00:34:19.596 --> 00:34:23.906 A:middle
from our custom zone in order
to keep that cache up to date?

00:34:24.186 --> 00:34:27.545 A:middle
Well, once again we already
have the answer to this

00:34:27.606 --> 00:34:31.286 A:middle
by using CKFetch record changes
operation which gives us all

00:34:31.286 --> 00:34:32.946 A:middle
of the records that have
changed in our zone.

00:34:33.596 --> 00:34:36.946 A:middle
The real question is, when
do we use this operation?

00:34:37.565 --> 00:34:40.505 A:middle
Because using this operation
alone does not tell us

00:34:40.656 --> 00:34:42.485 A:middle
when our zone has changed.

00:34:43.025 --> 00:34:44.446 A:middle
So for that we need

00:34:44.446 --> 00:34:49.426 A:middle
to use notifications via
the CKSubscription API.

00:34:49.676 --> 00:34:52.585 A:middle
More specifically,
since the changes

00:34:52.585 --> 00:34:56.485 A:middle
in the zone are not changes that
you wish to alert a user about,

00:34:56.485 --> 00:34:59.576 A:middle
what we really want here
are silent notifications.



00:35:01.236 --> 00:35:06.476 A:middle
So in the next section, I would
like to talk to you about how

00:35:06.476 --> 00:35:09.426 A:middle
to get up and running with
subscriptions especially

00:35:09.426 --> 00:35:11.646 A:middle
when you want to use
silent subscriptions.

00:35:12.436 --> 00:35:14.446 A:middle
Let's start with brief recap.

00:35:15.136 --> 00:35:16.336 A:middle
What are subscriptions?

00:35:17.476 --> 00:35:20.316 A:middle
Subscriptions are per
user persistent queries

00:35:20.316 --> 00:35:21.446 A:middle
that you saved to the server.

00:35:22.016 --> 00:35:26.016 A:middle
They are a way for
you, for your app

00:35:26.156 --> 00:35:29.476 A:middle
to receive remote notifications
per relevant changes.

00:35:30.496 --> 00:35:33.266 A:middle
There are two types of
subscriptions, and they differ

00:35:33.266 --> 00:35:36.586 A:middle
in the way you define what a
relevant change for you is.

00:35:38.336 --> 00:35:41.496 A:middle
Number one, there are
query subscriptions

00:35:41.696 --> 00:35:43.216 A:middle
which allow you to
store a predicate.

00:35:44.006 --> 00:35:46.406 A:middle
So when the predicate
values to true,

00:35:46.606 --> 00:35:47.666 A:middle
that's your relevant change.

00:35:48.976 --> 00:35:51.356 A:middle
The second ones are
zone subscriptions

00:35:51.356 --> 00:35:53.336 A:middle
where every modification

00:35:53.336 --> 00:35:55.636 A:middle
to a zone counts as
a relevant change.

00:35:56.226 --> 00:36:02.796 A:middle
So this is clearly what we
want in the case of trying



00:35:56.226 --> 00:36:02.796 A:middle
So this is clearly what we
want in the case of trying

00:36:02.796 --> 00:36:05.686 A:middle
to get silent notifications
whenever our zone changes.

00:36:06.996 --> 00:36:10.746 A:middle
But first, let's walk through
the general setup that you need

00:36:11.076 --> 00:36:13.346 A:middle
when handling all kinds
of CloudKit subscriptions.

00:36:13.726 --> 00:36:17.316 A:middle
What I would like to
emphasize with this setup is

00:36:17.316 --> 00:36:22.216 A:middle
that you still need to go
through the motions of setting

00:36:22.216 --> 00:36:24.076 A:middle
up remote notifications

00:36:24.236 --> 00:36:26.396 A:middle
as if they were not
coming from CloudKit.

00:36:27.546 --> 00:36:28.706 A:middle
Let me show you what
I mean by that.

00:36:29.266 --> 00:36:31.956 A:middle
Number one, you still
need the APS capability

00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:34.586 A:middle
for the app ID turned on
from the developer portal.

00:36:35.256 --> 00:36:38.236 A:middle
This should get automatically
turned on for you when you turn

00:36:38.236 --> 00:36:39.416 A:middle
on the CloudKit capability.

00:36:39.866 --> 00:36:44.756 A:middle
Number two, you need to set the
APS environment key in your app

00:36:44.826 --> 00:36:47.446 A:middle
into a P list for development
while you're testing your app

00:36:47.446 --> 00:36:49.276 A:middle
and expecting remote
notifications.

00:36:51.476 --> 00:36:52.946 A:middle
Third, you still need

00:36:52.946 --> 00:36:55.256 A:middle
to register via the
UI application API.

00:36:55.986 --> 00:36:58.956 A:middle
At the very least, you
need to call register

00:36:58.956 --> 00:37:02.906 A:middle
for remote notifications
and also call user,



00:36:58.956 --> 00:37:02.906 A:middle
for remote notifications
and also call user,

00:37:03.036 --> 00:37:05.766 A:middle
register user notification
settings if you are planning

00:37:05.766 --> 00:37:10.576 A:middle
to show user notifications
in your app.

00:37:11.196 --> 00:37:14.146 A:middle
Now, since we are interested
in silent notifications

00:37:14.486 --> 00:37:16.166 A:middle
and we're dealing with
the CloudKit server

00:37:16.166 --> 00:37:19.256 A:middle
that sends us notifications,
how do we tell the server

00:37:19.966 --> 00:37:21.626 A:middle
that this should be a
silent notification?

00:37:22.736 --> 00:37:26.476 A:middle
We do that through
CKNotification info

00:37:26.596 --> 00:37:28.316 A:middle
corresponding to
our CK subscription.

00:37:28.826 --> 00:37:30.166 A:middle
That is our entry point

00:37:30.406 --> 00:37:32.886 A:middle
into telling the CloudKit
server just what kind

00:37:32.886 --> 00:37:36.146 A:middle
of a push payload should be
sent and at what priority.

00:37:36.516 --> 00:37:37.736 A:middle
Let's talk about priorities.

00:37:39.006 --> 00:37:44.426 A:middle
So like I said, we configure
our CKNotification info in a way

00:37:44.526 --> 00:37:45.916 A:middle
that tells the CloudKit server

00:37:46.156 --> 00:37:48.706 A:middle
that this is a silent
notification and it needs

00:37:48.706 --> 00:37:49.846 A:middle
to come at a low priority.

00:37:51.776 --> 00:37:54.926 A:middle
The server will send you a high
priority push if you have any

00:37:54.926 --> 00:37:57.396 A:middle
of these keys set on your
CK notification info.

00:37:57.826 --> 00:38:02.136 A:middle
Whether it's the alert body,
should badge or sound name.



00:37:57.826 --> 00:38:02.136 A:middle
Whether it's the alert body,
should badge or sound name.

00:38:03.586 --> 00:38:06.316 A:middle
These are what we call UI
keys for your subscription.

00:38:06.416 --> 00:38:07.756 A:middle
If you send any one of them,

00:38:08.176 --> 00:38:10.716 A:middle
the server sends a high
priority push that is meant

00:38:10.716 --> 00:38:11.966 A:middle
to be delivered immediately.

00:38:14.036 --> 00:38:17.726 A:middle
All other pushes are sent
at medium priority and count

00:38:17.726 --> 00:38:19.026 A:middle
as silent notifications.

00:38:21.116 --> 00:38:24.826 A:middle
So let's walk through what is
a silent notification specific

00:38:24.826 --> 00:38:28.206 A:middle
setup that you need.

00:38:28.956 --> 00:38:30.776 A:middle
Number one, you need to turn

00:38:30.776 --> 00:38:33.626 A:middle
on the remote notification
background mode for your app.

00:38:34.276 --> 00:38:36.876 A:middle
You do this through the
capabilities pane in Xcode.

00:38:37.966 --> 00:38:41.846 A:middle
You should remember
to checkmark that.

00:38:42.056 --> 00:38:43.756 A:middle
Number two, you should make sure

00:38:43.756 --> 00:38:45.766 A:middle
that you implement
the application

00:38:45.766 --> 00:38:47.346 A:middle
that you receive
remote notification,

00:38:47.706 --> 00:38:49.666 A:middle
fetch completion
handler notification

00:38:49.666 --> 00:38:51.016 A:middle
of the application delegate API.

00:38:52.696 --> 00:38:55.696 A:middle
The other version is not going
to be called in the background.

00:38:55.696 --> 00:38:58.456 A:middle
Make sure when you are
expecting silent notifications,

00:38:58.456 --> 00:38:59.966 A:middle
you have implemented
this version.



00:39:00.536 --> 00:39:06.366 A:middle
And third, once again now we
need to tell the CloudKit server

00:39:06.366 --> 00:39:08.236 A:middle
that this is going
to be a silent push,

00:39:08.786 --> 00:39:10.746 A:middle
how do we configure our
CKNotification info?

00:39:11.256 --> 00:39:14.446 A:middle
First and most importantly,

00:39:14.446 --> 00:39:17.516 A:middle
you should set the 'should send
content available' property

00:39:17.516 --> 00:39:17.986 A:middle
to true.

00:39:18.786 --> 00:39:20.296 A:middle
It tells the CloudKit server

00:39:20.296 --> 00:39:22.706 A:middle
that in your push payload it
should include the content

00:39:22.706 --> 00:39:24.766 A:middle
available key.

00:39:26.056 --> 00:39:29.766 A:middle
Secondly you should not
set any of the UI keys

00:39:29.766 --> 00:39:32.796 A:middle
that we just talked about
on that CKNotification info.

00:39:33.506 --> 00:39:35.466 A:middle
Setting any one of
these properties along

00:39:35.466 --> 00:39:38.206 A:middle
with should send content
available is not a supported

00:39:38.206 --> 00:39:40.716 A:middle
configuration and will result
in an error on the server.

00:39:43.216 --> 00:39:46.606 A:middle
So now let's talk about
silent push delivery.

00:39:46.606 --> 00:39:49.196 A:middle
We've configured everything,
we are expecting pushes.

00:39:49.566 --> 00:39:51.966 A:middle
When do we get them?

00:39:52.406 --> 00:39:55.606 A:middle
Since these notifications are
not meant to alert the user

00:39:55.606 --> 00:39:58.836 A:middle
in any way, they
are sent at a time

00:39:58.836 --> 00:40:00.326 A:middle
that is opportune
for the system.



00:39:58.836 --> 00:40:00.326 A:middle
that is opportune
for the system.

00:40:00.826 --> 00:40:03.806 A:middle
The system considers a variety
of factors when deciding

00:40:03.806 --> 00:40:04.896 A:middle
when they should get delivered.

00:40:05.516 --> 00:40:10.556 A:middle
And push delivery in
general is best effort.

00:40:11.636 --> 00:40:14.336 A:middle
What I mean by that is that
pushes could get coalesced

00:40:14.656 --> 00:40:17.276 A:middle
or even dropped depending on
the conditions of a device.

00:40:17.966 --> 00:40:21.426 A:middle
For example, if a device was
in airplane mode when a flurry

00:40:21.426 --> 00:40:24.416 A:middle
of pushes was expected,
coming out of airplane mode,

00:40:24.446 --> 00:40:27.516 A:middle
the Apple push notification
server will only send the device

00:40:27.556 --> 00:40:31.546 A:middle
the last push that was
meant to be received on it.

00:40:31.806 --> 00:40:34.976 A:middle
Now, we have ways to mitigate
this because we are dealing

00:40:34.976 --> 00:40:36.456 A:middle
with CloudKit notifications.

00:40:37.486 --> 00:40:42.656 A:middle
In particular, CloudKit server
stores all of the notifications

00:40:42.656 --> 00:40:44.646 A:middle
that were meant to be
delivered to your device

00:40:44.746 --> 00:40:46.846 A:middle
in what we call a
notification collection.

00:40:47.996 --> 00:40:50.846 A:middle
So when you do receive
a silent notification,

00:40:51.076 --> 00:40:53.796 A:middle
you should make sure
to fetch changes

00:40:53.796 --> 00:40:55.226 A:middle
from this notification
collection,

00:40:55.316 --> 00:40:58.886 A:middle
and you do that via the CKFetch
notification changes operation.

00:40:59.486 --> 00:41:04.566 A:middle
So now we are getting silent
notifications, we are checking



00:40:59.486 --> 00:41:04.566 A:middle
So now we are getting silent
notifications, we are checking

00:41:04.666 --> 00:41:06.416 A:middle
if there are any
notifications that we've missed,

00:41:07.146 --> 00:41:09.096 A:middle
and we know that
our zone has changed

00:41:09.096 --> 00:41:11.566 A:middle
which is the reason we got the
notification in the first place.

00:41:12.036 --> 00:41:15.736 A:middle
This is where we use CKFetch
record changes operation

00:41:15.826 --> 00:41:17.366 A:middle
to see what has changed
in our zone.

00:41:18.436 --> 00:41:22.446 A:middle
But once again like we've
talked about before,

00:41:22.446 --> 00:41:24.926 A:middle
we have no idea how many
things changed in that zone.

00:41:25.706 --> 00:41:28.056 A:middle
So potentially this could
be a long running operation.

00:41:28.376 --> 00:41:31.176 A:middle
If you need a little more time
for that operation to complete,

00:41:31.686 --> 00:41:32.816 A:middle
I recommend that you look

00:41:32.816 --> 00:41:35.436 A:middle
into the background task
API on UI application.

00:41:36.996 --> 00:41:39.776 A:middle
This will let you get
that extra time in order

00:41:39.776 --> 00:41:43.786 A:middle
for your operation to complete.

00:41:44.136 --> 00:41:46.346 A:middle
Now, before we start
talking about notifications,

00:41:46.926 --> 00:41:50.536 A:middle
in iOS 8 we introduced
an entirely new category

00:41:50.796 --> 00:41:53.426 A:middle
of notifications called
interactive notifications

00:41:53.646 --> 00:41:57.696 A:middle
which allow a user to interact
with pushes from banner,

00:41:57.786 --> 00:41:59.616 A:middle
alert or from a notification
center.



00:42:01.046 --> 00:42:03.776 A:middle
And we have had a lot of
requests from you to be able

00:42:03.776 --> 00:42:06.206 A:middle
to configure interactive
notifications with CloudKit.

00:42:06.716 --> 00:42:09.156 A:middle
I'm pleased to announce
with iOS 9 you can do just

00:42:09.156 --> 00:42:10.966 A:middle
that with minimal
amount of setup.

00:42:11.416 --> 00:42:15.116 A:middle
Once again if you just set
the new category property

00:42:15.396 --> 00:42:19.506 A:middle
on CKNotification
info, it corresponds

00:42:19.506 --> 00:42:21.426 A:middle
to the identifier
you that registered

00:42:21.936 --> 00:42:24.406 A:middle
with UI mutable notification
categories

00:42:24.546 --> 00:42:26.576 A:middle
when registering user
notification settings.

00:42:27.496 --> 00:42:29.916 A:middle
That is all the setup you
need to get up and running

00:42:29.916 --> 00:42:31.696 A:middle
with interactive
notifications with CloudKit.

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:38.856 A:middle
[Applause]

00:42:39.356 --> 00:42:39.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; NIHAR SHARMA: Thank you.

00:42:40.586 --> 00:42:43.526 A:middle
And with that, I would
like to start talking

00:42:43.526 --> 00:42:46.106 A:middle
about a general set
of performance tips

00:42:46.196 --> 00:42:49.116 A:middle
that you should keep in mind
and use in your apps today

00:42:49.296 --> 00:42:51.886 A:middle
when working with CloudKit.

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:56.736 A:middle
CloudKit is a highly
asynchronous API.

00:42:56.966 --> 00:43:00.436 A:middle
Most operations talk over the
network, and it is very common



00:42:56.966 --> 00:43:00.436 A:middle
Most operations talk over the
network, and it is very common

00:43:00.436 --> 00:43:03.756 A:middle
to run into situations where you
have a set of dependent tasks

00:43:04.306 --> 00:43:06.706 A:middle
and you want to maintain
some sort of ordering

00:43:06.796 --> 00:43:09.286 A:middle
in which they complete.

00:43:09.756 --> 00:43:15.056 A:middle
Now, when implementing
task management for these,

00:43:15.366 --> 00:43:18.796 A:middle
there are a couple of goals,
a couple of high level goals

00:43:18.796 --> 00:43:21.906 A:middle
that we would like
you to keep in mind.

00:43:22.056 --> 00:43:23.966 A:middle
Number one, obviously

00:43:24.276 --> 00:43:27.536 A:middle
that whatever technique
you employ allows you

00:43:27.536 --> 00:43:30.536 A:middle
to implement great error
handling for every single one

00:43:30.536 --> 00:43:33.296 A:middle
of your CloudKit tasks.

00:43:33.456 --> 00:43:35.966 A:middle
Secondly, since these are
asynchronous operations,

00:43:35.966 --> 00:43:38.536 A:middle
you should make sure to
never end up in a situation

00:43:38.536 --> 00:43:39.866 A:middle
where you block the main thread

00:43:40.276 --> 00:43:41.836 A:middle
and degrade their
UI performance.

00:43:42.376 --> 00:43:47.536 A:middle
And last but not the least, as
developers you want to make sure

00:43:47.926 --> 00:43:51.236 A:middle
that your task management
scheme is, lets you end

00:43:51.236 --> 00:43:54.376 A:middle
up with maintainable code
that is easy to reason about,

00:43:54.376 --> 00:43:56.986 A:middle
debug and extend as you add
new features to your app.

00:43:57.726 --> 00:44:01.316 A:middle
Let's take a look at a couple
of ways where we do this



00:43:57.726 --> 00:44:01.316 A:middle
Let's take a look at a couple
of ways where we do this

00:44:01.686 --> 00:44:03.826 A:middle
and some dos and don'ts.

00:44:05.636 --> 00:44:09.236 A:middle
The number one don't is
nesting convenience API calls.

00:44:09.886 --> 00:44:14.146 A:middle
Let's take a simple example.

00:44:14.296 --> 00:44:17.076 A:middle
If we had to modify one
of the attendee records

00:44:17.206 --> 00:44:20.086 A:middle
in the old schema that we
saw, once again never use

00:44:20.086 --> 00:44:21.356 A:middle
that schema in the real world.

00:44:21.796 --> 00:44:24.046 A:middle
But if you had to modify
the attendee record,

00:44:24.046 --> 00:44:25.416 A:middle
this is what you
would have to do

00:44:25.416 --> 00:44:27.036 A:middle
when using convenience
API calls.

00:44:27.386 --> 00:44:30.066 A:middle
You would first fetch
record with ID and try

00:44:30.066 --> 00:44:31.106 A:middle
to fetch the party record

00:44:31.106 --> 00:44:33.176 A:middle
that you know the
attendees are part of,

00:44:33.836 --> 00:44:36.716 A:middle
then pull out the record
ID for the attendee

00:44:36.926 --> 00:44:41.526 A:middle
from the attendees array, and
then make your modification

00:44:41.526 --> 00:44:44.256 A:middle
to the attendee's record, and
then try to save that record.

00:44:45.246 --> 00:44:48.166 A:middle
This is trying to
modify one record

00:44:48.566 --> 00:44:50.086 A:middle
with one set of dependencies.

00:44:50.296 --> 00:44:52.366 A:middle
You can see we have
ended up with code

00:44:52.846 --> 00:45:00.426 A:middle
that is just a mangled piece
of soup where you have no idea



00:44:52.846 --> 00:45:00.426 A:middle
that is just a mangled piece
of soup where you have no idea

00:45:00.556 --> 00:45:03.656 A:middle
where to handle which
error and how best

00:45:03.656 --> 00:45:05.116 A:middle
to retry those operations.

00:45:06.096 --> 00:45:09.486 A:middle
In addition to that, there
is an additional point

00:45:09.486 --> 00:45:10.176 A:middle
of concern here.

00:45:11.386 --> 00:45:14.836 A:middle
Let's say that we issue these
operations due to some sort

00:45:14.836 --> 00:45:16.296 A:middle
of user action in our app.

00:45:17.336 --> 00:45:20.716 A:middle
Now, if a subsequent
user action were

00:45:20.716 --> 00:45:22.916 A:middle
to render these tasks
unnecessary,

00:45:23.216 --> 00:45:25.676 A:middle
once you've enqueued
them, you have no way

00:45:25.676 --> 00:45:26.696 A:middle
to cancel these tasks.

00:45:27.676 --> 00:45:30.206 A:middle
So if they are potentially
long running, you are stuck

00:45:30.236 --> 00:45:34.256 A:middle
with them running, you are
stuck waiting for them.

00:45:34.476 --> 00:45:36.566 A:middle
We recommend that you
never use this approach

00:45:36.686 --> 00:45:40.666 A:middle
when managing dependent
tasks especially if you need

00:45:40.666 --> 00:45:43.526 A:middle
to make the same modification
for a batch of records.

00:45:45.356 --> 00:45:48.156 A:middle
Now, another technique that
we see is to simply get rid

00:45:48.156 --> 00:45:50.686 A:middle
of the asynchronous
nature of the API perhaps

00:45:50.806 --> 00:45:54.656 A:middle
by introducing a
semaphore and waiting on it.

00:45:55.076 --> 00:45:57.236 A:middle
This can get hairy in a
couple of situations too.

00:45:58.126 --> 00:46:00.956 A:middle
You should almost
never try to do this.



00:45:58.126 --> 00:46:00.956 A:middle
You should almost
never try to do this.

00:46:02.176 --> 00:46:06.316 A:middle
If you do, you should keep
in mind that especially

00:46:06.316 --> 00:46:08.546 A:middle
if you wait forever for
operations to complete,

00:46:08.546 --> 00:46:10.916 A:middle
it it is very easy
for you to end

00:46:10.916 --> 00:46:12.686 A:middle
up with circular
dependencies that end

00:46:12.686 --> 00:46:15.726 A:middle
up causing a deadlock
in your app.

00:46:15.726 --> 00:46:19.226 A:middle
Or if you were to ever use
this practice on a main thread,

00:46:19.846 --> 00:46:23.176 A:middle
this will block your UI
right away on an operation

00:46:23.176 --> 00:46:25.406 A:middle
that is likely waiting
on the network and result

00:46:25.406 --> 00:46:26.806 A:middle
in a terrible user experience.

00:46:28.636 --> 00:46:30.806 A:middle
So we don't really recommend it.

00:46:33.596 --> 00:46:36.456 A:middle
What we do recommend is
for you to take a look

00:46:36.456 --> 00:46:40.336 A:middle
at the dependency management
API that NSOperation offers.

00:46:41.576 --> 00:46:43.186 A:middle
This is what I mean by that API.

00:46:44.076 --> 00:46:47.316 A:middle
NSOperation lets you easily
add and remove dependencies

00:46:47.316 --> 00:46:48.866 A:middle
between other NSOperations.

00:46:49.396 --> 00:46:53.776 A:middle
Let's take a look at how
this works with CKOperations

00:46:53.826 --> 00:46:55.866 A:middle
that are a subclass
of NSOperations.

00:46:57.856 --> 00:47:01.156 A:middle
If we have two dependent
fetch records operations



00:46:57.856 --> 00:47:01.156 A:middle
If we have two dependent
fetch records operations

00:47:01.706 --> 00:47:05.206 A:middle
and the second one should not
begin before the first one is

00:47:05.206 --> 00:47:09.046 A:middle
completed, all you need to do is
set up both of those operations

00:47:09.596 --> 00:47:13.096 A:middle
and add the first fetch as
a dependency on the second

00:47:13.096 --> 00:47:14.936 A:middle
and enqueue both of
those operations.

00:47:15.926 --> 00:47:19.816 A:middle
This will guarantee that the
second fetch does not start

00:47:20.136 --> 00:47:21.546 A:middle
before the first
fetch is finished.

00:47:22.536 --> 00:47:25.586 A:middle
You can see this offers
you a logical way to think

00:47:25.586 --> 00:47:27.916 A:middle
about the errors for
particular operations

00:47:28.246 --> 00:47:30.976 A:middle
and at the same time
manage dependencies for them

00:47:31.096 --> 00:47:34.086 A:middle
in a convenient manner.

00:47:34.716 --> 00:47:37.886 A:middle
Now, when thinking
about NSOperations

00:47:37.886 --> 00:47:39.476 A:middle
from a performance context,

00:47:40.936 --> 00:47:44.056 A:middle
there is an additional
distinction that I would

00:47:44.056 --> 00:47:45.366 A:middle
like you guys to think about.

00:47:46.796 --> 00:47:49.256 A:middle
Not all NSOperations
are created equal.

00:47:50.026 --> 00:47:51.396 A:middle
Some of them may
have been created

00:47:51.396 --> 00:47:53.196 A:middle
because of an explicit
user action

00:47:53.196 --> 00:47:56.556 A:middle
in your apps while others may
represent background tasks

00:47:56.746 --> 00:47:58.026 A:middle
that are of lower priority.

00:47:59.396 --> 00:48:02.246 A:middle
To indicate this notion
of relative importance



00:47:59.396 --> 00:48:02.246 A:middle
To indicate this notion
of relative importance

00:48:02.246 --> 00:48:04.146 A:middle
between NSOperations
to the system,

00:48:04.506 --> 00:48:07.236 A:middle
in iOS 8 we introduced
the quality

00:48:07.236 --> 00:48:09.646 A:middle
of service property
on NSOperations.

00:48:11.056 --> 00:48:14.916 A:middle
This property lets you indicate
the nature and importance

00:48:14.916 --> 00:48:17.596 A:middle
of work encapsulated
by your NSOperation.

00:48:18.806 --> 00:48:21.276 A:middle
These are the various
service levels

00:48:21.276 --> 00:48:24.676 A:middle
that this property can take,
and I recommend that you check

00:48:24.676 --> 00:48:26.936 A:middle
out the documentation for
a description of each one

00:48:26.936 --> 00:48:28.686 A:middle
of these values and
their significance.

00:48:29.466 --> 00:48:32.086 A:middle
But what is important to keep
in mind here is that each

00:48:32.086 --> 00:48:35.206 A:middle
of these service values
directly affects the priority

00:48:35.206 --> 00:48:38.946 A:middle
with which the NSOperation is
allocated system resources,

00:48:39.356 --> 00:48:43.166 A:middle
like CPU time, disk resources,
as well as network resources.

00:48:45.086 --> 00:48:49.976 A:middle
Now, with CloudKit last year, we
wanted to give you a similar way

00:48:49.976 --> 00:48:53.276 A:middle
to be able to opt your
lower priority CKOperations

00:48:53.466 --> 00:48:55.196 A:middle
into discretionary
network behavior.

00:48:56.336 --> 00:48:57.916 A:middle
What we mean by that, is

00:48:57.916 --> 00:49:01.326 A:middle
that for your nonuser
initiated tasks, for example,



00:48:57.916 --> 00:49:01.326 A:middle
that for your nonuser
initiated tasks, for example,

00:49:01.766 --> 00:49:04.416 A:middle
pre-fetching content for
the user like we just went

00:49:04.416 --> 00:49:07.326 A:middle
through by using CKRecords
fetch record changes operation

00:49:07.326 --> 00:49:09.386 A:middle
in response to silent
notifications.

00:49:10.306 --> 00:49:13.236 A:middle
You want those tasks to opt
into discretionary behavior

00:49:13.236 --> 00:49:16.356 A:middle
so that the system waits
for an opportune time

00:49:16.936 --> 00:49:18.616 A:middle
to perform those
network requests.

00:49:19.776 --> 00:49:22.376 A:middle
The system takes a variety
of factors into account

00:49:22.586 --> 00:49:25.436 A:middle
when deciding when to
perform them, for exmple,

00:49:26.146 --> 00:49:27.536 A:middle
cellular connectivity.

00:49:27.946 --> 00:49:31.936 A:middle
The system might wait
for network connectivity

00:49:31.936 --> 00:49:35.546 A:middle
to improve before sending
out those requests.

00:49:35.546 --> 00:49:36.786 A:middle
Also power conditions.

00:49:37.276 --> 00:49:38.796 A:middle
If a user is running
low on battery

00:49:39.036 --> 00:49:41.956 A:middle
or the device is not currently
charging, the system will wait

00:49:41.956 --> 00:49:45.236 A:middle
for power conditions to improve
before sending those requests.

00:49:46.176 --> 00:49:49.816 A:middle
We did this by exposing the
user background session property

00:49:49.896 --> 00:49:50.896 A:middle
on CKOperations.

00:49:52.096 --> 00:49:58.796 A:middle
With iOS 9 we saw an opportunity
here to greatly simplify

00:49:59.086 --> 00:50:03.496 A:middle
and unify these things, these
two concepts by using quality



00:49:59.086 --> 00:50:03.496 A:middle
and unify these things, these
two concepts by using quality

00:50:03.496 --> 00:50:06.616 A:middle
of service to infer
your network behavior,

00:50:06.956 --> 00:50:09.946 A:middle
and at the same time
pull in everything else

00:50:09.946 --> 00:50:12.646 A:middle
that a given service level
already indicates to the system.

00:50:13.466 --> 00:50:14.756 A:middle
So we are doing just that.

00:50:16.296 --> 00:50:18.526 A:middle
By deprecating the user's
background session property

00:50:19.116 --> 00:50:22.146 A:middle
and recommending that you start
setting quality of service

00:50:22.326 --> 00:50:24.086 A:middle
on all of your CKOperations.

00:50:25.776 --> 00:50:29.776 A:middle
Now, in the context of network
behavior, you can set either

00:50:29.776 --> 00:50:33.456 A:middle
of the service levels user
interactive or user initiated

00:50:33.456 --> 00:50:35.746 A:middle
to opt out of this
discretionary behavior.

00:50:38.376 --> 00:50:41.156 A:middle
And for discretionary behavior,

00:50:41.156 --> 00:50:43.776 A:middle
you can either set
the value utility

00:50:44.816 --> 00:50:45.956 A:middle
in which case we will try

00:50:45.956 --> 00:50:49.526 A:middle
to infer whether you should be
opted into discretionary based

00:50:49.526 --> 00:50:53.966 A:middle
on whether the requesting app is
foreground or not or background

00:50:54.756 --> 00:50:57.396 A:middle
which will always result in
discretionary network behavior.

00:50:57.896 --> 00:51:03.126 A:middle
Please keep in mind that if
you build your apps with iOS 9



00:50:57.896 --> 00:51:03.126 A:middle
Please keep in mind that if
you build your apps with iOS 9

00:51:03.126 --> 00:51:05.436 A:middle
and OS X El Capitan or later,

00:51:06.466 --> 00:51:09.796 A:middle
all new CKOperations will
have the background quality

00:51:09.796 --> 00:51:10.956 A:middle
of service by default.

00:51:11.826 --> 00:51:15.186 A:middle
You should make sure that you
audit all of your CKOperations,

00:51:16.166 --> 00:51:17.546 A:middle
take a look at what
is the importance

00:51:17.546 --> 00:51:18.736 A:middle
of work that they represent.

00:51:19.076 --> 00:51:20.486 A:middle
Be a good systems citizen

00:51:20.726 --> 00:51:24.946 A:middle
and set the appropriate
QS values on them.

00:51:25.206 --> 00:51:26.976 A:middle
NSOperation is very
powerful API,

00:51:27.216 --> 00:51:28.796 A:middle
and there's a lot more
you can do with it.

00:51:29.556 --> 00:51:32.816 A:middle
If you want to learn more, I
highly recommend that you go

00:51:32.816 --> 00:51:35.696 A:middle
to the advanced NSOperation
session tomorrow morning

00:51:36.396 --> 00:51:38.216 A:middle
in Presidio.

00:51:38.216 --> 00:51:43.086 A:middle
In summary, I'd like to
reiterate that error handling

00:51:43.086 --> 00:51:45.006 A:middle
for your CloudKit code is vital.

00:51:45.336 --> 00:51:48.846 A:middle
It is as important as any
feature, and we would like you

00:51:48.846 --> 00:51:51.156 A:middle
to take a look, go back
today and take a look

00:51:51.156 --> 00:51:53.336 A:middle
at all your operations,
see what kinds

00:51:53.336 --> 00:51:54.386 A:middle
of errors have you been hitting,

00:51:54.666 --> 00:51:56.926 A:middle
and if you followed the
general guidelines we talked

00:51:56.926 --> 00:52:00.336 A:middle
about today in handling them.



00:51:56.926 --> 00:52:00.336 A:middle
about today in handling them.

00:52:00.526 --> 00:52:03.036 A:middle
Number two, start
batching your requests.

00:52:03.306 --> 00:52:06.966 A:middle
Whenever you see your app
using the convenience API,

00:52:07.426 --> 00:52:10.506 A:middle
working on one item
at a time and doing

00:52:10.506 --> 00:52:11.386 A:middle
that in multiple places,

00:52:11.386 --> 00:52:14.816 A:middle
think with about using the
CKOperation version of that API

00:52:15.506 --> 00:52:16.716 A:middle
and batching those requests up.

00:52:17.226 --> 00:52:19.176 A:middle
You will not only
improve the efficiency

00:52:19.536 --> 00:52:22.496 A:middle
that your operations execute
with in the system in general,

00:52:22.896 --> 00:52:25.526 A:middle
you will also save your
own network request quota.

00:52:27.456 --> 00:52:29.426 A:middle
Think about schema tradeoffs.

00:52:29.606 --> 00:52:33.596 A:middle
We've seen two cases where
our schema tradeoffs came --

00:52:33.596 --> 00:52:38.336 A:middle
let us take advantage
of optimizations.

00:52:38.496 --> 00:52:41.376 A:middle
For example when we
added the thumbnail key

00:52:41.376 --> 00:52:45.546 A:middle
to our photo record, we were
able to optimize our download

00:52:45.546 --> 00:52:48.156 A:middle
by just downloading
the data that we need.

00:52:48.906 --> 00:52:52.036 A:middle
And in another case we were
able to avoid an entire class

00:52:52.036 --> 00:52:56.896 A:middle
of errors when we avoided the
same party record being modified

00:52:57.076 --> 00:52:58.486 A:middle
when photo records
were stored on it.

00:52:59.096 --> 00:53:01.276 A:middle
So think about your
schema carefully



00:52:59.096 --> 00:53:01.276 A:middle
So think about your
schema carefully

00:53:02.336 --> 00:53:03.366 A:middle
when designing features.

00:53:03.916 --> 00:53:08.356 A:middle
And last but not the least,
configure your CKOperations.

00:53:08.356 --> 00:53:11.206 A:middle
They have, they are
a very powerful API

00:53:11.206 --> 00:53:14.066 A:middle
and they offer a ton of
optimizations you can make

00:53:14.236 --> 00:53:16.676 A:middle
to the actual network
request that gets sent

00:53:16.676 --> 00:53:17.876 A:middle
to the CloudKit servers.

00:53:19.816 --> 00:53:22.886 A:middle
For more information please
check out our documentation

00:53:22.886 --> 00:53:25.036 A:middle
on developer.Apple.com/CloudKit.

00:53:25.766 --> 00:53:28.716 A:middle
For all the other questions and
answers, the technical support,

00:53:28.716 --> 00:53:31.886 A:middle
the forums and the CK support
site are a great place.

00:53:32.276 --> 00:53:35.466 A:middle
For general queries, please
e-mail CloudKit@Apple.com.

00:53:36.246 --> 00:53:38.996 A:middle
We have had some great
related sessions this week.

00:53:38.996 --> 00:53:41.206 A:middle
I invite you to check them
out when you go back today

00:53:41.526 --> 00:53:44.096 A:middle
to Learn all that's
new with Web services

00:53:44.546 --> 00:53:45.926 A:middle
and what else is
new in CloudKit.

00:53:46.976 --> 00:53:49.326 A:middle
We have one more Lab
coming up tomorrow morning

00:53:49.326 --> 00:53:51.136 A:middle
at 9 in Frameworks lab D.

00:53:51.136 --> 00:53:54.316 A:middle
Bring your questions and
we'd be happy to answer them.

00:53:54.886 --> 00:53:55.196 A:middle
Thank you.

00:53:56.516 --> 00:54:00.500 A:middle
[Applause]
