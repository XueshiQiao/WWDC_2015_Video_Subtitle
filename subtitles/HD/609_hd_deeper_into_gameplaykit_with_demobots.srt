00:00:23.516 --> 00:00:28.136 A:middle
[Applause]

00:00:28.636 --> 00:00:29.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; DAVE ADDEY: Hello.

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.866 A:middle
Welcome to Deeper into
GameplayKit with DemoBots.

00:00:32.906 --> 00:00:36.166 A:middle
We created a new game sample
this year called DemoBots.

00:00:36.896 --> 00:00:38.336 A:middle
If you would like to
play along at home,

00:00:38.596 --> 00:00:39.876 A:middle
you can download
the sample today

00:00:40.186 --> 00:00:42.766 A:middle
from
developer.apple.com/spritekit.

00:00:44.046 --> 00:00:46.526 A:middle
This game takes advantage of
lots of the things you learned

00:00:46.526 --> 00:00:48.826 A:middle
about in the What's New
in SpriteKit session

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.406 A:middle
and Introducing GameplayKit.

00:00:50.486 --> 00:00:53.216 A:middle
Check it out if you couldn't.

00:00:53.216 --> 00:00:57.506 A:middle
We couldn't make a
game called DemoBots

00:00:58.276 --> 00:01:00.086 A:middle
without giving you a demo.



00:00:58.276 --> 00:01:00.086 A:middle
without giving you a demo.

00:01:00.336 --> 00:01:02.036 A:middle
Let's take a look and
see how the game plays.

00:01:07.956 --> 00:01:12.846 A:middle
We start a new game, you're
PlayerBot, this guy here.

00:01:13.586 --> 00:01:17.226 A:middle
Your job is to find and
fix all of the bad TaskBots

00:01:17.406 --> 00:01:19.176 A:middle
on each level before
the clock runs out.

00:01:20.036 --> 00:01:22.476 A:middle
Here we have two good TaskBots,
you can tell they're good,

00:01:22.476 --> 00:01:23.476 A:middle
because they've got green faces.

00:01:24.576 --> 00:01:27.256 A:middle
If I run around the corner here,
we find the first bad TaskBot.

00:01:27.526 --> 00:01:29.716 A:middle
He's a GroundBot in this case.

00:01:29.716 --> 00:01:32.326 A:middle
When he spots me, he will
charge toward me and attack me.

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:33.956 A:middle
I lose some charge.

00:01:34.796 --> 00:01:35.246 A:middle
That's okay.

00:01:35.286 --> 00:01:37.106 A:middle
I have a beam to zap him with.

00:01:37.106 --> 00:01:41.216 A:middle
After I zapped him for a few
seconds he's fixed and green.

00:01:41.446 --> 00:01:42.086 A:middle
Let's see where he's going.

00:01:44.106 --> 00:01:46.156 A:middle
Here we have another
bad TaskBots,

00:01:46.236 --> 00:01:48.166 A:middle
I have to fix him as well.

00:01:49.726 --> 00:01:51.146 A:middle
There are two more on
this level that I need

00:01:51.146 --> 00:01:52.796 A:middle
to fix before the
timer runs out.

00:01:53.376 --> 00:01:55.326 A:middle
Unfortunately they
have a tendency

00:01:55.326 --> 00:01:56.516 A:middle
to attack one another as well.

00:01:57.196 --> 00:01:58.986 A:middle
They can turn each other bad.

00:01:59.736 --> 00:02:01.406 A:middle
That's what happened there.



00:01:59.736 --> 00:02:01.406 A:middle
That's what happened there.

00:02:02.596 --> 00:02:09.936 A:middle
Once all of them are fixed
the level is complete.

00:02:10.515 --> 00:02:13.356 A:middle
[Applause]

00:02:13.856 --> 00:02:14.776 A:middle
There's a level 2.

00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:20.096 A:middle
Level 2 introduces a new
character, FlyingBot,

00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:23.096 A:middle
here is a FlyingBot on the side
hanging out, doing his thing.

00:02:23.836 --> 00:02:25.426 A:middle
If you find a bad FlyingBot,

00:02:25.486 --> 00:02:29.846 A:middle
they have a different
attack.When we bump into him,

00:02:30.206 --> 00:02:32.316 A:middle
he does a blast attack
affecting everybody

00:02:32.316 --> 00:02:33.236 A:middle
within a certain radius.

00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:37.496 A:middle
The good news, if you fix
one, they do a good attack

00:02:37.496 --> 00:02:40.096 A:middle
that will cure any other
FlyingBot within range.

00:02:40.856 --> 00:02:41.806 A:middle
Follow him over here.

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:47.856 A:middle
He's almost certainly going
to bump into another bad one.

00:02:47.856 --> 00:02:48.426 A:middle
He avoided him.

00:02:48.556 --> 00:02:50.146 A:middle
Good. I can cure
this one as well.

00:02:50.846 --> 00:02:53.676 A:middle
He's almost certainly going to
do a really, really silly thing,

00:02:54.116 --> 00:02:56.366 A:middle
to go all the way around
here to a great big nest

00:02:56.466 --> 00:02:57.506 A:middle
of the things around the corner.

00:02:58.386 --> 00:02:59.476 A:middle
This is almost a certainty.



00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:04.406 A:middle
We can use his benevolent
blast after he's been made bad,

00:03:04.816 --> 00:03:14.376 A:middle
he can cure one, two,
all of them in one go.

00:03:14.376 --> 00:03:17.986 A:middle
[Laughter] One more to go.

00:03:18.446 --> 00:03:22.756 A:middle
Oh no! [Laughter] This
is not going well.

00:03:25.136 --> 00:03:25.886 A:middle
[Laughter] One more.

00:03:27.846 --> 00:03:28.596 A:middle
Then the level is complete.

00:03:29.516 --> 00:03:34.906 A:middle
[Applause]

00:03:35.406 --> 00:03:36.286 A:middle
So that's DemoBots.

00:03:36.746 --> 00:03:39.056 A:middle
I would like to take
a look at tools

00:03:39.056 --> 00:03:43.326 A:middle
and technologies we have used
to make this game a reality.

00:03:43.326 --> 00:03:45.626 A:middle
You saw our TaskBots had lots

00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:47.246 A:middle
of animation states
they went through.

00:03:47.246 --> 00:03:52.756 A:middle
A thing we tried to do is keep
the textures, images we needed

00:03:52.756 --> 00:03:55.516 A:middle
for those to a minimum to
keep the app size realistic.

00:03:55.516 --> 00:03:59.886 A:middle
We decided to keep the new
action editor in SpriteKit



00:04:00.276 --> 00:04:01.136 A:middle
to create the actions as --

00:04:01.136 --> 00:04:03.056 A:middle
animations as actions
rather than textures.

00:04:03.726 --> 00:04:07.086 A:middle
The zap animation you
see, the zap beam,

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:10.606 A:middle
that's a reference action
we have made and applied

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:12.036 A:middle
to both the GroundBot
and FlyingBot.

00:04:12.496 --> 00:04:15.426 A:middle
If we click into that action
we can see it is made of lots

00:04:15.426 --> 00:04:17.495 A:middle
of small move actions
one after another.

00:04:19.296 --> 00:04:22.826 A:middle
Because it is a reference
action we can create it once

00:04:23.086 --> 00:04:26.156 A:middle
and apply it to all
TaskBots we have regardless

00:04:26.156 --> 00:04:27.266 A:middle
of the orientation.

00:04:28.406 --> 00:04:31.796 A:middle
Because it is a reference
action, we can create it once

00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:34.666 A:middle
and then go and change
it, the source,

00:04:34.836 --> 00:04:36.836 A:middle
seeing that change going
everywhere, we don't have

00:04:36.836 --> 00:04:38.706 A:middle
to change it in multiple places.

00:04:40.826 --> 00:04:43.946 A:middle
We use the action editor to
create the beam animation.

00:04:44.476 --> 00:04:47.556 A:middle
It is only fired for so many
seconds, we want that beam

00:04:47.636 --> 00:04:51.306 A:middle
to decay over time and we
create that actions editor too

00:04:51.306 --> 00:04:56.066 A:middle
so that we can see it visually
and use it in the game.

00:04:56.066 --> 00:04:58.276 A:middle
All of the assets in the
game have been created

00:04:58.276 --> 00:05:00.056 A:middle
in asset catalogs and out



00:04:58.276 --> 00:05:00.056 A:middle
in asset catalogs and out

00:05:00.056 --> 00:05:03.136 A:middle
of Xcode 7 these asset
catalogs are converted

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:04.616 A:middle
to texture atlases for us.

00:05:05.336 --> 00:05:07.906 A:middle
That means that we get the
best possible draw performance

00:05:07.906 --> 00:05:09.876 A:middle
when used in a game.

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:11.086 A:middle
We have a lot of these images.

00:05:11.426 --> 00:05:14.456 A:middle
It also gives us a way to
specify the right images to use

00:05:14.806 --> 00:05:15.696 A:middle
for different devices.

00:05:16.926 --> 00:05:18.456 A:middle
This helps us to
optimize the size further.

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:22.596 A:middle
When we were designing our
levels we used a reference

00:05:22.596 --> 00:05:26.736 A:middle
height of 768 points, the yellow
box there, that's our reference

00:05:26.736 --> 00:05:29.346 A:middle
for how much level we wanted
to be visible onscreen.

00:05:30.166 --> 00:05:35.106 A:middle
At that size our PlayerBot is
120 points, and now if we use

00:05:35.106 --> 00:05:39.826 A:middle
that level on an iPad, the
iPad is also 768 points,

00:05:40.086 --> 00:05:41.356 A:middle
so we'll know the size of
the PlayerBot on screen,

00:05:41.356 --> 00:05:43.676 A:middle
and he's going to be 120
points and we can work

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:45.796 A:middle
out the image size we need

00:05:45.796 --> 00:05:47.416 A:middle
to get a sharp image
of him onscreen.

00:05:48.726 --> 00:05:52.906 A:middle
If we scale that level down
to an iPhone with, say,

00:05:52.906 --> 00:05:55.956 A:middle
a 320 point height, he
actually is a bit smaller,

00:05:56.126 --> 00:05:57.116 A:middle
he'll be 50 points high.

00:05:58.246 --> 00:06:00.376 A:middle
We don't need such a
high resolution texture



00:05:58.246 --> 00:06:00.376 A:middle
We don't need such a
high resolution texture

00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:02.526 A:middle
as on the iPad and
we can save space.

00:06:04.006 --> 00:06:08.186 A:middle
If we look at all of the devices
that we support with DemoBots,

00:06:08.186 --> 00:06:12.846 A:middle
iPad, iPhone and Mac, as that
Scene height scales we can work

00:06:12.846 --> 00:06:14.446 A:middle
out the corresponding
player height.

00:06:15.086 --> 00:06:20.876 A:middle
The iPhone 6 is slightly bigger
than the 4S through the 5S,

00:06:21.046 --> 00:06:24.226 A:middle
we used the same assets, it
is so small, you don't notice.

00:06:26.126 --> 00:06:31.186 A:middle
This then means you work out
the 1X, 2X, 3X assets we need

00:06:31.566 --> 00:06:34.146 A:middle
to make them look sharp
without using any more pixels

00:06:34.146 --> 00:06:35.176 A:middle
than we needed to.

00:06:35.176 --> 00:06:38.326 A:middle
We rounded the iPhone 6
Plus down to 180 pixels just

00:06:38.326 --> 00:06:41.276 A:middle
to keep things simple.

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:43.976 A:middle
We can set up the assets
we want for each device.

00:06:44.756 --> 00:06:46.216 A:middle
We have a lot of
these in the game.

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:48.886 A:middle
I really, really do
mean a lot of them.

00:06:48.956 --> 00:06:49.526 A:middle
There are thousands.

00:06:51.396 --> 00:06:54.196 A:middle
All of these character
assets are actually generated

00:06:54.196 --> 00:06:56.276 A:middle
from a 3D rendering output.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:57.686 A:middle
Which we can also connect.

00:06:58.596 --> 00:07:02.186 A:middle
We automated that creation
of the asset catalogs too.



00:06:58.596 --> 00:07:02.186 A:middle
We automated that creation
of the asset catalogs too.

00:07:02.836 --> 00:07:05.476 A:middle
The JSON file here,
the one frame

00:07:05.476 --> 00:07:07.576 A:middle
of the PlayerBot's
walk animation,

00:07:08.336 --> 00:07:09.886 A:middle
and we can create
these automatically,

00:07:09.886 --> 00:07:12.746 A:middle
this is what Xcode creates
with the asset catalogs

00:07:13.426 --> 00:07:16.226 A:middle
and we can automate the process
of picking the right images

00:07:16.226 --> 00:07:20.406 A:middle
for the right device and we'll
release the Asset Catalog format

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:24.676 A:middle
reference in a future seed
to make it easier for you

00:07:25.096 --> 00:07:27.516 A:middle
to create these yourself
as well.

00:07:27.516 --> 00:07:29.036 A:middle
Another SpriteKit
feature that we used

00:07:29.036 --> 00:07:33.546 A:middle
in the game was SKCameraNode,
before that, if we wanted

00:07:34.066 --> 00:07:37.026 A:middle
to move the view around
the level, we actually had

00:07:37.026 --> 00:07:37.966 A:middle
to move the world, we had

00:07:37.966 --> 00:07:39.756 A:middle
to move the level
itself beneath the view.

00:07:41.816 --> 00:07:44.406 A:middle
with SKCameraNode
things are much simpler,

00:07:45.086 --> 00:07:46.666 A:middle
the camera is a node
in the scene.

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:47.496 A:middle
It has a position.

00:07:48.186 --> 00:07:50.796 A:middle
Because it has a position,
we can move it around just

00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:51.716 A:middle
by changing that position.

00:07:51.886 --> 00:07:52.756 A:middle
Same as any other node.

00:07:52.756 --> 00:07:55.636 A:middle
It is easier to change where
the view is currently looking.

00:07:57.976 --> 00:08:01.046 A:middle
Because it is a node we can
do node-like things with it.



00:07:57.976 --> 00:08:01.046 A:middle
Because it is a node we can
do node-like things with it.

00:08:01.516 --> 00:08:03.536 A:middle
We can apply constraints
to that node for example.

00:08:04.096 --> 00:08:06.826 A:middle
We can use this to constrain
the node's Camera position

00:08:07.106 --> 00:08:12.476 A:middle
to a PlayerBot position,
when he runs to the corner

00:08:12.476 --> 00:08:16.986 A:middle
of the screen, we have a lot
of black space around him,

00:08:16.986 --> 00:08:21.106 A:middle
not as much level as we
would like on the screen.

00:08:21.106 --> 00:08:23.966 A:middle
We can make it better to
use a second restraint

00:08:24.726 --> 00:08:27.756 A:middle
to make sure we're never too
near the edge of the level.

00:08:28.126 --> 00:08:29.026 A:middle
That's how that looks.

00:08:30.206 --> 00:08:32.525 A:middle
We follow the PlayerBot
generally speaking

00:08:33.155 --> 00:08:35.746 A:middle
but if he's near we
stop following him

00:08:35.806 --> 00:08:36.986 A:middle
and keep more level onscreen.

00:08:37.686 --> 00:08:41.926 A:middle
This is easier to see when
the enemy bots attack you.

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:45.256 A:middle
How do we do that?

00:08:45.676 --> 00:08:48.276 A:middle
We start by working out
the banding rectangle

00:08:48.476 --> 00:08:49.386 A:middle
of the entire level.

00:08:50.506 --> 00:08:53.776 A:middle
We then make a smaller
rectangle in set from that based

00:08:53.776 --> 00:08:55.246 A:middle
on the screens width and height

00:08:55.246 --> 00:08:56.286 A:middle
that they're viewing
the game on.

00:08:57.166 --> 00:09:00.716 A:middle
We make sure that the Camera can
never move outside of that box.



00:08:57.166 --> 00:09:00.716 A:middle
We make sure that the Camera can
never move outside of that box.

00:09:00.716 --> 00:09:02.206 A:middle
We constrain it to
that rectangle.

00:09:03.216 --> 00:09:04.676 A:middle
Then when the Camera moves

00:09:04.676 --> 00:09:07.106 A:middle
around following the player
it never gets too near

00:09:07.326 --> 00:09:11.206 A:middle
to the edge of the level.

00:09:11.206 --> 00:09:15.576 A:middle
Because the Camera is a node we
can also add child nodes to it,

00:09:15.626 --> 00:09:17.516 A:middle
which is good for
heads-up displays

00:09:17.516 --> 00:09:19.326 A:middle
like our timer label
we have in the game.

00:09:20.706 --> 00:09:21.876 A:middle
We don't want this
label to move,

00:09:21.876 --> 00:09:23.206 A:middle
we want it to stay
top and center.

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:26.536 A:middle
So we add it as a child of the
Camera rather than had a child

00:09:26.536 --> 00:09:28.676 A:middle
of the Scene, that way,
as the Camera moves

00:09:28.676 --> 00:09:31.826 A:middle
around the label moves
with it and it is easier

00:09:31.826 --> 00:09:34.206 A:middle
to keep the permanent features
onscreen in the right place.

00:09:37.316 --> 00:09:39.426 A:middle
Those are some of the
SpriteKit features

00:09:39.426 --> 00:09:40.456 A:middle
that we have used in the game.

00:09:41.036 --> 00:09:43.106 A:middle
Let's look at some if of the
GameplayKit ones we used.

00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:46.896 A:middle
the first is GKStateMachine,
you would have seen

00:09:46.896 --> 00:09:49.656 A:middle
from the GameplayKit talk how
you can use state machines

00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:52.806 A:middle
to track what's going on
with characters and levels

00:09:52.976 --> 00:09:54.086 A:middle
and other elements of your game.

00:09:55.116 --> 00:09:57.286 A:middle
We use this amongst other
things for the PlayerBot,

00:09:57.896 --> 00:09:58.936 A:middle
this is the states he has.

00:09:59.336 --> 00:10:00.936 A:middle
He starts in his Appear state



00:09:59.336 --> 00:10:00.936 A:middle
He starts in his Appear state

00:10:01.006 --> 00:10:03.316 A:middle
where he teleports
into the game.

00:10:03.926 --> 00:10:07.606 A:middle
The nice thing about using
custom states for this is

00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:10.256 A:middle
that they can make sure that
the right thing happens.

00:10:10.256 --> 00:10:15.026 A:middle
They start and it starts a
timer, after the right amount

00:10:15.606 --> 00:10:18.426 A:middle
of time passes, it
moves straight

00:10:18.586 --> 00:10:21.236 A:middle
to the player control state
and turns on the input use

00:10:21.236 --> 00:10:22.756 A:middle
so you can control it.

00:10:24.376 --> 00:10:29.096 A:middle
If he's hit we move into the
Hit state, when we have this,

00:10:29.096 --> 00:10:32.346 A:middle
we enter a different
animation, the jump animation

00:10:32.346 --> 00:10:35.896 A:middle
and the player can't
be controlled when hit

00:10:35.986 --> 00:10:39.306 A:middle
and it turns off
input, tracks the state,

00:10:39.726 --> 00:10:41.616 A:middle
when the time has
passed, move him back

00:10:41.736 --> 00:10:44.376 A:middle
to the player control state.

00:10:44.376 --> 00:10:47.756 A:middle
If we get hit enough
times we have to recharge

00:10:47.796 --> 00:10:50.786 A:middle
and instead the Hit state
moves to the Recharging state.

00:10:51.616 --> 00:10:53.446 A:middle
That tracks how long we
have been recharging for.

00:10:53.926 --> 00:10:55.266 A:middle
The state actually does the job

00:10:55.476 --> 00:10:57.106 A:middle
of adding more charge
back on to the player.

00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:00.276 A:middle
Eventually when recharged,
it goes back



00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:00.276 A:middle
Eventually when recharged,
it goes back

00:11:00.336 --> 00:11:01.336 A:middle
to the PlayerControlled state.

00:11:01.336 --> 00:11:05.576 A:middle
That's a reasonably
complex set of behaviors

00:11:05.576 --> 00:11:06.426 A:middle
that the player can have.

00:11:07.216 --> 00:11:11.026 A:middle
By using a state machine to
not only codify the states,

00:11:11.026 --> 00:11:13.826 A:middle
make them happen, define the
right things to happen moving

00:11:14.096 --> 00:11:17.386 A:middle
from state to state it
is easier to make sure

00:11:17.386 --> 00:11:19.016 A:middle
that only the right thing
could happen in game.

00:11:19.016 --> 00:11:23.786 A:middle
Our player Bot can't do
something we don't want him to.

00:11:23.786 --> 00:11:27.456 A:middle
We use this also
for the game itself.

00:11:28.346 --> 00:11:30.646 A:middle
We have an active state
when you play a level,

00:11:31.526 --> 00:11:33.706 A:middle
if we hit pause we go
into a pause state.

00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:37.186 A:middle
This handles overlay,
by removing that overlay

00:11:37.446 --> 00:11:38.596 A:middle
when you move out
of the pause state.

00:11:39.566 --> 00:11:41.976 A:middle
If I complete the level,
we have a success state.

00:11:42.486 --> 00:11:45.406 A:middle
Again, this handles all of the
tasks of showing the buttons

00:11:45.586 --> 00:11:47.266 A:middle
and overlay for when
we succeeded.

00:11:47.526 --> 00:11:49.526 A:middle
The state knows the right things
to do in these situations.

00:11:50.826 --> 00:11:55.036 A:middle
Another aspect of GameplayKit
we have used is entities

00:11:55.226 --> 00:11:55.906 A:middle
and components.

00:11:56.776 --> 00:11:59.406 A:middle
Now components are a
really good way to package

00:11:59.406 --> 00:12:01.306 A:middle
up self-contained
pieces of functionality



00:11:59.406 --> 00:12:01.306 A:middle
up self-contained
pieces of functionality

00:12:01.306 --> 00:12:03.886 A:middle
that are shared amongst
different entities in the game.

00:12:04.586 --> 00:12:06.786 A:middle
We have three entities,
we have PlayerBot,

00:12:07.456 --> 00:12:09.016 A:middle
GroundBot and FlyingBot.

00:12:10.356 --> 00:12:11.656 A:middle
They have some things in common.

00:12:12.416 --> 00:12:14.036 A:middle
They all need to be
rendered into the Scene

00:12:14.036 --> 00:12:15.266 A:middle
and they all need a shadow.

00:12:15.656 --> 00:12:17.126 A:middle
So we have a render component

00:12:17.126 --> 00:12:18.546 A:middle
and a shadow component
to do these things.

00:12:19.506 --> 00:12:22.896 A:middle
They also all have animation,
physics and intelligence,

00:12:22.896 --> 00:12:25.006 A:middle
which is the name we've given
to the state machine tracking .

00:12:26.086 --> 00:12:29.406 A:middle
At this point you may think
they look very similar.

00:12:30.156 --> 00:12:33.356 A:middle
Why not have a base
Bot class providing all

00:12:33.356 --> 00:12:34.886 A:middle
of the functionality
to all three?

00:12:36.476 --> 00:12:38.266 A:middle
They're not actually
that similar after all.

00:12:39.176 --> 00:12:42.446 A:middle
The PlayerBot needs
input and we can control

00:12:42.446 --> 00:12:46.506 A:middle
that from a game controller or
keyboard or from touch control.

00:12:47.586 --> 00:12:49.186 A:middle
The GroundBot and
FlyingBot don't need that,

00:12:49.286 --> 00:12:50.656 A:middle
you never control
those characters.

00:12:51.096 --> 00:12:53.186 A:middle
They're driven instead
by an agent.

00:12:53.186 --> 00:12:55.526 A:middle
You will see later
how we use agents

00:12:55.526 --> 00:12:56.906 A:middle
to drive the characters
around the level.

00:12:57.736 --> 00:12:58.976 A:middle
Player Bot doesn't
need an agent,

00:12:59.186 --> 00:13:00.576 A:middle
he's powered by your input.



00:12:59.186 --> 00:13:00.576 A:middle
he's powered by your input.

00:13:01.866 --> 00:13:03.006 A:middle
Likewise, GroundBot

00:13:03.066 --> 00:13:05.816 A:middle
and FlyingBot have rules
telling the what they should do

00:13:05.816 --> 00:13:08.486 A:middle
in a given situation and we'll
look at those later on as well.

00:13:09.436 --> 00:13:13.046 A:middle
Player Bot doesn't, you
tell him what to do.

00:13:13.046 --> 00:13:15.876 A:middle
PlayerBot and GroundBot do
have one thing in common,

00:13:16.516 --> 00:13:18.586 A:middle
they both have a
movement component.

00:13:19.636 --> 00:13:22.746 A:middle
This component's job is to
say if I'm here and I need

00:13:22.746 --> 00:13:25.326 A:middle
to move this distance
at a certain angle make

00:13:25.326 --> 00:13:26.556 A:middle
that happen within the Scene.

00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:30.276 A:middle
Player Bot uses that
input to render it

00:13:30.276 --> 00:13:31.516 A:middle
in the Scene, move him around.

00:13:32.366 --> 00:13:35.036 A:middle
GroundBot uses it for a
charge forward attack,

00:13:35.036 --> 00:13:36.576 A:middle
he moves from here
to charge forward.

00:13:37.956 --> 00:13:39.566 A:middle
FlyingBot doesn't
need that capability.

00:13:39.766 --> 00:13:42.636 A:middle
He doesn't move so he
doesn't have that component.

00:13:43.746 --> 00:13:46.666 A:middle
These components, it is a
good way to break up bits

00:13:46.666 --> 00:13:48.716 A:middle
of functionality
and assign them only

00:13:48.716 --> 00:13:50.116 A:middle
to the entities that need them.

00:13:51.976 --> 00:13:54.506 A:middle
So these are some of the
ways we have used GameplayKit

00:13:54.506 --> 00:13:55.866 A:middle
functionality in the game.

00:13:55.866 --> 00:13:59.836 A:middle
I would like to invite Dave
on stage to tell you more

00:13:59.836 --> 00:14:01.126 A:middle
about how we have
used GameplayKit



00:13:59.836 --> 00:14:01.126 A:middle
about how we have
used GameplayKit

00:14:01.516 --> 00:14:04.566 A:middle
to create our games
Logic and Gameplay.

00:14:05.516 --> 00:14:09.306 A:middle
[Applause]

00:14:09.806 --> 00:14:10.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; DAVE SCHAEFGEN:
Thank you, Dave.

00:14:10.976 --> 00:14:14.016 A:middle
So when we think about
Logic in Gameplay,

00:14:14.336 --> 00:14:16.806 A:middle
one of the most immediate
things that jump to my mind

00:14:16.806 --> 00:14:17.566 A:middle
when I think about logic

00:14:17.566 --> 00:14:20.926 A:middle
in gameplay is the actual
intelligence of my adversaries.

00:14:22.326 --> 00:14:26.386 A:middle
a big piece of that
intelligence is going

00:14:26.386 --> 00:14:30.876 A:middle
to be what I can
actually do in that space?

00:14:31.876 --> 00:14:34.866 A:middle
As we saw earlier in the demo,
if I'm a good Bot I'm moving

00:14:34.866 --> 00:14:36.866 A:middle
around the level,
patrolling circuits,

00:14:36.906 --> 00:14:37.936 A:middle
keepings things moving.

00:14:38.986 --> 00:14:42.556 A:middle
If I'm bad, I may want
to attack the PlayerBot.

00:14:42.786 --> 00:14:45.096 A:middle
Got him that time.

00:14:46.766 --> 00:14:51.016 A:middle
I may also wasn't to turn other
TaskBots bad so I have help

00:14:51.636 --> 00:14:53.026 A:middle
when it comes to
getting the player Bot.

00:14:53.526 --> 00:14:54.296 A:middle
Got that one too.

00:14:55.816 --> 00:15:01.956 A:middle
Finally, I may move around the
level opposite direction messing



00:14:55.816 --> 00:15:01.956 A:middle
Finally, I may move around the
level opposite direction messing

00:15:01.956 --> 00:15:05.586 A:middle
with induction, currents in
the circuits, causing problems.

00:15:06.926 --> 00:15:09.056 A:middle
Not as interesting, but now

00:15:09.466 --> 00:15:13.986 A:middle
that we know what we can do
the question becomes how do we

00:15:13.986 --> 00:15:16.746 A:middle
decide what we are going to do.

00:15:17.826 --> 00:15:19.576 A:middle
In DemoBots we chose

00:15:19.576 --> 00:15:24.826 A:middle
to implement a fuzzy logic
system with GKRuleSystem.

00:15:25.026 --> 00:15:29.466 A:middle
The advantages of this were
we could still take in a lot

00:15:29.466 --> 00:15:31.556 A:middle
of information about the
current state of the level,

00:15:32.036 --> 00:15:35.686 A:middle
what was going on, and
have our characters react

00:15:35.686 --> 00:15:36.616 A:middle
to that information.

00:15:37.466 --> 00:15:41.076 A:middle
We could do that without
having if else trees that went

00:15:41.076 --> 00:15:42.946 A:middle
on for hundreds of
lines of code.

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:47.516 A:middle
We have simple rules and rely
on the simple rules to interact

00:15:47.516 --> 00:15:49.426 A:middle
with each other and
allow complex

00:15:49.426 --> 00:15:51.276 A:middle
and interesting behaviors
to emerge.

00:15:52.466 --> 00:15:57.496 A:middle
So if you're unfamiliar with
fuzzy Logic, I'll give you a bit

00:15:57.496 --> 00:15:59.716 A:middle
of an idea of what we're
talking about here.



00:16:00.246 --> 00:16:04.386 A:middle
The fuzzy that we're referring
to is actually the fact

00:16:04.386 --> 00:16:07.866 A:middle
that everything is not black
and white, true and false.

00:16:08.246 --> 00:16:10.346 A:middle
Our rules aren't
mutually exclusive.

00:16:11.016 --> 00:16:17.286 A:middle
We modeled our rules on natural
concepts and tried to think

00:16:17.286 --> 00:16:20.216 A:middle
of them like sentences that
you would say to a colleague.

00:16:20.766 --> 00:16:22.486 A:middle
The PlayerBot is nearby.

00:16:23.926 --> 00:16:28.176 A:middle
. These are implemented in
the fuzzy TaskBots rule class.

00:16:29.086 --> 00:16:30.696 A:middle
It is a subclass of GKRule.

00:16:30.696 --> 00:16:37.156 A:middle
We have actually tied the fact
of the rule to the grade here.

00:16:38.176 --> 00:16:41.266 A:middle
Only we assert the fact if the
grade is greater than zero.

00:16:42.886 --> 00:16:46.286 A:middle
This is interesting because
we made grade a function

00:16:46.286 --> 00:16:51.766 A:middle
of the actual state information
available in the level rather

00:16:51.766 --> 00:16:53.946 A:middle
than it being something that
you set up at the moment

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:56.866 A:middle
that you create the GKRule.

00:16:56.866 --> 00:17:04.396 A:middle
Let's look at what those -- what
that proximity rule looks like.



00:16:56.866 --> 00:17:04.396 A:middle
Let's look at what those -- what
that proximity rule looks like.

00:17:04.636 --> 00:17:07.836 A:middle
Thinking about being
near or far,

00:17:08.415 --> 00:17:11.526 A:middle
and let's actually use a
graph to take a look at this

00:17:11.665 --> 00:17:13.256 A:middle
and see how these
functions work.

00:17:14.006 --> 00:17:17.445 A:middle
Up here near the origin you can
see that we have a PlayerBot

00:17:18.016 --> 00:17:19.306 A:middle
and out about as far away

00:17:19.306 --> 00:17:21.215 A:middle
as we can get them
you have the TaskBot,

00:17:21.806 --> 00:17:24.516 A:middle
if I bring in a graphical
representation

00:17:24.646 --> 00:17:29.796 A:middle
of the far rule it is pretty
simple to see that the grade

00:17:29.836 --> 00:17:31.936 A:middle
for the far rule is going
to be one in this case.

00:17:32.486 --> 00:17:35.476 A:middle
If I pull in the
medium and near rules,

00:17:35.846 --> 00:17:37.266 A:middle
it is clear that they're going

00:17:37.266 --> 00:17:39.806 A:middle
to have a zero grade
in this situation.

00:17:40.486 --> 00:17:43.546 A:middle
Now that doesn't lineup
seeming all that interesting,

00:17:43.546 --> 00:17:47.606 A:middle
it does kindof seem black and
white and a bit true/false.

00:17:47.606 --> 00:17:54.466 A:middle
If we move our task Bot closer
you can see what I'm talking

00:17:54.466 --> 00:17:55.616 A:middle
about clearly.

00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:58.226 A:middle
Here the grade for
the far rule is.

00:17:58.226 --> 00:18:02.656 A:middle
75 and for the medium
rule, about.



00:17:58.226 --> 00:18:02.656 A:middle
75 and for the medium
rule, about.

00:18:02.656 --> 00:18:08.186 A:middle
25. If we move him still
closer, things switch

00:18:08.256 --> 00:18:11.476 A:middle
and we have membership in both
the near and medium rules.

00:18:11.476 --> 00:18:16.136 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Now that you have
seen how the functions

00:18:16.356 --> 00:18:18.696 A:middle
that we have calculate
our grades,

00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:24.496 A:middle
let's look at how we actually
make decisions once we have

00:18:24.496 --> 00:18:27.416 A:middle
calculated those grades
for each of our rules.

00:18:27.856 --> 00:18:30.886 A:middle
So here are the rules that
we actually have in DemoBots.

00:18:31.716 --> 00:18:34.826 A:middle
Our first step, like I
said, is to go ahead,

00:18:34.886 --> 00:18:36.996 A:middle
evaluate them, calculate
the values.

00:18:37.976 --> 00:18:41.936 A:middle
The next thing we're going to
do is combine a few of them

00:18:42.686 --> 00:18:48.246 A:middle
to decide these are contributing
factors that we would want

00:18:48.246 --> 00:18:50.996 A:middle
to pay attention to when
hunting the PlayerBot.

00:18:51.666 --> 00:18:54.836 A:middle
Read like a sentence, you
can tell how this is working

00:18:54.836 --> 00:18:56.556 A:middle
like a telling of a story.

00:18:57.496 --> 00:19:00.246 A:middle
If a percentage of
bad TaskBots is high



00:18:57.496 --> 00:19:00.246 A:middle
If a percentage of
bad TaskBots is high

00:19:00.866 --> 00:19:03.376 A:middle
and the PlayerBot is
a medium distance away

00:19:04.056 --> 00:19:07.616 A:middle
and the good TaskBot is
also a medium distance away,

00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:11.456 A:middle
I want to hunt the PlayerBot.

00:19:12.586 --> 00:19:14.726 A:middle
The reason I would want
to do that in this case,

00:19:14.916 --> 00:19:18.746 A:middle
the way I think about it,
is there already are a lot

00:19:18.746 --> 00:19:22.166 A:middle
of bad TaskBots on this level,
I don't need to turn them,

00:19:22.466 --> 00:19:24.086 A:middle
I may as well hunt the player

00:19:24.086 --> 00:19:30.306 A:middle
at this point.The trouble I have
is I have 3 different grades

00:19:30.686 --> 00:19:34.726 A:middle
to represent this idea of
hunting the PlayerBot now.

00:19:35.066 --> 00:19:39.176 A:middle
So we're going to use
GKRuleSystems minimum grade

00:19:39.176 --> 00:19:44.906 A:middle
for facts to grab the minimum
grade for each of the facts

00:19:44.906 --> 00:19:47.236 A:middle
that we want to combine.

00:19:47.356 --> 00:19:53.026 A:middle
Now, the reason why we pick
the minimum is our mandate

00:19:53.346 --> 00:19:56.596 A:middle
for hunting the PlayerBot based
on that information is only

00:19:56.596 --> 00:20:02.496 A:middle
as strong as the weakest
fact contributing to it.



00:19:56.596 --> 00:20:02.496 A:middle
as strong as the weakest
fact contributing to it.

00:20:02.666 --> 00:20:06.806 A:middle
We could combine those
rules in any number of ways

00:20:06.896 --> 00:20:10.866 A:middle
and get several different
indicators saying

00:20:10.866 --> 00:20:13.786 A:middle
to hunt the PlayerBot
or to hunt TaskBots.

00:20:14.826 --> 00:20:17.746 A:middle
This is the stage
where we get to needing

00:20:17.746 --> 00:20:22.886 A:middle
to actually defuzz-ify the
rules to get one simple number

00:20:23.286 --> 00:20:26.646 A:middle
to really represent the idea
of hunting the PlayerBot.

00:20:27.716 --> 00:20:30.126 A:middle
In this case we just
take our facts,

00:20:30.816 --> 00:20:32.806 A:middle
we use the reduce
function in Swift

00:20:33.006 --> 00:20:36.036 A:middle
and the max function
to combine things.

00:20:36.426 --> 00:20:40.436 A:middle
In this case we actually --
we want hunting the PlayerBot

00:20:40.436 --> 00:20:42.326 A:middle
or hunting the TaskBots
to be represented

00:20:42.326 --> 00:20:46.396 A:middle
by the strongest grade
available of the ones we have.

00:20:47.166 --> 00:20:48.276 A:middle
Looking at these numbers,

00:20:48.276 --> 00:20:50.866 A:middle
it is pretty obvious
we'll hunt the PlayerBot.

00:20:50.866 --> 00:21:02.896 A:middle
Now that we know we want to hunt
the PlayerBot the first problem



00:20:50.866 --> 00:21:02.896 A:middle
Now that we know we want to hunt
the PlayerBot the first problem

00:21:02.896 --> 00:21:07.756 A:middle
we've got is how do I
actually get to the PlayerBot.

00:21:08.216 --> 00:21:10.036 A:middle
Often that's pretty
straightforward,

00:21:11.196 --> 00:21:16.006 A:middle
just move in a straight line
and you'll eventually get there.

00:21:16.366 --> 00:21:18.596 A:middle
Obstacles present a challenge,

00:21:18.736 --> 00:21:21.816 A:middle
here you see the FlyingBot
getting hung up there.

00:21:21.946 --> 00:21:26.396 A:middle
You remember from a sample from
a couple years ago, Adventure,

00:21:26.766 --> 00:21:31.016 A:middle
the goblins in that sample, were
really fond of this behavior.

00:21:32.306 --> 00:21:34.956 A:middle
We decided to do
something about that,

00:21:34.956 --> 00:21:39.616 A:middle
and in GameplayKit we have
made it really easy for you

00:21:39.616 --> 00:21:43.906 A:middle
to take advantage of pathfinding
in a world and get your Bots

00:21:44.416 --> 00:21:47.296 A:middle
or your enemies moving
easily like this.

00:21:47.676 --> 00:21:50.496 A:middle
It has great conveniences
for working with things

00:21:50.616 --> 00:21:54.376 A:middle
when you're using SpriteKit for
a game and it is really easy

00:21:54.816 --> 00:21:56.166 A:middle
to get things up and running.

00:21:56.956 --> 00:21:58.826 A:middle
Only a few lines of code.

00:21:59.006 --> 00:22:02.146 A:middle
Let's take a look at what
those lines look like.



00:21:59.006 --> 00:22:02.146 A:middle
Let's take a look at what
those lines look like.

00:22:04.136 --> 00:22:05.516 A:middle
So the first thing you're going

00:22:05.516 --> 00:22:11.096 A:middle
to do is actually get the
polygon obstacles making

00:22:11.096 --> 00:22:11.796 A:middle
up the level.

00:22:12.106 --> 00:22:18.256 A:middle
In our case we'll first search
for our nodes within our Scene.

00:22:18.306 --> 00:22:20.086 A:middle
They have all been
named obstacles.

00:22:20.176 --> 00:22:23.236 A:middle
When we have an array of
those nodes we'll pass it

00:22:23.436 --> 00:22:27.336 A:middle
to a convenience function
that SKNodes has in iOS 9,

00:22:27.786 --> 00:22:29.516 A:middle
obstacles for node
physics bodies

00:22:30.416 --> 00:22:34.796 A:middle
to take the actual physics
body you defined to use

00:22:34.796 --> 00:22:37.156 A:middle
that to define the obstacle.

00:22:38.076 --> 00:22:42.016 A:middle
When those obstacles, when we
have the obstacles we're going

00:22:42.016 --> 00:22:45.396 A:middle
to construct an obstacle
graph using them,

00:22:45.856 --> 00:22:47.996 A:middle
and also a buffer
radius parameter.

00:22:48.596 --> 00:22:52.936 A:middle
This parameter is a
little bit of extra spacing

00:22:53.296 --> 00:22:55.166 A:middle
around the actual obstacle.

00:22:55.886 --> 00:22:58.286 A:middle
A good way for you to
think about it might be

00:22:58.866 --> 00:23:01.716 A:middle
as you're walking towards a
doorway and you're walking



00:22:58.866 --> 00:23:01.716 A:middle
as you're walking towards a
doorway and you're walking

00:23:01.716 --> 00:23:04.346 A:middle
through the doorway you're
not actually going to walk

00:23:04.346 --> 00:23:06.696 A:middle
at one corner or the
other of the door frame.

00:23:07.226 --> 00:23:10.166 A:middle
You're going to aim for a point
in the middle of the doorway

00:23:10.416 --> 00:23:12.086 A:middle
where no part of your
body is actually going

00:23:12.086 --> 00:23:14.496 A:middle
to contact the door when
you walk through it.

00:23:14.726 --> 00:23:19.466 A:middle
This radius helps set that
spacing around the obstacles.

00:23:20.266 --> 00:23:26.176 A:middle
Next we'll take the TaskBot
and PlayerBot positions

00:23:26.686 --> 00:23:28.236 A:middle
and connect them to the graph.

00:23:29.516 --> 00:23:35.146 A:middle
Finally we will ask the
graph to give us a path

00:23:35.886 --> 00:23:37.486 A:middle
from the start node
to the end node.

00:23:38.126 --> 00:23:40.896 A:middle
We'll get back in array
of the individual nodes

00:23:41.306 --> 00:23:44.646 A:middle
that are necessary to get
from point A to point B

00:23:45.396 --> 00:23:49.326 A:middle
and it really is that simple
to turn things from walking

00:23:49.326 --> 00:23:53.836 A:middle
into memory chips and along them
to actually walking around them.

00:23:55.126 --> 00:23:57.716 A:middle
We have a path, we have points,

00:23:58.066 --> 00:23:59.806 A:middle
but how am I actually
going to get there?



00:24:00.276 --> 00:24:03.096 A:middle
How do I actually get there
and make it look nice?

00:24:04.076 --> 00:24:07.976 A:middle
Well, GameplayKit has
an answer for us again.

00:24:07.976 --> 00:24:11.396 A:middle
This time it is GKAgent 2D.

00:24:11.676 --> 00:24:15.696 A:middle
This is one of my favorite
classes in GameplayKit.

00:24:16.576 --> 00:24:20.066 A:middle
This is a GKComponent,
so it works very nicely

00:24:20.066 --> 00:24:22.836 A:middle
with the Entity/Component system
that Dave talked about earlier.

00:24:24.326 --> 00:24:27.666 A:middle
It is very easy to
get things set up.

00:24:28.276 --> 00:24:30.676 A:middle
You have a GKBehavior
that describes what it is

00:24:30.676 --> 00:24:32.116 A:middle
that you want this agent to do,

00:24:32.246 --> 00:24:35.316 A:middle
it is kind of a container
for GKGoals.

00:24:35.986 --> 00:24:40.806 A:middle
GKGoal, lucky for us in this
case actually has a couple

00:24:40.806 --> 00:24:46.566 A:middle
of different constructions that
allow us to work with paths.

00:24:47.016 --> 00:24:49.006 A:middle
Because the agent
world and the world

00:24:49.006 --> 00:24:50.906 A:middle
of GameplayKit is
different from the world

00:24:50.906 --> 00:24:55.746 A:middle
of SpriteKit the delegate
here makes it very simple

00:24:56.036 --> 00:24:58.926 A:middle
to integrate the two of them.

00:24:59.206 --> 00:25:01.536 A:middle
Let's take a look at
what it actually --



00:24:59.206 --> 00:25:01.536 A:middle
Let's take a look at
what it actually --

00:25:01.536 --> 00:25:03.206 A:middle
you know, what the
code looks like.

00:25:04.286 --> 00:25:11.286 A:middle
We'll take that array of path
nodes that we had from before.

00:25:11.286 --> 00:25:13.046 A:middle
We're going to initialize them.

00:25:13.046 --> 00:25:19.006 A:middle
We're going to pass them to an
initializer to create our path.

00:25:19.866 --> 00:25:22.836 A:middle
There is another parameter
here and that is the radius.

00:25:22.836 --> 00:25:23.556 A:middle
What I want you to think

00:25:23.556 --> 00:25:26.946 A:middle
about here is how do
you want this path

00:25:26.976 --> 00:25:28.546 A:middle
to be defined for your agent.

00:25:28.906 --> 00:25:30.716 A:middle
Very small values will result

00:25:30.716 --> 00:25:33.356 A:middle
in your agent treating your
path like a tight rope.

00:25:34.096 --> 00:25:38.036 A:middle
Larger values, you know,
could have them treating it

00:25:38.036 --> 00:25:40.776 A:middle
like an 8-lane highway,
moving all over the place.

00:25:41.276 --> 00:25:42.516 A:middle
You'll want to fine tune

00:25:42.516 --> 00:25:44.396 A:middle
that for what works
best for your game.

00:25:46.376 --> 00:25:47.966 A:middle
Next we'll create a behavior.

00:25:48.546 --> 00:25:50.346 A:middle
Here it is just an
empty behavior,

00:25:50.346 --> 00:25:53.066 A:middle
nothing really going on yet.

00:25:53.066 --> 00:25:55.956 A:middle
Then we'll add goals to it.

00:25:55.956 --> 00:25:58.276 A:middle
These are the two
path-related goals I was talking

00:25:58.276 --> 00:25:59.076 A:middle
about from before.

00:25:59.716 --> 00:26:05.546 A:middle
The first one on the screen,
our goal to follow path is going



00:25:59.716 --> 00:26:05.546 A:middle
The first one on the screen,
our goal to follow path is going

00:26:05.546 --> 00:26:09.136 A:middle
to establish the direction in
which we'll travel our array.

00:26:09.526 --> 00:26:11.566 A:middle
In this case we'll move
forward in a forward direction

00:26:11.726 --> 00:26:16.006 A:middle
from the start position, our
TaskBots to the end position,

00:26:16.166 --> 00:26:17.086 A:middle
which was our PlayerBot.

00:26:18.106 --> 00:26:23.646 A:middle
The stay on path goal is
there to motivate our agent,

00:26:23.976 --> 00:26:28.866 A:middle
to actually remain within
the bounds of the path

00:26:29.146 --> 00:26:30.626 A:middle
that we defined earlier.

00:26:31.186 --> 00:26:35.756 A:middle
Now that we have a working
behavior we assign it

00:26:35.756 --> 00:26:39.366 A:middle
to our agent to get him moving.

00:26:39.726 --> 00:26:43.946 A:middle
the agent works like many

00:26:43.946 --> 00:26:46.716 A:middle
of the other components
within GameplayKit.

00:26:46.716 --> 00:26:48.756 A:middle
It is updated on a cycle.

00:26:49.416 --> 00:26:55.756 A:middle
When you've added it into your
update loop it will notify you

00:26:55.756 --> 00:26:57.816 A:middle
before and after changes,

00:26:57.866 --> 00:27:00.216 A:middle
and this delegate
notification before



00:26:57.866 --> 00:27:00.216 A:middle
and this delegate
notification before

00:27:00.216 --> 00:27:02.226 A:middle
and after changes
is the ideal place

00:27:02.226 --> 00:27:07.406 A:middle
to actually get things working
and hooked up with SpriteKit.

00:27:07.876 --> 00:27:12.306 A:middle
In WillUpdate, this is
a position that you want

00:27:12.306 --> 00:27:17.556 A:middle
to take the information
from your SpriteKit node

00:27:17.726 --> 00:27:21.326 A:middle
that represents your
agent in Scene and pull

00:27:21.326 --> 00:27:24.296 A:middle
that information back
over and update the agent

00:27:25.266 --> 00:27:27.496 A:middle
because we're doing
this at the front

00:27:28.226 --> 00:27:31.546 A:middle
of the SpriteKit
update loop and the end

00:27:31.906 --> 00:27:34.786 A:middle
of the last SpriteKit update
loop would have involved

00:27:35.026 --> 00:27:38.626 A:middle
simulating physics, applying
constraints to your node

00:27:38.866 --> 00:27:40.866 A:middle
which may have caused
its position to move

00:27:40.966 --> 00:27:44.056 A:middle
from where the agent thought it
was at the last time through.

00:27:44.676 --> 00:27:50.306 A:middle
In AgentDidUpdate, we'll take
the information from the agent,

00:27:51.296 --> 00:27:54.146 A:middle
its position, its rotation,
things of that nature

00:27:54.996 --> 00:27:58.636 A:middle
and pull those back over into
the SpriteKit world updating our

00:27:58.636 --> 00:28:01.946 A:middle
node before it goes
into physics simulation



00:27:58.636 --> 00:28:01.946 A:middle
node before it goes
into physics simulation

00:28:02.336 --> 00:28:08.036 A:middle
and constraint application
this time around.

00:28:08.036 --> 00:28:14.396 A:middle
Really, that is what got us
to this point with DemoBots

00:28:15.116 --> 00:28:18.256 A:middle
and an intelligence that
works nicely, moving readily

00:28:18.256 --> 00:28:23.746 A:middle
around the screen, smoothly
interacting with you.

00:28:23.746 --> 00:28:27.256 A:middle
This is something extra I
guess, we left debug drawing

00:28:27.956 --> 00:28:30.196 A:middle
in the sample that
you can download.

00:28:30.996 --> 00:28:33.936 A:middle
You can enable it by
hitting the slash key.

00:28:35.076 --> 00:28:38.466 A:middle
The nice thing about this,
it helps you visualize some

00:28:38.466 --> 00:28:40.066 A:middle
of the parameters we
talked about earlier.

00:28:40.406 --> 00:28:44.896 A:middle
The orange boxes are buffer
radius around the obstacles

00:28:46.386 --> 00:28:51.786 A:middle
and the thick lines that you can
see emanating from the player,

00:28:51.786 --> 00:28:56.616 A:middle
the task Bots are a
representation of that path

00:28:57.536 --> 00:29:01.506 A:middle
that we talked about, the
path radius that was there.



00:28:57.536 --> 00:29:01.506 A:middle
that we talked about, the
path radius that was there.

00:29:01.506 --> 00:29:04.326 A:middle
Now that we have a game, I would

00:29:04.326 --> 00:29:07.056 A:middle
like to invite my colleague
Michael up on stage.

00:29:07.426 --> 00:29:09.506 A:middle
He's going to discuss
with you how

00:29:09.506 --> 00:29:12.466 A:middle
to get your users playing
your game that much faster.

00:29:13.086 --> 00:29:13.346 A:middle
Michael.

00:29:14.516 --> 00:29:18.846 A:middle
[Applause]

00:29:19.346 --> 00:29:20.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL DEWITT:
Thank you very much.

00:29:20.056 --> 00:29:23.826 A:middle
We'll talk about
taking a fun game

00:29:23.826 --> 00:29:27.336 A:middle
and making a great overall
experience for your users.

00:29:27.336 --> 00:29:29.896 A:middle
I'll boil it down to
one phrase and that is,

00:29:29.896 --> 00:29:31.466 A:middle
of course, time to fun.

00:29:31.846 --> 00:29:33.836 A:middle
How long does it
take for your users

00:29:33.836 --> 00:29:35.456 A:middle
to start really enjoying
your game?

00:29:36.386 --> 00:29:39.566 A:middle
The first barrier to entry there
is really the initial download.

00:29:40.026 --> 00:29:44.036 A:middle
If you're shipping an app that's
too big some users won't be able

00:29:44.036 --> 00:29:45.746 A:middle
to download it over
cellular connection

00:29:46.096 --> 00:29:47.796 A:middle
and it can take a
while even on Wi-Fi.

00:29:48.646 --> 00:29:50.616 A:middle
This is the biggest latency

00:29:50.926 --> 00:29:53.256 A:middle
between your user finding
the app on the App Store

00:29:53.346 --> 00:29:56.426 A:middle
and deciding to get into it.

00:29:56.426 --> 00:30:00.056 A:middle
But we know this 100 mega
download limit is hard



00:29:56.426 --> 00:30:00.056 A:middle
But we know this 100 mega
download limit is hard

00:30:00.056 --> 00:30:01.356 A:middle
for games to stay under.

00:30:01.736 --> 00:30:03.906 A:middle
We'll go back to DemoBots
and see how we handle this.

00:30:04.486 --> 00:30:09.126 A:middle
If you focus on the PlayerBot
you notice we're not looking

00:30:09.126 --> 00:30:10.776 A:middle
strictly top-down
on the character.

00:30:11.386 --> 00:30:14.276 A:middle
It is not a 2D game but
an isometric feel here.

00:30:14.936 --> 00:30:17.406 A:middle
We pulled that off by
giving this character

00:30:17.406 --> 00:30:18.836 A:middle
multiple orientations.

00:30:19.566 --> 00:30:22.256 A:middle
As you move the character
around the map,

00:30:22.786 --> 00:30:25.486 A:middle
we'll swap out the texture
representing the character

00:30:25.716 --> 00:30:27.426 A:middle
to get this perspective.

00:30:28.316 --> 00:30:32.446 A:middle
When you add all of the extra
frames in there, it takes space.

00:30:32.506 --> 00:30:34.976 A:middle
It is only 6 megabytes,
that's small for a game.

00:30:34.976 --> 00:30:38.146 A:middle
When you consider it is 6
megabytes times the three bots

00:30:38.146 --> 00:30:41.586 A:middle
we have times the different
actions they can perform,

00:30:41.886 --> 00:30:45.476 A:middle
we need the orientation frames
for the Player Bot when idling,

00:30:45.476 --> 00:30:50.216 A:middle
hit, walking around, so
this starts to add up.

00:30:50.436 --> 00:30:54.226 A:middle
Traditionally, that means that
all of the assets plus the 1X,

00:30:54.226 --> 00:30:58.136 A:middle
2X, 3X versions, they're
bundled in the app.

00:30:58.386 --> 00:31:00.306 A:middle
We have a better
story for this now.



00:30:58.386 --> 00:31:00.306 A:middle
We have a better
story for this now.

00:31:00.686 --> 00:31:02.196 A:middle
You may have heard about
it earlier this week.

00:31:02.746 --> 00:31:06.456 A:middle
If you use asset catalogs
you will take advantage

00:31:06.456 --> 00:31:07.916 A:middle
of a new feature
called app slicing.

00:31:08.386 --> 00:31:12.296 A:middle
What app slicing will do
is breakdown the 1X, 2X,

00:31:12.336 --> 00:31:16.486 A:middle
3X for the actual device
that they're used on.

00:31:17.226 --> 00:31:20.436 A:middle
This is going to save us a ton
of space right off the bat just

00:31:20.436 --> 00:31:21.896 A:middle
by using the asset catalogs

00:31:21.946 --> 00:31:24.076 A:middle
and letting the App
Store slice it for us.

00:31:24.296 --> 00:31:26.776 A:middle
It is not only that we
now save a bunch of space,

00:31:26.776 --> 00:31:29.006 A:middle
it is what can we do with
the extra room on our app.

00:31:29.006 --> 00:31:30.926 A:middle
I'm looking at the
graph and it is empty.

00:31:31.446 --> 00:31:34.966 A:middle
In DemoBots, it has
practical implications.

00:31:36.586 --> 00:31:40.306 A:middle
We started with 8 orientations
and I'll show you a video here.

00:31:40.306 --> 00:31:41.156 A:middle
Watch closely.

00:31:41.156 --> 00:31:44.096 A:middle
The PlayerBot, it looks like
it is facing directly forward,

00:31:44.096 --> 00:31:46.646 A:middle
you will notice, watch
the movement closely,

00:31:46.646 --> 00:31:58.696 A:middle
see if you notice something.

00:31:58.796 --> 00:32:01.526 A:middle
So especially when the character
is moving back towards the top



00:31:58.796 --> 00:32:01.526 A:middle
So especially when the character
is moving back towards the top

00:32:01.526 --> 00:32:04.596 A:middle
of the map there, we
term that skating.

00:32:05.026 --> 00:32:07.096 A:middle
While we only have
the eight orientations

00:32:07.096 --> 00:32:08.866 A:middle
to represent the
characters movement,

00:32:09.016 --> 00:32:13.236 A:middle
the player is supplying 360°
of input, we can be slightly off

00:32:13.306 --> 00:32:17.256 A:middle
of that orientation while
not triggering the next

00:32:17.256 --> 00:32:19.136 A:middle
and you get the strafing
behavior.

00:32:19.976 --> 00:32:24.146 A:middle
More frustrating than that
though was using the eight

00:32:24.146 --> 00:32:27.176 A:middle
orientations means you could
end up in a situation like this

00:32:27.336 --> 00:32:29.496 A:middle
where the PlayerBot is
facing directly forward,

00:32:29.706 --> 00:32:33.076 A:middle
looks like it should be easily
hitting that TaskBot but isn't

00:32:33.076 --> 00:32:36.516 A:middle
because of the debug drawing,
you see the player is aiming

00:32:36.596 --> 00:32:39.546 A:middle
to the side and the user
has no way to see this.

00:32:40.236 --> 00:32:42.026 A:middle
With that extra space we got

00:32:42.026 --> 00:32:43.736 A:middle
from app slicing we
bumped it up a notch.

00:32:44.196 --> 00:32:46.016 A:middle
We went to 16 orientations,

00:32:46.496 --> 00:32:49.616 A:middle
that makes movement feel a lot
smoother throughout the game

00:32:50.636 --> 00:32:53.776 A:middle
so you can see we have many
more animation frames here

00:32:53.776 --> 00:32:55.146 A:middle
to represent that.

00:32:56.456 --> 00:33:00.186 A:middle
Then when it comes to aiming,
now it is much more granular.



00:32:56.456 --> 00:33:00.186 A:middle
Then when it comes to aiming,
now it is much more granular.

00:33:00.396 --> 00:33:02.766 A:middle
The direction where the
character faces almost

00:33:02.766 --> 00:33:05.036 A:middle
corresponds exactly with
where the beam's going to hit.

00:33:05.036 --> 00:33:09.786 A:middle
You click through there,
it is easier for the user

00:33:09.786 --> 00:33:12.526 A:middle
to know what's going
on with the game.

00:33:12.716 --> 00:33:15.556 A:middle
That's app slicing, we use
that in DemoBots simply

00:33:15.556 --> 00:33:18.246 A:middle
by putting our texture
atlases within Asset Catalogs,

00:33:18.636 --> 00:33:21.566 A:middle
it helps us to greatly decrease
the size of the app overall,

00:33:21.566 --> 00:33:23.146 A:middle
but it's more than that,

00:33:23.216 --> 00:33:25.436 A:middle
we can actually improve
the gameplay now

00:33:25.436 --> 00:33:28.276 A:middle
because we have the extra space.

00:33:28.276 --> 00:33:30.826 A:middle
This feature works super
well for assets that you need

00:33:30.826 --> 00:33:32.606 A:middle
in your game all the time.

00:33:32.666 --> 00:33:34.786 A:middle
DemoBots is not much of
a game unless we keep the

00:33:34.786 --> 00:33:35.746 A:middle
PlayerBot around.

00:33:36.686 --> 00:33:39.926 A:middle
But there are other assets
we don't necessarily need all

00:33:39.926 --> 00:33:40.426 A:middle
the time.

00:33:40.516 --> 00:33:42.636 A:middle
For that we have
another technology

00:33:42.636 --> 00:33:43.246 A:middle
that you may have heard

00:33:43.246 --> 00:33:45.746 A:middle
about earlier this week,
on demand resources.

00:33:46.176 --> 00:33:49.376 A:middle
The mild overview of this, it
lets you tag resources just

00:33:49.376 --> 00:33:51.516 A:middle
with a simple string
for download later on.

00:33:51.516 --> 00:33:54.116 A:middle
I'll talk about how we
use this in DemoBots.

00:33:54.556 --> 00:33:56.236 A:middle
The first place,
maybe it is obvious,

00:33:56.236 --> 00:33:59.396 A:middle
we have multiple levels.We
can tag those level 1,

00:33:59.396 --> 00:34:00.696 A:middle
level 2, and level 3 .



00:33:59.396 --> 00:34:00.696 A:middle
level 2, and level 3 .

00:34:01.236 --> 00:34:04.536 A:middle
The advantage here, it is
now that we have tagged these

00:34:04.536 --> 00:34:06.936 A:middle
with ODR we can actually say

00:34:06.936 --> 00:34:09.966 A:middle
if the user initially downloads
the game, we know they'll go

00:34:09.966 --> 00:34:11.996 A:middle
to level 1, there is no reason

00:34:11.996 --> 00:34:13.585 A:middle
to include the other
two levels there.

00:34:14.826 --> 00:34:18.156 A:middle
It gets even more interesting
as the game progresses,

00:34:18.696 --> 00:34:21.726 A:middle
because we can predict
with this linear flow

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:24.076 A:middle
that the user will
proceed on to level 3

00:34:24.426 --> 00:34:28.196 A:middle
so we'll start downloading that
level early and it is unlikely

00:34:28.196 --> 00:34:30.106 A:middle
that they'll replay level 1

00:34:30.466 --> 00:34:32.545 A:middle
to we can recycle some
of those resources.

00:34:32.946 --> 00:34:35.676 A:middle
Let's take it a step further.

00:34:36.315 --> 00:34:40.176 A:middle
If we look closely at
level 2 and you will notice

00:34:40.176 --> 00:34:42.335 A:middle
from the demo and from
this small picture

00:34:42.335 --> 00:34:44.896 A:middle
that only the FlyingBot
shows up in this level

00:34:45.045 --> 00:34:46.556 A:middle
and shows up again in level 3.

00:34:47.275 --> 00:34:51.416 A:middle
Contrast that with a GroundBot
who is in levels 1 and 3.

00:34:52.726 --> 00:34:55.536 A:middle
When we tag the characters
individually it allows us

00:34:55.536 --> 00:34:57.636 A:middle
to breakdown our
resources even further.

00:34:57.756 --> 00:34:59.616 A:middle
If we know the user
is downloading the app

00:34:59.616 --> 00:35:02.816 A:middle
for the first time we only ship
with the GroundBot in level 1



00:34:59.616 --> 00:35:02.816 A:middle
for the first time we only ship
with the GroundBot in level 1

00:35:02.996 --> 00:35:04.876 A:middle
and we can do the
FlyingBot later on.

00:35:05.606 --> 00:35:07.586 A:middle
And if you're on a device
that's tight for storage,

00:35:07.586 --> 00:35:10.206 A:middle
maybe when the user's playing
level 2 you can purge the

00:35:10.206 --> 00:35:13.166 A:middle
GroundBot and then bring
them both back for level 3.

00:35:14.036 --> 00:35:16.116 A:middle
You can see how we
laid out the tags

00:35:16.456 --> 00:35:19.466 A:middle
in the Project Navigator
under resource tags.

00:35:20.296 --> 00:35:22.996 A:middle
You will see that the assets
for level 1 are tagged

00:35:22.996 --> 00:35:25.756 A:middle
as prefetched, those
are coming down shortly

00:35:25.756 --> 00:35:28.616 A:middle
after the app has been
installed, but not included

00:35:28.616 --> 00:35:31.826 A:middle
in the bundle size, whereas the
other resources can be tagged

00:35:31.826 --> 00:35:33.356 A:middle
for download when
we request them.

00:35:34.636 --> 00:35:36.606 A:middle
That's on-demand resources.

00:35:36.836 --> 00:35:40.626 A:middle
We used it in DemoBots to tag
the resources for later download

00:35:40.726 --> 00:35:43.156 A:middle
which gives us a faster
initial download time.

00:35:43.156 --> 00:35:45.606 A:middle
We can cut a bunch of stuff out
that we don't need immediately.

00:35:46.186 --> 00:35:49.096 A:middle
Overall it helps us keep the
storage footprint small too.

00:35:49.356 --> 00:35:50.676 A:middle
That's the bigger message here.

00:35:50.676 --> 00:35:54.536 A:middle
You can make a more rich game
and have many more assets

00:35:54.856 --> 00:35:57.276 A:middle
because you are still keeping
the same footprint on device

00:35:57.496 --> 00:36:01.436 A:middle
but accessing everything
else on demand.



00:35:57.496 --> 00:36:01.436 A:middle
but accessing everything
else on demand.

00:36:01.706 --> 00:36:04.186 A:middle
We recognize this
does add complication.

00:36:05.006 --> 00:36:09.066 A:middle
When you talk about presenting
the next Scene traditionally you

00:36:09.066 --> 00:36:12.316 A:middle
know it is in local storage,
you can prepare those resources,

00:36:12.316 --> 00:36:14.246 A:middle
and when the user requests
it, you can present.

00:36:15.326 --> 00:36:17.236 A:middle
Now we're adding an
extra complication.

00:36:17.236 --> 00:36:20.556 A:middle
Maybe you need to download
those resources, and of course

00:36:20.556 --> 00:36:23.446 A:middle
with network connection
that download can fail.

00:36:24.556 --> 00:36:26.496 A:middle
If you want to get the
space savings, you will have

00:36:26.496 --> 00:36:29.606 A:middle
to purge the resources
at some point and rinse

00:36:29.606 --> 00:36:30.676 A:middle
and repeat that whole cycle.

00:36:31.566 --> 00:36:35.166 A:middle
This can get complicated
and I want to focus

00:36:35.166 --> 00:36:36.726 A:middle
on how we solved it in DemoBots.

00:36:37.156 --> 00:36:39.916 A:middle
Specifically going back to a
technology that Dave mentioned

00:36:39.916 --> 00:36:42.176 A:middle
at the top of the talk,
the GKStateMachine.

00:36:42.966 --> 00:36:46.906 A:middle
If we use that to model this,
we call it our SceneLoader

00:36:46.906 --> 00:36:48.856 A:middle
and it has six associated
states.

00:36:49.516 --> 00:36:51.116 A:middle
You will notice that
only two of the states,

00:36:51.116 --> 00:36:53.436 A:middle
the downloading resources
and download failed state,

00:36:53.436 --> 00:36:55.116 A:middle
they're actually
associated with ODR

00:36:55.206 --> 00:36:58.126 A:middle
because this is a full pipeline
to model bringing your resources

00:36:58.126 --> 00:37:00.976 A:middle
into memory whether they're
from local storage or need



00:36:58.126 --> 00:37:00.976 A:middle
into memory whether they're
from local storage or need

00:37:00.976 --> 00:37:02.156 A:middle
to be downloaded first.

00:37:02.926 --> 00:37:04.486 A:middle
the real advantage we're getting

00:37:04.486 --> 00:37:07.576 A:middle
from using the state machine
is how we model the transition

00:37:07.576 --> 00:37:08.436 A:middle
from states.

00:37:08.646 --> 00:37:09.646 A:middle
If we look closely

00:37:09.646 --> 00:37:14.646 A:middle
at the preparing resources state
we can enforce what are the

00:37:14.646 --> 00:37:18.276 A:middle
valid next states by
overriding IsValidNextState

00:37:18.276 --> 00:37:20.316 A:middle
in our GKState subclass

00:37:21.186 --> 00:37:24.226 A:middle
and we can say the state
machine can only move

00:37:24.226 --> 00:37:27.416 A:middle
on to the ready state if
the Scene is indeed loaded,

00:37:28.266 --> 00:37:30.296 A:middle
or we can move back
to the available state

00:37:30.296 --> 00:37:32.036 A:middle
if the user's canceled
this request.

00:37:32.336 --> 00:37:34.466 A:middle
We're not going to go back
to downloading while trying

00:37:34.466 --> 00:37:37.356 A:middle
to prepare our resources
because we're able to enforce it

00:37:37.356 --> 00:37:39.406 A:middle
with this IsValidNextState
and so it leads

00:37:39.406 --> 00:37:41.086 A:middle
to much more determininistic
behavior.

00:37:42.716 --> 00:37:44.256 A:middle
Alright, so to wrap things up,

00:37:44.256 --> 00:37:48.316 A:middle
I'll share a final few tips we
learned developing this game.

00:37:48.876 --> 00:37:51.196 A:middle
the first, if you're
using on-demand resources,

00:37:51.196 --> 00:37:53.296 A:middle
put that download
request in early.

00:37:53.636 --> 00:37:56.396 A:middle
If you have a predictable
progression in the game,

00:37:56.626 --> 00:37:58.456 A:middle
you can start downloading
level 2 as soon

00:37:58.456 --> 00:38:01.036 A:middle
as the player begins level 1.



00:37:58.456 --> 00:38:01.036 A:middle
as the player begins level 1.

00:38:02.516 --> 00:38:06.196 A:middle
Don't forget about the tools
for ODR that are within Xcode.

00:38:06.506 --> 00:38:09.826 A:middle
You can look at the disk
report tool and specifically

00:38:09.826 --> 00:38:11.296 A:middle
under the on-demand
resources see

00:38:11.296 --> 00:38:14.186 A:middle
if your tags have been
downloaded or are currently

00:38:14.186 --> 00:38:16.206 A:middle
in use or have already
been purged.

00:38:16.206 --> 00:38:17.086 A:middle
This is really useful.

00:38:18.896 --> 00:38:21.856 A:middle
Additionally, if the player
is coming up to a junction

00:38:22.406 --> 00:38:24.446 A:middle
when they'll need
additional resources

00:38:24.446 --> 00:38:26.346 A:middle
and you haven't downloaded
to prepare them yet.

00:38:26.616 --> 00:38:28.736 A:middle
You can modify the
priority of your request.

00:38:29.446 --> 00:38:31.606 A:middle
This means that you can
bump up the loading priority

00:38:31.606 --> 00:38:35.346 A:middle
on the bundle resource request,
it is a scale between 0 and 1

00:38:35.346 --> 00:38:38.476 A:middle
and there is even a constant for
urgent if the user is blocked

00:38:38.476 --> 00:38:39.626 A:middle
and you're trying to download.

00:38:40.246 --> 00:38:44.076 A:middle
We modeled preparing with an
NSOperation queue you can bump

00:38:44.076 --> 00:38:48.116 A:middle
up quality of service there.

00:38:48.366 --> 00:38:51.986 A:middle
Overall in DemoBots we
wanted to do a ton of things,

00:38:51.986 --> 00:38:55.276 A:middle
we really wanted to ship a
sample that showcased a bunch

00:38:55.276 --> 00:38:57.296 A:middle
of different aspects
of developing games

00:38:57.296 --> 00:38:58.906 A:middle
that we thought you would
all be interested in.

00:38:59.316 --> 00:39:02.946 A:middle
So Dave spoke to you initially
about fine tuning your assets



00:38:59.316 --> 00:39:02.946 A:middle
So Dave spoke to you initially
about fine tuning your assets

00:39:02.946 --> 00:39:06.696 A:middle
for every device, including
special assets for the Mac.

00:39:06.696 --> 00:39:08.576 A:middle
We talked about elegant
character navigation,

00:39:08.576 --> 00:39:10.796 A:middle
without having to write a
ton of movement code yourself

00:39:11.236 --> 00:39:14.976 A:middle
and finally adding additional
assets to improve gameplay

00:39:14.976 --> 00:39:17.776 A:middle
because now we're
slimming down our app.

00:39:17.776 --> 00:39:21.156 A:middle
I'm excited to say GamePlayKit
has ton of great features

00:39:21.156 --> 00:39:23.626 A:middle
and iOS 9 in general to
help you do these things.

00:39:24.526 --> 00:39:25.686 A:middle
To check out how they're used,

00:39:26.046 --> 00:39:29.856 A:middle
you can download the sample
right now from this link,

00:39:29.856 --> 00:39:31.336 A:middle
I encourage you to do so.

00:39:32.676 --> 00:39:35.666 A:middle
Here are additional
links for documentation,

00:39:35.666 --> 00:39:37.476 A:middle
you can contact our
evangelist Allan.

00:39:38.076 --> 00:39:42.076 A:middle
The related sessions we
mentioned throughout this talk,

00:39:42.076 --> 00:39:44.856 A:middle
they have already happened,
you can catch them online.

00:39:46.876 --> 00:39:47.666 A:middle
Thank you all so much.

00:39:48.516 --> 00:39:51.500 A:middle
[Applause]
