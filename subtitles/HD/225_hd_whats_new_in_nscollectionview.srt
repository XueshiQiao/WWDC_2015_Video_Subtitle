00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:21.196 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TROY STEPHENS:
Thank you for coming.

00:00:22.396 --> 00:00:26.596 A:middle
Welcome to Session 225, What's
New in NSCollectionView.

00:00:27.096 --> 00:00:29.296 A:middle
My name's Troy Stephens,
I'm a Software Engineer

00:00:29.346 --> 00:00:32.116 A:middle
on the AppKit team and
I'm delighted to get

00:00:32.116 --> 00:00:35.626 A:middle
to answer this question for
you today, what's new indeed.

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:36.886 A:middle
Let's find out.

00:00:38.226 --> 00:00:42.316 A:middle
NSCollectionView has been around
for a while on OS X since 10.5,

00:00:42.316 --> 00:00:46.156 A:middle
and it provides a handy way
to display a grid of items

00:00:46.156 --> 00:00:48.056 A:middle
in the user interface,
for example here,

00:00:48.346 --> 00:00:51.666 A:middle
in the Screen Saver Pref
panel, we have a grid

00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.226 A:middle
of items representing
the different screen

00:00:53.226 --> 00:00:54.046 A:middle
savers available.

00:00:54.356 --> 00:00:56.286 A:middle
CollectionView is good at
this, displaying a grid

00:00:56.286 --> 00:00:57.766 A:middle
of identically sized items,

00:00:58.076 --> 00:01:01.336 A:middle
you give CollectionView an
item prototype, which consists



00:00:58.076 --> 00:01:01.336 A:middle
you give CollectionView an
item prototype, which consists

00:01:01.406 --> 00:01:04.025 A:middle
of basically, a view
subtree of your own design,

00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:06.506 A:middle
and an associated
ViewController that manages it.

00:01:07.056 --> 00:01:12.166 A:middle
CollectionViewclones that item
prototype, to populate itself

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.836 A:middle
with items that represent
your model objects.

00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:18.826 A:middle
CollectionView supports
selection, drag and drop,

00:01:18.826 --> 00:01:20.286 A:middle
animated re-layout, all around,

00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:21.936 A:middle
it is a very handy
class to have around.

00:01:22.846 --> 00:01:25.106 A:middle
Now enter UICollectionView
on iOS,

00:01:25.676 --> 00:01:29.156 A:middle
a cousin to NSCollectionView
that is also very versatile.

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:31.926 A:middle
We see it here in
the World Clocks part

00:01:31.926 --> 00:01:34.506 A:middle
of the iPad Clocks app.

00:01:37.056 --> 00:01:39.336 A:middle
UI CollectionView,
like its name implies,

00:01:39.336 --> 00:01:41.646 A:middle
is useful for displaying
collections of items,

00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:44.186 A:middle
where each item, once
again, is represented

00:01:44.186 --> 00:01:46.856 A:middle
by a view subtree that's
completely of your own design,

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:49.386 A:middle
usually, these are loaded from
a nib, withUICollectionView.

00:01:50.646 --> 00:01:53.306 A:middle
And UICollectionView
supports mixing item types,

00:01:53.306 --> 00:01:55.866 A:middle
you can have different nibs,
prototypes for different items,

00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:57.106 A:middle
you're not stuck with just one.

00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:01.846 A:middle
UICollectionView supports
optional header views,



00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:01.846 A:middle
UICollectionView supports
optional header views,

00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:04.596 A:middle
and footer views surrounding
your items, and bracketing them.

00:02:05.156 --> 00:02:07.566 A:middle
This is especially useful
when used in conjunction

00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:10.586 A:middle
with the ability to group your
items into sections if you wish.

00:02:10.586 --> 00:02:13.176 A:middle
Each section can have a
header, and a footer view.

00:02:15.326 --> 00:02:18.246 A:middle
Layout is very flexible
and customizable,

00:02:18.246 --> 00:02:21.286 A:middle
there is a default flow
layout that handles about 90%

00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:22.986 A:middle
of your needs and is
very customizable,

00:02:22.986 --> 00:02:26.376 A:middle
you can tune its parameters to
usually get something close,

00:02:26.376 --> 00:02:27.396 A:middle
at least, to what you want.

00:02:28.296 --> 00:02:31.336 A:middle
UICollectionView is
also open to arbitrary,

00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:33.116 A:middle
developer-definable layouts.

00:02:33.156 --> 00:02:35.166 A:middle
Any kind of layout algorithm
that you can implement,

00:02:35.386 --> 00:02:36.866 A:middle
UICollectionView can use,

00:02:36.866 --> 00:02:38.886 A:middle
to apply to the items
that it shows.

00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:43.066 A:middle
Importantly, UICollectionView
is scalable.

00:02:43.506 --> 00:02:46.086 A:middle
It has smart behaviors in
it, so that it can scale

00:02:46.086 --> 00:02:49.166 A:middle
to potentially large numbers
of items, and it is smart

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:52.716 A:middle
about just instantiating the
items for model objects in view,

00:02:52.996 --> 00:02:55.906 A:middle
and recycling or reusing items
that have scrolled out of view

00:02:55.906 --> 00:02:57.386 A:middle
to represent other model objects

00:02:57.386 --> 00:02:58.696 A:middle
that have been scrolled
into view.

00:02:58.736 --> 00:02:59.556 A:middle
That's very handy.



00:03:01.446 --> 00:03:04.946 A:middle
Like everything else on iOS,
UICollectionView was designed

00:03:04.946 --> 00:03:06.976 A:middle
from the beginning to
always operate layer-backed,

00:03:07.346 --> 00:03:09.516 A:middle
which gives it the ability
to present very fluid,

00:03:09.516 --> 00:03:11.536 A:middle
high-frame-rate animation,
as the items

00:03:11.536 --> 00:03:14.006 A:middle
in the Collection View move
around, and come and go,

00:03:14.176 --> 00:03:16.166 A:middle
it can give you have a
very nice, animated effect.

00:03:16.966 --> 00:03:18.746 A:middle
With all of these
great features,

00:03:19.136 --> 00:03:22.206 A:middle
and an API that developers have
already become familiar with,

00:03:22.696 --> 00:03:26.266 A:middle
and wide adoption and
use through iOS apps,

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:29.506 A:middle
we thought that UICollectionView
would therefore form an

00:03:29.566 --> 00:03:31.346 A:middle
excellent basis for the new

00:03:31.346 --> 00:03:33.226 A:middle
and greatly-improved
NSCollectionView

00:03:33.226 --> 00:03:35.106 A:middle
that we're introducing
in El Capitan.

00:03:36.136 --> 00:03:38.816 A:middle
This new NSCollectionView
inherits all

00:03:38.816 --> 00:03:41.316 A:middle
of the scalability
behaviors of UICollectionView.

00:03:42.026 --> 00:03:44.756 A:middle
It knows how to instantiate
items only as needed,

00:03:45.126 --> 00:03:47.156 A:middle
just keeps a few of them
around, a little more

00:03:47.156 --> 00:03:51.376 A:middle
than what's visible and is able
to reuse or recycle items rather

00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:52.336 A:middle
than reinstantiate them.

00:03:52.336 --> 00:03:54.986 A:middle
That saves some overhead, you
can group items in sections,

00:03:55.386 --> 00:03:57.316 A:middle
you can give those sections
header, and footer views,

00:03:57.316 --> 00:03:59.256 A:middle
if you want, put
anything you want in them.



00:04:00.266 --> 00:04:02.316 A:middle
Layout is completely
customizable,

00:04:02.316 --> 00:04:05.856 A:middle
so NSCollectionView is no longer
hard-wired to think I'm a grid.

00:04:06.116 --> 00:04:09.496 A:middle
You can plug any kind of
layout you want into it.

00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:13.436 A:middle
We can handle items that are of
variable sizes, the items can be

00:04:13.436 --> 00:04:15.356 A:middle
of all different types,
you can mix and match,

00:04:15.616 --> 00:04:17.786 A:middle
and Flow Layout especially
is capable

00:04:17.786 --> 00:04:19.625 A:middle
of handling that
very gracefully.

00:04:21.296 --> 00:04:23.686 A:middle
Appearance, as before, it
is completely customizable,

00:04:23.686 --> 00:04:25.906 A:middle
you can define your
Item View subtrees

00:04:25.946 --> 00:04:27.186 A:middle
to look however you want.

00:04:28.076 --> 00:04:31.016 A:middle
The CollectionView is your blank
canvas, to use however you want.

00:04:31.616 --> 00:04:34.496 A:middle
You have control
over animations.

00:04:34.496 --> 00:04:37.226 A:middle
When animations are performed,
and with what durations.

00:04:37.546 --> 00:04:38.466 A:middle
We'll see how to do that.

00:04:39.426 --> 00:04:42.326 A:middle
Of course, not content to
just port UICollectionViews

00:04:42.326 --> 00:04:44.036 A:middle
capabilities to OS X, we wanted

00:04:44.036 --> 00:04:46.816 A:middle
to make the new NSCollectionView
feel really right

00:04:46.816 --> 00:04:48.066 A:middle
at home on the desktop.

00:04:48.306 --> 00:04:50.016 A:middle
One of the important
technologies we deal

00:04:50.016 --> 00:04:51.756 A:middle
with on the desktop
is drag and drop

00:04:51.756 --> 00:04:54.126 A:middle
which NSCollectionView
has supported all along,

00:04:54.496 --> 00:04:57.396 A:middle
but as part of bringing
UICollectionView Layout API

00:04:58.036 --> 00:05:02.136 A:middle
to the desktop, we have
augmented the API with a couple



00:04:58.036 --> 00:05:02.136 A:middle
to the desktop, we have
augmented the API with a couple

00:05:02.136 --> 00:05:03.816 A:middle
of new methods we'll
talk about at the end,

00:05:04.116 --> 00:05:05.896 A:middle
that basically enable
any layout,

00:05:06.146 --> 00:05:10.766 A:middle
including your own custom
layouts, to perform hit-testing

00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:13.026 A:middle
to identify drop
target candidates.

00:05:13.156 --> 00:05:14.386 A:middle
We'll look at how
to do that later.

00:05:15.006 --> 00:05:18.936 A:middle
Any custom layout of your own
design can support Drag-and-Drop

00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:20.316 A:middle
like a first class layout.

00:05:21.046 --> 00:05:24.066 A:middle
Rubber Band Drag Select, you
use that to drag across items,

00:05:24.066 --> 00:05:25.836 A:middle
and select groups
of items in bulk,

00:05:26.666 --> 00:05:28.526 A:middle
that's fully supported
as before.

00:05:28.876 --> 00:05:30.686 A:middle
We have modified the selection

00:05:30.686 --> 00:05:33.106 A:middle
and highlight notification
methods, the delegate methods,

00:05:33.106 --> 00:05:37.156 A:middle
that handle those occurrences,
to be able to handle selection

00:05:37.156 --> 00:05:39.186 A:middle
and highlighting of items in
bulk because that's something

00:05:39.186 --> 00:05:41.196 A:middle
that tends to happen a lot
more on the desktop, you know,

00:05:41.196 --> 00:05:44.216 A:middle
you tend to do a Select All
operation or a Deselect All,

00:05:44.356 --> 00:05:45.466 A:middle
or a big Range Select.

00:05:45.466 --> 00:05:47.586 A:middle
We wanted to be able to
handle those very efficiently.

00:05:47.796 --> 00:05:49.956 A:middle
There is slight adjustments
to the APIs.

00:05:50.786 --> 00:05:54.076 A:middle
As before, however, items
are still represented using

00:05:54.076 --> 00:05:55.646 A:middle
ViewControllers on the desktop.

00:05:55.646 --> 00:05:58.106 A:middle
We think this provides a
great opportunity for you

00:05:58.106 --> 00:06:00.596 A:middle
to compartmentalize
your code neatly,



00:05:58.106 --> 00:06:00.596 A:middle
to compartmentalize
your code neatly,

00:06:00.876 --> 00:06:03.496 A:middle
and have your controller code
separate from your view code.

00:06:04.086 --> 00:06:05.486 A:middle
Better code organization.

00:06:06.806 --> 00:06:09.406 A:middle
One last nice little touch
we added, is the ability

00:06:09.406 --> 00:06:10.566 A:middle
for CollectionView

00:06:10.566 --> 00:06:12.766 A:middle
to automatically find the
appropriate nibs to use

00:06:12.766 --> 00:06:14.716 A:middle
for items, if you just
follow naming conventions,

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.536 A:middle
if you name the nib
identical to the identifier

00:06:17.536 --> 00:06:18.966 A:middle
of the item type
you're requesting

00:06:18.966 --> 00:06:20.506 A:middle
from the CollectionView,
you don't even have

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:24.216 A:middle
to register your item nibs with
the CollectionView anymore.

00:06:24.306 --> 00:06:27.386 A:middle
It saves you a little
work, a little bit of code.

00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:29.226 A:middle
So our goals for
today, I wanted this

00:06:29.226 --> 00:06:31.796 A:middle
to be a really hands-on session,
I want you to walk away ready

00:06:31.796 --> 00:06:32.916 A:middle
to use the new CollectionView.

00:06:33.196 --> 00:06:37.296 A:middle
We'll look at how to wire up one
of these new NSCollectionViews,

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:40.996 A:middle
where we're using the new
API on 10.11, along the way,

00:06:41.296 --> 00:06:44.516 A:middle
we'll learn what's different
on OS X versus on iOS,

00:06:44.516 --> 00:06:46.216 A:middle
and we'll have a
little something

00:06:46.216 --> 00:06:47.426 A:middle
for everybody here I think.

00:06:47.676 --> 00:06:49.806 A:middle
Whether you're a
veteran iOS developer,

00:06:50.156 --> 00:06:52.306 A:middle
maybe bringing companion
apps over to OS X,

00:06:52.306 --> 00:06:54.896 A:middle
you have used UI CollectionView,
you're familiar with the API,

00:06:55.426 --> 00:06:57.916 A:middle
you want to port that knowledge
over, maybe some code over,

00:06:57.966 --> 00:07:00.236 A:middle
we'll have information
useful to you.



00:06:57.966 --> 00:07:00.236 A:middle
we'll have information
useful to you.

00:07:01.266 --> 00:07:03.266 A:middle
Maybe you're an OS
X developer working

00:07:03.296 --> 00:07:05.606 A:middle
with NSCollectionView
already, and you want

00:07:05.606 --> 00:07:08.296 A:middle
to learn the new API
paradigms and how to do that.

00:07:08.296 --> 00:07:09.666 A:middle
We'll have enough
of an introduction

00:07:09.666 --> 00:07:12.316 A:middle
into the UICollectionView
APIs to get you started.

00:07:13.596 --> 00:07:16.396 A:middle
But even if you've not worked
with either before we're going

00:07:16.396 --> 00:07:18.856 A:middle
to have enough introduction,
and enough nuts and bolts

00:07:18.856 --> 00:07:21.816 A:middle
and a code sample, to go
along with today's session

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:24.726 A:middle
that you can study, to learn how
to get up and running quickly

00:07:24.726 --> 00:07:25.716 A:middle
with the new CollectionView.

00:07:26.606 --> 00:07:29.466 A:middle
We'll start with a quick
overview of the concepts,

00:07:29.466 --> 00:07:31.886 A:middle
the basic concepts that we need
to understand about the new API

00:07:31.886 --> 00:07:34.986 A:middle
and then we'll dive into nuts
and bolts of how the API works,

00:07:34.986 --> 00:07:37.266 A:middle
which methods are important,
what to use, and we'll wrap

00:07:37.266 --> 00:07:38.396 A:middle
up with a quick conclusion.

00:07:38.856 --> 00:07:40.116 A:middle
First with that overview.

00:07:40.916 --> 00:07:44.946 A:middle
In the old model of using
CollectionView, NSCollectionView

00:07:44.946 --> 00:07:46.686 A:middle
on OS X 10.10 and earlier,

00:07:47.206 --> 00:07:48.986 A:middle
you would wire your
CollectionView's content

00:07:48.986 --> 00:07:51.156 A:middle
property to an array
or array controller

00:07:51.156 --> 00:07:53.626 A:middle
that references your model
objects, that's how you wire

00:07:53.626 --> 00:07:55.996 A:middle
up your model, and you
provide an item prototype,

00:07:56.116 --> 00:07:59.296 A:middle
that's an NSCollectionView item,
a subclass of ViewControllers,

00:07:59.296 --> 00:08:00.536 A:middle
you have basically
got a ViewController,



00:07:59.296 --> 00:08:00.536 A:middle
you have basically
got a ViewController,

00:08:00.826 --> 00:08:03.596 A:middle
and an associated view subtree,
and this is what's going

00:08:03.596 --> 00:08:05.716 A:middle
to get cloned to populate
your CollectionView.

00:08:06.396 --> 00:08:08.546 A:middle
Lastly, yourCollectionView
might have a delegate,

00:08:08.546 --> 00:08:09.956 A:middle
if you want to support
Drag-and-Drop,

00:08:10.286 --> 00:08:12.066 A:middle
that's your delegate's
responsibility,

00:08:12.346 --> 00:08:15.226 A:middle
so you would wire up
a delegate for that.

00:08:15.546 --> 00:08:17.776 A:middle
With the new API, a few of
these things have changed.

00:08:17.776 --> 00:08:20.786 A:middle
Instead of providing a content
array, what you are going

00:08:20.786 --> 00:08:24.256 A:middle
to do now on El Capitan,
is wire up a data source.

00:08:24.486 --> 00:08:27.446 A:middle
The data source protocol for
CollectionView is very simple,

00:08:27.446 --> 00:08:29.656 A:middle
as in iOS there are only
two required methods,

00:08:29.846 --> 00:08:32.056 A:middle
it's very quick and easy
as you will see to wire

00:08:32.056 --> 00:08:33.686 A:middle
up your model to CollectionView.

00:08:34.926 --> 00:08:36.546 A:middle
You still have a
delegate, as before,

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:39.496 A:middle
but now the delegate has the
opportunity to participate

00:08:39.496 --> 00:08:41.376 A:middle
in selection and
highlighting of items.

00:08:41.376 --> 00:08:42.775 A:middle
We'll talk about
that in detail later.

00:08:43.226 --> 00:08:46.526 A:middle
Instead of an item prototype
you now typically provide a nib

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.386 A:middle
file, that hasyour
example item in it,

00:08:49.386 --> 00:08:51.016 A:middle
and it's associatedview subtree.

00:08:51.276 --> 00:08:53.646 A:middle
You're not limited to just one
of these, as I said, you can mix

00:08:53.646 --> 00:08:54.956 A:middle
and match different
types of items,

00:08:54.956 --> 00:08:57.286 A:middle
you can have multiple nib files,
one for for each type of item

00:08:57.596 --> 00:09:00.406 A:middle
and the view trees can be
completely different for these.



00:08:57.596 --> 00:09:00.406 A:middle
and the view trees can be
completely different for these.

00:09:00.896 --> 00:09:03.176 A:middle
Last but not least,
very importantly,

00:09:03.756 --> 00:09:06.606 A:middle
we have taken the layout
functionality and factored it

00:09:06.606 --> 00:09:08.896 A:middle
out of CollectionView so
it is no longer hard wired.

00:09:08.896 --> 00:09:11.536 A:middle
We now have a very
modular model, like on iOS,

00:09:12.216 --> 00:09:14.086 A:middle
so you can take your
existing CollectionView,

00:09:14.416 --> 00:09:16.716 A:middle
unplug the layout that's
currently connected to it,

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:20.556 A:middle
plug in a different layout, and
suddenly your items are laid

00:09:20.556 --> 00:09:23.246 A:middle
out with different sizes using
a completely different layout

00:09:23.246 --> 00:09:26.536 A:middle
algorithm, and these layouts
are completely interchangeable,

00:09:26.536 --> 00:09:28.666 A:middle
nd you can even make the
change to a different layout

00:09:28.886 --> 00:09:31.146 A:middle
in an animated-transition
kind of way.

00:09:31.186 --> 00:09:34.066 A:middle
very easily, as ourcode
sample does.

00:09:34.736 --> 00:09:37.996 A:middle
For customizing layout, your
layout can also delegate

00:09:37.996 --> 00:09:39.456 A:middle
to your CollectionViews
delegate.

00:09:39.456 --> 00:09:42.016 A:middle
You can implement certain
optional methods to allow you

00:09:42.016 --> 00:09:43.886 A:middle
to make per-item
layout adjustments.

00:09:43.886 --> 00:09:45.826 A:middle
You don't even necessarily
have to subclass,

00:09:46.096 --> 00:09:47.216 A:middle
if you want a custom layout.

00:09:48.036 --> 00:09:49.836 A:middle
We'll take a quick look
at the layout classes.

00:09:49.836 --> 00:09:52.076 A:middle
These arevery similar but
not identical, on iOS.

00:09:52.076 --> 00:09:54.616 A:middle
As on iOS,
NSCollectionViewLayout,

00:09:54.616 --> 00:09:57.556 A:middle
his is the base class that
defines the common behavior,

00:09:57.556 --> 00:09:59.396 A:middle
the API interface
for all layouts.



00:10:00.446 --> 00:10:03.396 A:middle
NSCollectionViewGridLayout
is new and unique to OS X

00:10:03.396 --> 00:10:06.686 A:middle
and its job is basically
encapsulate NSCollectionView's

00:10:06.686 --> 00:10:09.756 A:middle
existing, sort of stretchy
grid layout algoritm,

00:10:09.956 --> 00:10:12.296 A:middle
in case you want to use
it with the new APIs.

00:10:12.296 --> 00:10:15.636 A:middle
It gives you a stretchy
grid, where it tries

00:10:15.636 --> 00:10:19.836 A:middle
to make all items the same
size, but they're limited to min

00:10:19.836 --> 00:10:21.136 A:middle
and max sizes, and it tries

00:10:21.186 --> 00:10:23.896 A:middle
to basically fill its visible
area as much as possible.

00:10:24.456 --> 00:10:26.306 A:middle
Sometimes useful,
but this is sort

00:10:26.306 --> 00:10:27.666 A:middle
of a legacy layout right now.

00:10:27.716 --> 00:10:30.446 A:middle
It doesn't yet support sections
or header or footer views

00:10:30.756 --> 00:10:33.216 A:middle
and FlowLayout is
generally much more flexible.

00:10:34.036 --> 00:10:35.846 A:middle
We usually recommend that
you you start with that.

00:10:35.846 --> 00:10:38.266 A:middle
NSCollectionViewFlowLayout
is basically identical

00:10:38.496 --> 00:10:41.776 A:middle
to UICollectionViewFlowLayout
on iOS, it's a very powerful,

00:10:41.776 --> 00:10:45.326 A:middle
general layout algorithm,
and the algorithm is much

00:10:45.326 --> 00:10:49.636 A:middle
like flowing text fragments
or CSS boxes in flow,

00:10:49.636 --> 00:10:51.406 A:middle
if you've dealt with
either of those problems.

00:10:51.596 --> 00:10:53.906 A:middle
Basically, you can have
variable item sizes,

00:10:54.136 --> 00:10:56.416 A:middle
and the layout algorithm
canhandle that nicely.

00:10:56.696 --> 00:10:59.626 A:middle
It willrack up items
into rows or columns,

00:10:59.626 --> 00:11:01.576 A:middle
depending which orientation
you give it.



00:10:59.626 --> 00:11:01.576 A:middle
depending which orientation
you give it.

00:11:01.996 --> 00:11:03.656 A:middle
When it fills up
a row or column,

00:11:03.656 --> 00:11:05.716 A:middle
it'll wrap to a new
one and continue on.

00:11:06.116 --> 00:11:08.986 A:middle
FlowLayout supports
sections with optional header

00:11:08.986 --> 00:11:11.306 A:middle
and footer views, and it
is generally very powerful

00:11:11.306 --> 00:11:13.706 A:middle
and customizable, so even
if you do need to subclass,

00:11:15.026 --> 00:11:17.266 A:middle
usually you'll want to start
with FlowLayout, and subclass

00:11:17.266 --> 00:11:18.596 A:middle
from there to get what you want.

00:11:18.596 --> 00:11:21.986 A:middle
You're always free to subclass
NSCollectionViewLayout,

00:11:22.646 --> 00:11:24.406 A:middle
to get a completely
custom layout.

00:11:24.486 --> 00:11:28.186 A:middle
Our sample code todaydoes
just that.

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:32.146 A:middle
Layout attributes objects aren't
always immediately intuitive

00:11:32.146 --> 00:11:34.326 A:middle
to those who look at
them for the first time.

00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:36.676 A:middle
This is a concept -- the
same concept as on iOS,

00:11:37.206 --> 00:11:39.456 A:middle
and once you understand what it
is, it really is very simple.

00:11:40.276 --> 00:11:42.946 A:middle
Imagine that you can
take a view's frame

00:11:43.246 --> 00:11:44.916 A:middle
and other assorted properties

00:11:44.916 --> 00:11:47.306 A:middle
and encapsulate them
separately from the view.

00:11:47.306 --> 00:11:49.846 A:middle
That's what LayoutAttributes'
job is.

00:11:49.846 --> 00:11:51.746 A:middle
You have an instance
of these frames,

00:11:51.746 --> 00:11:53.026 A:middle
the most obvious one , right?

00:11:53.026 --> 00:11:56.496 A:middle
you need to know the
position and size of an item,

00:11:56.766 --> 00:11:59.376 A:middle
but there are other ancillary
attributes, such as Alpha value,

00:11:59.376 --> 00:12:03.036 A:middle
Opacity in other words, Zindex
for back-to-front sort order,



00:11:59.376 --> 00:12:03.036 A:middle
Opacity in other words, Zindex
for back-to-front sort order,

00:12:03.976 --> 00:12:05.536 A:middle
and whether the view
is hidden or not,

00:12:05.536 --> 00:12:07.586 A:middle
which can also be
considered layout state.

00:12:07.586 --> 00:12:09.426 A:middle
You're taking state,
and snapshotting it,

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:13.666 A:middle
what this enables the new APIs
to do, is to reason about items

00:12:13.916 --> 00:12:15.846 A:middle
that are not currently
instantiated.

00:12:15.846 --> 00:12:18.446 A:middle
Remember, we're just lazily
instantiating items on demand.

00:12:19.146 --> 00:12:21.526 A:middle
We end up creating these,
and passing them around,

00:12:21.526 --> 00:12:23.066 A:middle
these layout attributes
instances,

00:12:23.286 --> 00:12:26.316 A:middle
that's what the Layout APIs
deal with, they pass them around

00:12:26.536 --> 00:12:29.066 A:middle
and then eventually they end
up getting applied to items

00:12:29.066 --> 00:12:30.246 A:middle
or views at layout time.

00:12:30.396 --> 00:12:33.406 A:middle
Applied in the sense of
setting an animation target

00:12:33.406 --> 00:12:35.066 A:middle
for a transition to a new state.

00:12:35.426 --> 00:12:36.496 A:middle
That's all they are really.

00:12:37.036 --> 00:12:40.986 A:middle
You can group items, that's
pretty straightforward,

00:12:40.986 --> 00:12:43.136 A:middle
you can break your items
up into groups now,

00:12:43.336 --> 00:12:47.116 A:middle
each group can potentially
have a header above it,

00:12:47.116 --> 00:12:49.746 A:middle
and a footer below it, or
this also works sideways,

00:12:49.746 --> 00:12:51.446 A:middle
ifyou're doing that orientation.

00:12:52.246 --> 00:12:54.556 A:middle
The header, and footer,
together with the items

00:12:54.556 --> 00:12:56.226 A:middle
that they bracket,
constitute a section,

00:12:56.226 --> 00:12:58.066 A:middle
our first section
here is section 0.

00:12:58.376 --> 00:13:01.826 A:middle
The items within that section
are numbered 0, 1, 2, so on.



00:12:58.376 --> 00:13:01.826 A:middle
The items within that section
are numbered 0, 1, 2, so on.

00:13:02.506 --> 00:13:04.166 A:middle
This is exactly the
same as on iOS.

00:13:04.626 --> 00:13:06.516 A:middle
The next section can have
a header, a footer view,

00:13:06.936 --> 00:13:09.176 A:middle
together with the items,
now we've got section 1

00:13:09.176 --> 00:13:12.216 A:middle
and the items in that
section are again numbered 0,

00:13:12.306 --> 00:13:13.806 A:middle
1, 2, and so forth.

00:13:14.526 --> 00:13:17.736 A:middle
So clearly we have a need for a
different way to address items.

00:13:17.736 --> 00:13:19.996 A:middle
We're going to start addressing
items like we do on iOS.

00:13:19.996 --> 00:13:21.826 A:middle
We need to know not
only the item index,

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:23.356 A:middle
but the section index.

00:13:23.736 --> 00:13:26.506 A:middle
This has consequences for
existing APIs, and accounts

00:13:26.506 --> 00:13:28.826 A:middle
for a lot of the API
changes that you will see.

00:13:29.346 --> 00:13:31.296 A:middle
For example, the
ItemAtIndex method,

00:13:31.296 --> 00:13:33.656 A:middle
which takes a single-integer
index,

00:13:33.656 --> 00:13:36.326 A:middle
is no longer sufficient.Now
that we have sections,

00:13:36.326 --> 00:13:37.736 A:middle
we need to know the
section number too.

00:13:38.186 --> 00:13:41.346 A:middle
So APIs like this are now
soft-deprecated in favor of ones

00:13:41.386 --> 00:13:43.306 A:middle
that take index paths.

00:13:43.306 --> 00:13:46.016 A:middle
And NSIndexPath is just
an existing value type

00:13:46.016 --> 00:13:49.286 A:middle
that lets us very conveniently
encapsulate a section index,

00:13:49.286 --> 00:13:52.306 A:middle
and an item index, together
in an object, a value object

00:13:52.506 --> 00:13:54.926 A:middle
that we can pass around,
throw into collections, so on.

00:13:55.266 --> 00:13:57.696 A:middle
A lot of the API changes you
will see actually are just

00:13:57.696 --> 00:13:59.806 A:middle
accountfor this simple
transition away

00:13:59.806 --> 00:14:01.096 A:middle
from single item indices.



00:13:59.806 --> 00:14:01.096 A:middle
from single item indices.

00:14:01.416 --> 00:14:03.176 A:middle
You can still use the old APIs

00:14:03.406 --> 00:14:05.626 A:middle
if you have a single-section
CollectionView,

00:14:05.626 --> 00:14:08.536 A:middle
which is the default, but if
you might be using sections,

00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:12.516 A:middle
we encourage you to
use the new APIs.

00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:14.586 A:middle
We're obviously starting
to get into nuts and bolts,

00:14:14.586 --> 00:14:18.616 A:middle
we'll embrace that, and get down
to looking at our example code.

00:14:18.616 --> 00:14:20.906 A:middle
The example today is
CocoaSlideCollection,

00:14:20.906 --> 00:14:22.426 A:middle
and it's basically
an image browser

00:14:22.646 --> 00:14:25.696 A:middle
that uses a CollectionView
to present a folder

00:14:25.696 --> 00:14:28.206 A:middle
of ImageFiles for
you to look at.

00:14:28.816 --> 00:14:30.456 A:middle
For each ImageFile
in the folder,

00:14:30.456 --> 00:14:34.156 A:middle
we show a thumbnail image
and assorted image info.

00:14:34.716 --> 00:14:40.106 A:middle
We position these using the
Flow layout that comes stock

00:14:40.106 --> 00:14:42.016 A:middle
on the system, and our
own custom layouts,

00:14:42.016 --> 00:14:43.076 A:middle
that you will see
how to implement.

00:14:43.596 --> 00:14:46.556 A:middle
We're going to suppose that each

00:14:46.556 --> 00:14:49.036 A:middle
of our Image Files can have
tags associated with it

00:14:49.036 --> 00:14:51.026 A:middle
and we're going to
use that as an excuse

00:14:51.026 --> 00:14:53.186 A:middle
to show off the ability to
have sections with headers

00:14:53.186 --> 00:14:57.916 A:middle
and footers, we're going to be
able togroup our items by tag.

00:14:57.916 --> 00:15:00.456 A:middle
We'll also support
selection and Drag-and-Drop



00:14:57.916 --> 00:15:00.456 A:middle
We'll also support
selection and Drag-and-Drop

00:15:00.456 --> 00:15:03.536 A:middle
of our items using the APIs
that we'll discuss today.

00:15:04.636 --> 00:15:06.556 A:middle
To break this down into
parts, we'll break it

00:15:06.556 --> 00:15:09.406 A:middle
down into six parts, so we
can do this step by step.

00:15:09.686 --> 00:15:11.646 A:middle
First, of course, we want
to make items appear.

00:15:11.646 --> 00:15:12.586 A:middle
That's always nice.

00:15:12.586 --> 00:15:13.536 A:middle
That's the big hurdle.

00:15:13.806 --> 00:15:16.146 A:middle
When you get stuff to show
up, you can get more advanced.

00:15:16.146 --> 00:15:17.246 A:middle
We'll do that quickly.

00:15:17.826 --> 00:15:20.146 A:middle
Thenwe'll look at grouping
those items into sections.

00:15:20.976 --> 00:15:23.056 A:middle
Next we want to look
at how do we handle it

00:15:23.056 --> 00:15:25.616 A:middle
when the model changes,
the ImageFiles come and go,

00:15:25.616 --> 00:15:27.026 A:middle
how do we update
our CollectionView.

00:15:27.026 --> 00:15:28.426 A:middle
We'll see how to
do that properly.

00:15:28.426 --> 00:15:30.716 A:middle
We'll look at handling
selection, and highlighting,

00:15:30.716 --> 00:15:33.666 A:middle
of the semantics of that,
handling Drag-and-Drop and last

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:35.646 A:middle
but not least, the really
fun part, we'll look at how

00:15:35.646 --> 00:15:37.326 A:middle
to make custom layouts
of ourown.

00:15:37.746 --> 00:15:40.926 A:middle
First, making items appear,
back to our model here.

00:15:40.926 --> 00:15:42.286 A:middle
This is the new API again.

00:15:42.966 --> 00:15:44.486 A:middle
We need to provide a data source

00:15:44.616 --> 00:15:46.526 A:middle
that implements those
two required methods.

00:15:47.366 --> 00:15:50.246 A:middle
We'll need to provide an
item nib, simple enough.

00:15:50.356 --> 00:15:51.906 A:middle
Then a CollectionView layout.

00:15:53.146 --> 00:15:56.246 A:middle
The two required methods are
simply give the CollectionView

00:15:56.246 --> 00:15:59.316 A:middle
the ability to ask how many
items are in this section,

00:15:59.316 --> 00:16:01.486 A:middle
by default we have one
section, it is going to pass 0



00:15:59.316 --> 00:16:01.486 A:middle
by default we have one
section, it is going to pass 0

00:16:01.486 --> 00:16:03.706 A:middle
for the section index, it'll
just return the number of items.

00:16:04.276 --> 00:16:06.386 A:middle
The second method's
responsibility,

00:16:06.386 --> 00:16:09.136 A:middle
is to actually instantiate
items,

00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:11.866 A:middle
or it could be actually
reusing the recycled items

00:16:11.866 --> 00:16:14.446 A:middle
under the hood, with help
from the CollectionView

00:16:14.446 --> 00:16:15.816 A:middle
and return them back
to the CollectionView.

00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:20.516 A:middle
In CocoaSlideCollection
our basic model object

00:16:20.516 --> 00:16:22.066 A:middle
to understand is the ImageFile.

00:16:22.796 --> 00:16:26.686 A:middle
An ImageFile basically
references a URL of an ImageFile

00:16:26.686 --> 00:16:28.646 A:middle
that we found on disk in
the folder we're scanning,

00:16:28.646 --> 00:16:30.606 A:middle
that includes the file name
that we're displaying at the top

00:16:30.606 --> 00:16:32.956 A:middle
of the slide, the file's type

00:16:33.016 --> 00:16:35.796 A:middle
which we displayed a
user-readable description of,

00:16:36.096 --> 00:16:38.126 A:middle
the pixel dimensions
of the original image,

00:16:39.056 --> 00:16:40.706 A:middle
then a thumbnail, of course.

00:16:41.196 --> 00:16:44.866 A:middle
You will see those
around in the source code.

00:16:45.306 --> 00:16:48.136 A:middle
An image collection owns
an array of ImageFiles,

00:16:48.136 --> 00:16:51.386 A:middle
An image collection also
owns an array of tags,

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:53.596 A:middle
each of which owns an array
of ImageFiles that have

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:56.716 A:middle
that tag applied, and there is
an untagged ImageFiles array

00:16:56.716 --> 00:16:57.136 A:middle
as well.

00:16:57.946 --> 00:17:00.176 A:middle
First we'll look at
making items appear.



00:16:57.946 --> 00:17:00.176 A:middle
First we'll look at
making items appear.

00:17:00.176 --> 00:17:01.516 A:middle
We'll go over to the
demo machine here.

00:17:02.746 --> 00:17:05.215 A:middle
Let's get this up and running.

00:17:05.386 --> 00:17:06.796 A:middle
We'll open our Xcode project.

00:17:09.256 --> 00:17:12.836 A:middle
Things are, you know,
mostly ready to go,

00:17:12.836 --> 00:17:14.566 A:middle
but we have no CollectionView
in our window.

00:17:14.566 --> 00:17:15.636 A:middle
That's going to be a problem.

00:17:15.636 --> 00:17:17.695 A:middle
We'll look at how to
actually get a CollectionView.

00:17:19.536 --> 00:17:23.066 A:middle
So going into our
Resources group here.

00:17:23.066 --> 00:17:25.996 A:middle
We have a BrowserWindow nib
that holds our main window.

00:17:27.086 --> 00:17:29.186 A:middle
Let's look at that.

00:17:29.456 --> 00:17:35.326 A:middle
We'll go in the library here,
and search for a CollectionView.

00:17:35.776 --> 00:17:42.346 A:middle
We'll drag it out.

00:17:42.646 --> 00:17:44.256 A:middle
We'll size it to
fill our window.

00:17:45.766 --> 00:17:46.956 A:middle
Apply constraints to it.

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:53.736 A:middle
That's going to be our main
document view for this window.

00:17:53.736 --> 00:17:57.866 A:middle
Okay. Now what we did, what we
actually got when we dragged

00:17:57.866 --> 00:17:59.656 A:middle
out a CollectionView,
this is a lot like working

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:02.436 A:middle
with a Table View
or Outline View,



00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:02.436 A:middle
with a Table View
or Outline View,

00:18:02.816 --> 00:18:04.716 A:middle
you're actually getting
a CollectionView embedded

00:18:04.716 --> 00:18:06.466 A:middle
in a scroll view unlike on iOS.

00:18:06.656 --> 00:18:09.466 A:middle
Scroll view is a separate
thing that's composed

00:18:09.466 --> 00:18:11.046 A:middle
with a document view
that you want to scroll,

00:18:11.046 --> 00:18:12.596 A:middle
you don't inherit the
scrolling behavior,

00:18:12.596 --> 00:18:13.786 A:middle
it is done through composition.

00:18:14.996 --> 00:18:15.906 A:middle
We have a scroll view.

00:18:15.996 --> 00:18:18.686 A:middle
I said that the new
CollectionView is designed

00:18:18.686 --> 00:18:20.596 A:middle
to run layer-backs, we're
going to go over here

00:18:20.596 --> 00:18:24.106 A:middle
to our inspector, and we'll set
the [indecipherable] property

00:18:24.106 --> 00:18:26.416 A:middle
on the scroll view to
ensure layer-backing.

00:18:27.126 --> 00:18:29.666 A:middle
Now, we'll drill down to
the CollectionView itself,

00:18:29.666 --> 00:18:32.586 A:middle
which is the scroll
view's document view.

00:18:32.586 --> 00:18:35.056 A:middle
We have a new properties
inspector here in Xcode 7

00:18:35.056 --> 00:18:36.706 A:middle
that supports some of
the new capabilities.

00:18:36.706 --> 00:18:39.406 A:middle
We choose a layout we
want to use, such as Flow,

00:18:39.406 --> 00:18:40.726 A:middle
and even set its properties.

00:18:41.116 --> 00:18:42.536 A:middle
In this sample app
we're actually going

00:18:42.536 --> 00:18:44.326 A:middle
to switch programmatically
between the layouts,

00:18:44.326 --> 00:18:46.546 A:middle
so we don't really need the one
with we unarchived from the nib,

00:18:46.956 --> 00:18:48.156 A:middle
but we can set that there.

00:18:48.486 --> 00:18:52.086 A:middle
You can do fun, simple things,
like set the background color,

00:18:52.346 --> 00:18:59.296 A:middle
as soon as I find
the color panel.

00:18:59.536 --> 00:19:00.976 A:middle
The more interesting thing,
is that you have to hook



00:18:59.536 --> 00:19:00.976 A:middle
The more interesting thing,
is that you have to hook

00:19:00.976 --> 00:19:02.126 A:middle
up that data source, right?

00:19:02.956 --> 00:19:08.286 A:middle
So, our file's owner in
this project is an instance

00:19:08.426 --> 00:19:10.626 A:middle
of APL Browser Window
Controller.

00:19:10.696 --> 00:19:12.466 A:middle
We have a window controller
that manages the window,

00:19:12.466 --> 00:19:14.466 A:middle
that's also going tp be our
data source, and our delegate

00:19:14.466 --> 00:19:15.386 A:middle
for our CollectionView.

00:19:15.386 --> 00:19:18.836 A:middle
We'll wire that up here
from the CollectionView

00:19:18.996 --> 00:19:20.066 A:middle
to the file's owner, it's going

00:19:20.066 --> 00:19:21.686 A:middle
to be the CollectionView's
data source.

00:19:21.816 --> 00:19:24.596 A:middle
It will be its delegate too, to
so we can handle Drag-and-Drop,

00:19:25.056 --> 00:19:27.246 A:middle
we'll wire from the file's owner
back to the CollectionView,

00:19:27.246 --> 00:19:30.066 A:middle
we have an ImageCollectionView
outlet that we've defined

00:19:30.066 --> 00:19:32.056 A:middle
to make it easier to
find our CollectionView.

00:19:33.486 --> 00:19:36.416 A:middle
That's basically what we
need to do in our nibs.

00:19:36.776 --> 00:19:39.296 A:middle
We have also got a slide
nib that we created.

00:19:39.836 --> 00:19:43.686 A:middle
It holds basically a container
view that's referenced

00:19:43.686 --> 00:19:48.046 A:middle
by a slide, our slide class
is a subclass of collection,

00:19:48.046 --> 00:19:49.216 A:middle
NSCollectionViewItems.

00:19:49.216 --> 00:19:51.916 A:middle
We've subclassed so we can
add some functionality there,

00:19:51.916 --> 00:19:53.716 A:middle
our own custom controller
functionality,

00:19:54.226 --> 00:19:56.856 A:middle
the root view is just a
container that will be sized

00:19:57.116 --> 00:19:58.976 A:middle
by the CollectionView's
layout algorithm.

00:19:59.456 --> 00:20:00.796 A:middle
Then, we have controls,



00:19:59.456 --> 00:20:00.796 A:middle
Then, we have controls,

00:20:00.796 --> 00:20:06.506 A:middle
text fields that have autolayout
constraints set on them,

00:20:06.506 --> 00:20:07.756 A:middle
relative to their containers.

00:20:07.756 --> 00:20:11.046 A:middle
The layout will set the frame of
the item, the item's root view,

00:20:11.276 --> 00:20:13.816 A:middle
and the rest will all be done
by autolayout internally.

00:20:14.296 --> 00:20:16.466 A:middle
I have also used bindings

00:20:16.526 --> 00:20:21.076 A:middle
to basically connect the
value displayed by each

00:20:21.076 --> 00:20:25.186 A:middle
of these text fields, through
the slides-represented object.

00:20:25.186 --> 00:20:27.746 A:middle
Remember a slide is a
CollectionView item,

00:20:28.116 --> 00:20:29.236 A:middle
therefore it is a
ViewController,

00:20:29.236 --> 00:20:30.946 A:middle
ViewController has a
represented object.

00:20:30.946 --> 00:20:32.786 A:middle
That's where we're going
to connect our item

00:20:33.096 --> 00:20:34.816 A:middle
to the model object
it represents,

00:20:34.816 --> 00:20:36.196 A:middle
to the ImageFile instance.

00:20:36.626 --> 00:20:38.596 A:middle
We can access properties
of that instance.

00:20:39.036 --> 00:20:41.466 A:middle
All we really are going to
need to do is wire our item

00:20:41.466 --> 00:20:44.676 A:middle
up to the represented object,
i.e. its ImageFile, and then all

00:20:44.676 --> 00:20:46.186 A:middle
of these controls
will just populate,

00:20:46.186 --> 00:20:47.976 A:middle
including the image
view over here.

00:20:48.696 --> 00:20:52.836 A:middle
Because we're using a separate
nib file for the modern API

00:20:53.046 --> 00:20:55.876 A:middle
for CollectionView, we're
going to prune some stuff

00:20:55.936 --> 00:20:58.516 A:middle
that Xcode put in
here by default still.

00:20:58.816 --> 00:21:01.566 A:middle
Our image CollectionView
still has an item prototype.



00:20:58.816 --> 00:21:01.566 A:middle
Our image CollectionView
still has an item prototype.

00:21:02.516 --> 00:21:03.546 A:middle
We want to get rid of that.

00:21:03.546 --> 00:21:04.336 A:middle
Let's unwire it.

00:21:05.626 --> 00:21:07.176 A:middle
That will interfere
with what we're doing.

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:08.856 A:middle
We'll delete the item prototype,

00:21:08.856 --> 00:21:10.736 A:middle
we'll delete the views
associated with it.

00:21:10.736 --> 00:21:11.596 A:middle
We don't need those.

00:21:12.096 --> 00:21:14.056 A:middle
We can build and
we're almost okay.

00:21:14.686 --> 00:21:16.656 A:middle
If we look in the warnings
here, we see a reminder,

00:21:16.656 --> 00:21:19.616 A:middle
we didn't implement the
required data source methods,

00:21:19.616 --> 00:21:21.586 A:middle
there are just two of them, so
let's go do that real quick.

00:21:22.646 --> 00:21:24.166 A:middle
We'll go to Browser
Window Controller.

00:21:24.796 --> 00:21:28.866 A:middle
Look here, where the data
source methods should be.

00:21:28.926 --> 00:21:34.476 A:middle
Fortunately I typed
some in advance.

00:21:34.476 --> 00:21:39.606 A:middle
We'll just drag in.

00:21:39.996 --> 00:21:42.026 A:middle
For a non-section CollectionView
this is very simple,

00:21:42.026 --> 00:21:44.686 A:middle
we implement CollectionView,
number of items in section

00:21:44.686 --> 00:21:46.776 A:middle
by default, the CollectionView
assumes one section,

00:21:47.066 --> 00:21:48.866 A:middle
we return the count
of ImageFiles

00:21:49.146 --> 00:21:51.766 A:middle
in our image collection,
and the other thing we need

00:21:51.766 --> 00:21:53.566 A:middle
to do is make items on demand.

00:21:53.626 --> 00:21:55.826 A:middle
The CollectionView will
send us CollectionView Item

00:21:55.826 --> 00:21:57.566 A:middle
For Represented Object
At Index Path.

00:21:58.206 --> 00:21:59.826 A:middle
The important thing here
is that we're calling back

00:21:59.896 --> 00:22:01.416 A:middle
to the CollectionView,
and saying make item



00:21:59.896 --> 00:22:01.416 A:middle
to the CollectionView,
and saying make item

00:22:01.416 --> 00:22:03.616 A:middle
with identifier, which
is a little misleading,

00:22:03.616 --> 00:22:05.186 A:middle
make really means
make or give me

00:22:05.186 --> 00:22:08.866 A:middle
than existing one you can
recycle for index path.

00:22:08.866 --> 00:22:10.836 A:middle
We just pass in the index
path that we were given,

00:22:10.836 --> 00:22:11.986 A:middle
that identifies the item.

00:22:12.876 --> 00:22:15.646 A:middle
As I said, we want to wire up
the items represented objects,

00:22:15.646 --> 00:22:18.096 A:middle
so we can find the corresponding
properties to display just

00:22:18.096 --> 00:22:19.156 A:middle
for that item instance.

00:22:19.156 --> 00:22:22.406 A:middle
We've got a little method
here that we factored out,

00:22:22.406 --> 00:22:24.526 A:middle
ImageFile At Index
Path, that lets us dig

00:22:24.526 --> 00:22:25.956 A:middle
into our data model real simply,

00:22:25.956 --> 00:22:28.876 A:middle
and find the corresponding
ImageFile instance.

00:22:29.316 --> 00:22:31.346 A:middle
That's all we need to
do, return the item back

00:22:31.466 --> 00:22:32.336 A:middle
to the CollectionView.

00:22:33.076 --> 00:22:35.526 A:middle
If we're feeling brave maybe
we can build and run this,

00:22:35.526 --> 00:22:36.826 A:middle
and see if it actually works.

00:22:37.266 --> 00:22:39.226 A:middle
So, we're going to come
up with -- there you go.

00:22:39.226 --> 00:22:40.996 A:middle
By default we have
a window pointing

00:22:40.996 --> 00:22:43.866 A:middle
at library desktop pictures,
and it scans that folder.

00:22:43.866 --> 00:22:46.086 A:middle
It looks for the ImageFiles

00:22:46.126 --> 00:22:48.036 A:middle
and presents them using
CollectionView items

00:22:48.036 --> 00:22:50.606 A:middle
and we scroll through here, the
items that were out of view,

00:22:50.606 --> 00:22:53.766 A:middle
are actually being instantiated
on demand, or even recycled

00:22:53.766 --> 00:22:56.256 A:middle
from items that just
scrolled off the top.

00:22:57.006 --> 00:22:59.356 A:middle
You can resize, the
layout reflows



00:23:00.486 --> 00:23:02.496 A:middle
and we get a lot
of stuff for free.

00:23:02.496 --> 00:23:04.516 A:middle
This is, I call it the
wrapped layout here,

00:23:04.616 --> 00:23:06.996 A:middle
it is a simple subclass
of the Flow layout,

00:23:07.536 --> 00:23:09.986 A:middle
then we have some custom layouts
that we have implemented, -

00:23:11.286 --> 00:23:12.876 A:middle
we can layout - these
are implemented

00:23:12.876 --> 00:23:16.306 A:middle
by plugging a different layout
object into the CollectionView.

00:23:17.276 --> 00:23:19.616 A:middle
We have got group by tag here,

00:23:19.616 --> 00:23:21.816 A:middle
but that doesn't
really do anything yet.

00:23:21.816 --> 00:23:23.706 A:middle
Let's go back to the slides

00:23:23.756 --> 00:23:26.516 A:middle
and see what it takes
to get that working.

00:23:28.016 --> 00:23:29.516 A:middle
[Applause]

00:23:29.516 --> 00:23:30.716 A:middle
Thank you.

00:23:33.806 --> 00:23:37.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That's always a good start,
to get the first demo running.

00:23:37.656 --> 00:23:40.426 A:middle
Now we want to group the
ImageFiles by tag, not satisfied

00:23:40.426 --> 00:23:42.046 A:middle
to display them in one
section, we want to see

00:23:42.046 --> 00:23:43.646 A:middle
which ones correspond
to which tags.

00:23:44.156 --> 00:23:47.666 A:middle
What we're going to do, for
each tag we have an array

00:23:47.666 --> 00:23:48.736 A:middle
of ImageFiles.

00:23:49.126 --> 00:23:51.166 A:middle
That are implicitly
ordered in some way,

00:23:51.166 --> 00:23:52.986 A:middle
and we want to show
them in that order.

00:23:53.586 --> 00:23:56.676 A:middle
An ImageFile may have many
tags, meaning we'll show it

00:23:56.676 --> 00:23:57.796 A:middle
in more than one section.

00:23:57.796 --> 00:23:58.386 A:middle
That's fine.

00:23:58.956 --> 00:24:02.116 A:middle
We also may have ImageFiles that
don't appear in any section.



00:23:58.956 --> 00:24:02.116 A:middle
We also may have ImageFiles that
don't appear in any section.

00:24:02.116 --> 00:24:04.486 A:middle
We are going to have an
untagged ImageFile section,

00:24:04.486 --> 00:24:05.986 A:middle
one additional section
at the end.

00:24:05.986 --> 00:24:07.116 A:middle
Where we show all
of the ImageFiles

00:24:07.116 --> 00:24:09.116 A:middle
with that have no tag.

00:24:09.116 --> 00:24:11.456 A:middle
We'll give each of our sections
a header and footer view,

00:24:11.456 --> 00:24:13.186 A:middle
because we want to show
off that we can do that.

00:24:13.836 --> 00:24:15.506 A:middle
Show you how to do it.

00:24:15.856 --> 00:24:19.286 A:middle
As with item types, the
instantiation process for header

00:24:19.286 --> 00:24:21.036 A:middle
and footer views, you'll
see, is very similar.

00:24:21.646 --> 00:24:27.166 A:middle
A header or footer is in general
considered what CollectionView

00:24:27.166 --> 00:24:30.616 A:middle
calls a supplementary view,
it doesn't represent an item,

00:24:30.616 --> 00:24:32.156 A:middle
but [is] something
that sort of augments,

00:24:32.156 --> 00:24:35.216 A:middle
or brackets the display of items
such as a header or footer.

00:24:36.396 --> 00:24:38.976 A:middle
We're going to implement
the data source as optional,

00:24:38.976 --> 00:24:41.676 A:middle
CollectionView, View For
Supplementary Element OF Kind,

00:24:41.676 --> 00:24:43.866 A:middle
that is a fancy way of asking,
in our case, for a header

00:24:43.866 --> 00:24:46.526 A:middle
or footer, with a
given index path.

00:24:47.116 --> 00:24:51.826 A:middle
We'll go back to the
demo machine for that.

00:24:52.756 --> 00:24:54.986 A:middle
We'll hook this up real quick.

00:24:56.396 --> 00:24:59.036 A:middle
We'll need to take our
existing data source methods



00:25:00.786 --> 00:25:03.086 A:middle
and replace them with slightly
more sophisticated ones,

00:25:03.086 --> 00:25:04.716 A:middle
that understand how to
deal with sectioning.

00:25:05.286 --> 00:25:07.856 A:middle
Here they are.

00:25:08.236 --> 00:25:09.466 A:middle
We'll go through them briefly.

00:25:10.026 --> 00:25:12.216 A:middle
Now we need to be able to tell
the CollectionView how many

00:25:12.216 --> 00:25:14.106 A:middle
sections there are in it.

00:25:14.396 --> 00:25:16.566 A:middle
If our GroupByTag
check box is checked,

00:25:16.566 --> 00:25:18.066 A:middle
which with will set
the property,

00:25:18.346 --> 00:25:21.116 A:middle
we just return the count
of the number of tags

00:25:21.146 --> 00:25:22.116 A:middle
in the image collection.

00:25:22.466 --> 00:25:23.576 A:middle
Plus one because we want

00:25:23.576 --> 00:25:26.976 A:middle
that extra untagged
ImageFiles collection section,

00:25:26.976 --> 00:25:28.006 A:middle
sorry, at the end.

00:25:29.256 --> 00:25:29.826 A:middle
Simple enough.

00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:33.656 A:middle
Reporting the number
much items in a section,

00:25:33.786 --> 00:25:36.206 A:middle
again it is a little different
if we're grouping by tag,

00:25:36.516 --> 00:25:39.766 A:middle
basically we want to say if
the section corresponds to one

00:25:39.766 --> 00:25:41.996 A:middle
of our tags in our collection,
we'll return the count

00:25:41.996 --> 00:25:44.296 A:middle
of the number of
ImageFiles in the tag

00:25:44.296 --> 00:25:45.816 A:middle
that corresponds
to that section.

00:25:46.586 --> 00:25:49.066 A:middle
If we're in the special
untagged ImageFile section

00:25:49.066 --> 00:25:50.266 A:middle
at the end we'll
return the count

00:25:50.266 --> 00:25:51.816 A:middle
of untagged ImageFiles,
and so on.

00:25:51.816 --> 00:25:53.146 A:middle
It's pretty straightforward.

00:25:54.726 --> 00:25:57.126 A:middle
We'll look at Item

00:25:57.126 --> 00:26:01.266 A:middle
For Represented Object
At Index Path.



00:25:57.126 --> 00:26:01.266 A:middle
For Represented Object
At Index Path.

00:26:01.266 --> 00:26:04.046 A:middle
This is the same implementation
as before, it is able to be

00:26:04.046 --> 00:26:07.916 A:middle
because I factored out this
ImageFile At Index Path method

00:26:08.106 --> 00:26:11.866 A:middle
for my own use which, actually,
this one is not suitable

00:26:11.866 --> 00:26:15.976 A:middle
because it looks at the item
index and not the section index.

00:26:15.976 --> 00:26:17.986 A:middle
We'll replace it with
a smarter version

00:26:19.426 --> 00:26:27.776 A:middle
that knows we might
want to group by tag.

00:26:27.876 --> 00:26:31.566 A:middle
If we're grouping by tag, again,
if the section corresponds

00:26:31.566 --> 00:26:35.876 A:middle
to one of our tags, we'll
find the ImageFile in the list

00:26:35.876 --> 00:26:39.016 A:middle
of ImageFiles for that tag,
according to the item index,

00:26:39.606 --> 00:26:42.156 A:middle
and the section index that tells
us which tag we're dealing with.

00:26:43.076 --> 00:26:45.596 A:middle
Let's try building
and running now.

00:26:46.196 --> 00:26:49.106 A:middle
We can check group by tag here

00:26:49.686 --> 00:26:52.046 A:middle
and now we have our
items grouped by tag

00:26:53.126 --> 00:26:56.436 A:middle
and we get the same flow
and re-layout as before,

00:26:56.486 --> 00:26:58.046 A:middle
and if we zoom in we can see.

00:26:58.116 --> 00:27:01.186 A:middle
This is our header view
which we defined in a nib,



00:26:58.116 --> 00:27:01.186 A:middle
This is our header view
which we defined in a nib,

00:27:01.186 --> 00:27:04.076 A:middle
it is basically a container,
gives us a light gray background

00:27:04.076 --> 00:27:06.076 A:middle
and has a text field,
you can put any kind

00:27:06.076 --> 00:27:08.476 A:middle
of controls you want
in here in these,

00:27:08.856 --> 00:27:11.366 A:middle
this is our footer view here,
this is sort of a darker gray,

00:27:11.576 --> 00:27:13.566 A:middle
telling us - we have
put a text field

00:27:13.566 --> 00:27:15.766 A:middle
in telling us how many
ImageFiles are in the group.

00:27:16.306 --> 00:27:18.386 A:middle
That's really all it takes
to implement sections,

00:27:18.436 --> 00:27:20.686 A:middle
it is basically the
same as on iOS.

00:27:21.356 --> 00:27:24.426 A:middle
the one thing that I elided
here, oh, two things I elided,

00:27:25.076 --> 00:27:28.846 A:middle
are the creation of the
supplementary views, the.

00:27:28.846 --> 00:27:30.986 A:middle
headers or footers, there
is a bit of code here,

00:27:30.986 --> 00:27:33.146 A:middle
but basically it is
really very parallel.

00:27:33.376 --> 00:27:35.406 A:middle
The main point of interest
is where we call back

00:27:35.406 --> 00:27:38.526 A:middle
to the CollectionView and say,
make Supplementary Element View,

00:27:38.816 --> 00:27:41.466 A:middle
sorry, Make Supplementary
Element View of kind,

00:27:41.496 --> 00:27:42.896 A:middle
the Flow layout defines,

00:27:43.146 --> 00:27:45.486 A:middle
are section header,
and section footer.

00:27:45.486 --> 00:27:46.866 A:middle
It will be one of those.

00:27:47.196 --> 00:27:49.326 A:middle
We know when it is
section header we'll look

00:27:49.326 --> 00:27:50.846 A:middle
for header.nib, we're
going to look

00:27:50.846 --> 00:27:52.256 A:middle
for footer.nib if
it is the footer.

00:27:52.626 --> 00:27:54.396 A:middle
We pass that in as
an identifier.

00:27:54.826 --> 00:27:57.206 A:middle
Once we've got our view,
we're getting a view,

00:27:57.206 --> 00:27:58.706 A:middle
and not a ViewController
this time.



00:28:00.206 --> 00:28:03.376 A:middle
We can find and set up
the value for TextField,

00:28:03.376 --> 00:28:05.846 A:middle
do whatever we want, and return
it back to the CollectionView.

00:28:06.276 --> 00:28:08.686 A:middle
Last thing we need to do is
implement these delegate methods

00:28:08.686 --> 00:28:12.106 A:middle
the Layout uses to figure
out what's the proper size,

00:28:12.366 --> 00:28:15.216 A:middle
basically the height to display
the header at, and the height

00:28:15.246 --> 00:28:16.236 A:middle
to display the footer at.

00:28:16.236 --> 00:28:18.216 A:middle
We have NSIs in each case,

00:28:18.936 --> 00:28:21.216 A:middle
and since we have a
vertically-scrolling flow

00:28:21.216 --> 00:28:24.176 A:middle
layout, only the height matters,
the width will just get clipped

00:28:24.176 --> 00:28:25.996 A:middle
to the width of the scroll view.

00:28:27.036 --> 00:28:29.436 A:middle
We had to do that to
make sure that ourheaders

00:28:29.476 --> 00:28:30.946 A:middle
and footers showed up.

00:28:31.626 --> 00:28:32.146 A:middle
That's it.

00:28:34.306 --> 00:28:36.766 A:middle
Now we can move on to updating
when our model changes.

00:28:37.076 --> 00:28:40.066 A:middle
So ImageFiles will come
and go in the folder,

00:28:40.226 --> 00:28:41.636 A:middle
we need to tell the
CollectionView

00:28:41.636 --> 00:28:44.376 A:middle
when our model changes so that
we can update what it is showing

00:28:44.376 --> 00:28:44.846 A:middle
the user.

00:28:45.956 --> 00:28:49.116 A:middle
This is done very similarly to
the way that this is handled

00:28:49.516 --> 00:28:52.816 A:middle
with Outline View on OS X.

00:28:52.816 --> 00:28:54.956 A:middle
Basically, these are
the four operations:

00:28:55.296 --> 00:28:59.236 A:middle
Items can be inserted,
deleted, an item can be moved

00:28:59.236 --> 00:29:01.746 A:middle
from one place to another,
or an item can be reloaded



00:28:59.236 --> 00:29:01.746 A:middle
from one place to another,
or an item can be reloaded

00:29:01.746 --> 00:29:03.526 A:middle
which basically means
it is still there

00:29:03.526 --> 00:29:06.676 A:middle
but the properties have changed,
you need to redisplay it,

00:29:06.676 --> 00:29:09.176 A:middle
you need to regather
properties from it.

00:29:09.446 --> 00:29:11.156 A:middle
It turns out that
these operations apply

00:29:11.156 --> 00:29:12.676 A:middle
to sections as well as items.

00:29:12.676 --> 00:29:15.256 A:middle
This is the same as on iOS
for those who are familiar.

00:29:15.676 --> 00:29:18.956 A:middle
You can insert, delete, move,
and reload sections as well.

00:29:20.796 --> 00:29:23.636 A:middle
Similar approach to view-based
outline view as I mentioned,

00:29:23.636 --> 00:29:26.146 A:middle
which basically means any
time the model changes,

00:29:26.356 --> 00:29:29.306 A:middle
it is the responsibility of your
data source or some other part

00:29:29.306 --> 00:29:30.696 A:middle
of your code that
deals with the model,

00:29:30.906 --> 00:29:32.306 A:middle
to notify the CollectionView,

00:29:32.566 --> 00:29:35.126 A:middle
describing exactly the
changes that were made.

00:29:35.126 --> 00:29:37.806 A:middle
I inserted items at
these index paths.

00:29:37.806 --> 00:29:40.836 A:middle
I removed items here, so
that it can will keep up,

00:29:40.836 --> 00:29:42.046 A:middle
staying in sync with the model.

00:29:42.606 --> 00:29:44.066 A:middle
If you do it right,
it is very simple.

00:29:45.426 --> 00:29:48.146 A:middle
By default, any changes you
notify the CollectionView of,

00:29:48.196 --> 00:29:50.916 A:middle
will appear instantly but you
can easily get an animated

00:29:50.916 --> 00:29:53.796 A:middle
change, by messaging through
the CollectionView's animator,

00:29:53.796 --> 00:29:56.636 A:middle
this is a general proxy
object that views have,

00:29:56.836 --> 00:29:59.676 A:middle
that you can message through,
to request an animated change,

00:29:59.676 --> 00:30:01.856 A:middle
usually when setting a
property in this case



00:29:59.676 --> 00:30:01.856 A:middle
usually when setting a
property in this case

00:30:02.116 --> 00:30:03.446 A:middle
when notifying the
CollectionView

00:30:03.786 --> 00:30:05.006 A:middle
that items have been inserted.

00:30:05.416 --> 00:30:08.066 A:middle
That's what we do in our example
and that's why we see items come

00:30:08.066 --> 00:30:09.356 A:middle
and go in animated way.

00:30:09.356 --> 00:30:12.126 A:middle
Items are inserted, other
items move out of the way

00:30:12.536 --> 00:30:13.566 A:middle
in an animated fashion.

00:30:14.126 --> 00:30:16.696 A:middle
In our example,
CocoaSlideCollection we're going

00:30:16.696 --> 00:30:18.836 A:middle
to watch our ImageFolder
for changes,

00:30:19.606 --> 00:30:21.806 A:middle
when changes occur
we're going to notify--

00:30:21.976 --> 00:30:23.336 A:middle
first we immediate
to update the model

00:30:23.336 --> 00:30:24.776 A:middle
and then we notify
the CollectionView,

00:30:24.776 --> 00:30:27.306 A:middle
after we changed the model,
what we did to the model.

00:30:28.806 --> 00:30:32.966 A:middle
ImageFiles may come and
go, they may be changed,

00:30:33.176 --> 00:30:35.326 A:middle
these are the types of updates
that we'll need to handle.

00:30:35.326 --> 00:30:38.216 A:middle
We are going to use
a little feature,

00:30:38.256 --> 00:30:40.336 A:middle
a foundation feature
called Key-ValueObserving,

00:30:40.336 --> 00:30:43.046 A:middle
which basically gives you
a way to observe properties

00:30:43.046 --> 00:30:45.796 A:middle
of objects, and be
notified automatically,

00:30:45.956 --> 00:30:48.576 A:middle
so that you can then react
in whatever way you need to,

00:30:48.626 --> 00:30:51.536 A:middle
our example uses KVO
throughout for this.

00:30:51.536 --> 00:30:53.776 A:middle
Let's go back to the
demo machine real quick.

00:30:54.546 --> 00:30:56.876 A:middle
I have this already
working here.

00:30:58.466 --> 00:31:01.426 A:middle
We'll run our example
first, to see what it does.



00:30:58.466 --> 00:31:01.426 A:middle
We'll run our example
first, to see what it does.

00:31:01.976 --> 00:31:04.406 A:middle
Instead of looking at the
desktop pictures folder,

00:31:04.916 --> 00:31:09.276 A:middle
I'm going to open this vacation
pictures folder, on my desktop.

00:31:09.886 --> 00:31:14.836 A:middle
Let's suppose that I have taken
some pictures on vacation,

00:31:16.076 --> 00:31:17.176 A:middle
gone to some neat places.

00:31:17.286 --> 00:31:20.016 A:middle
I have Finder windows
down here at the bottom,

00:31:20.526 --> 00:31:22.716 A:middle
pointing to desktop pictures,
I'm going to copy some stuff

00:31:22.716 --> 00:31:23.776 A:middle
from desktop pictures,

00:31:23.776 --> 00:31:26.786 A:middle
pretending I went
to these places.

00:31:26.836 --> 00:31:30.636 A:middle
I'll drag and drop some
items into the folder.

00:31:31.326 --> 00:31:33.456 A:middle
CocoaSlideCollection is
monitoring the folder,

00:31:33.456 --> 00:31:37.786 A:middle
it will notice the change,
and add items to its model,

00:31:37.786 --> 00:31:39.936 A:middle
add ImageFile instances,
and then it's going

00:31:39.936 --> 00:31:41.366 A:middle
to notify the CollectionView,
okay,

00:31:41.596 --> 00:31:44.376 A:middle
some ImageFiles were added,
so display some more items

00:31:44.376 --> 00:31:47.236 A:middle
and that happens in a very
synchronized, animated way.

00:31:47.576 --> 00:31:51.406 A:middle
We can drag an item out, a file
out, and, when it disappears,

00:31:51.406 --> 00:31:54.566 A:middle
do an updated File system
scan, notice the change,

00:31:54.566 --> 00:31:56.076 A:middle
update our model, and
the CollectionView

00:31:56.076 --> 00:31:56.936 A:middle
updates accordingly.

00:31:57.596 --> 00:32:01.116 A:middle
The KVO mechanics of
this are pretty standard,



00:31:57.596 --> 00:32:01.116 A:middle
The KVO mechanics of
this are pretty standard,

00:32:01.116 --> 00:32:01.646 A:middle
run of the mill.

00:32:01.886 --> 00:32:04.406 A:middle
The interesting, part is how
you talk to the CollectionView.

00:32:04.986 --> 00:32:07.186 A:middle
So, we'll elide the former, and
we'll just look at the latter.

00:32:07.186 --> 00:32:10.146 A:middle
You want to look at these
methods at the bottom

00:32:10.146 --> 00:32:13.586 A:middle
of the Window Controller class,
Handle Image Files Inserted

00:32:13.616 --> 00:32:15.286 A:middle
At Index Paths, that's
just something we defined

00:32:15.286 --> 00:32:16.936 A:middle
for our own use, and
this is where we talk

00:32:16.936 --> 00:32:20.376 A:middle
to the image CollectionView
and use this Insert Items

00:32:20.416 --> 00:32:22.796 A:middle
at Index Paths API,
basically what we have had

00:32:22.796 --> 00:32:24.996 A:middle
to do is figure out, OK, what
are the index paths of the items

00:32:24.996 --> 00:32:25.986 A:middle
that are affected by this?

00:32:25.986 --> 00:32:27.066 A:middle
Where did we insert items?

00:32:27.496 --> 00:32:29.896 A:middle
We messaged the CollectionView,
and since we're messaging

00:32:29.896 --> 00:32:31.576 A:middle
through the animator, we'll
get an animated change,

00:32:31.576 --> 00:32:33.166 A:middle
where the re-layout
that needs to happen,

00:32:33.446 --> 00:32:35.776 A:middle
happens in a smooth way,
instead of instantaneously.

00:32:35.956 --> 00:32:38.376 A:middle
You can make it instantaneous
if you want, by omitting this.

00:32:38.776 --> 00:32:40.536 A:middle
If you want an animated
response,

00:32:40.536 --> 00:32:41.706 A:middle
message through the animator,

00:32:41.746 --> 00:32:43.596 A:middle
you can even control
the duration

00:32:43.596 --> 00:32:45.986 A:middle
by setting the animation
context duration.

00:32:46.976 --> 00:32:49.246 A:middle
Similar thing for
when ImageFiles go,

00:32:49.246 --> 00:32:52.006 A:middle
use Delete Items At Index Paths.

00:32:53.056 --> 00:32:56.756 A:middle
Then there are even sections,
InsertSections, DeleteSections,

00:32:56.756 --> 00:32:57.796 A:middle
and other related APIs,

00:32:57.796 --> 00:32:59.396 A:middle
for dealing with
sections coming and going.

00:32:59.506 --> 00:33:01.926 A:middle
We're even equipped to handle
the new tags being added



00:32:59.506 --> 00:33:01.926 A:middle
We're even equipped to handle
the new tags being added

00:33:01.926 --> 00:33:03.036 A:middle
and tags being removed.

00:33:04.726 --> 00:33:06.646 A:middle
That's pretty much
all there is to it.

00:33:09.156 --> 00:33:11.176 A:middle
So selection and
highlighting are important

00:33:11.176 --> 00:33:12.356 A:middle
when interacting with users.

00:33:12.356 --> 00:33:13.766 A:middle
We'll look at those
in some detail.

00:33:15.396 --> 00:33:16.236 A:middle
Basically selection

00:33:16.236 --> 00:33:18.876 A:middle
and highlighting are both
visually indicated states.

00:33:19.126 --> 00:33:22.036 A:middle
Highlighting in particular
is sort of a transient state

00:33:22.036 --> 00:33:25.446 A:middle
on the way to items becoming
selected, or deselected,

00:33:25.656 --> 00:33:27.126 A:middle
or used as a drop target.

00:33:29.236 --> 00:33:31.896 A:middle
Here in this illustration
we have items

00:33:31.896 --> 00:33:34.706 A:middle
that were briefly flashed orange
as I was dragging over them,

00:33:34.706 --> 00:33:36.706 A:middle
they were candidates for
selection, we're indicating

00:33:36.706 --> 00:33:39.156 A:middle
that with the orange border,
but then they become blue

00:33:39.416 --> 00:33:41.646 A:middle
when they become selected,
rather than highlighted.

00:33:44.456 --> 00:33:47.416 A:middle
So on OS X an item
has a highlightState.

00:33:47.416 --> 00:33:48.886 A:middle
This is a little
different than on iOS,

00:33:48.886 --> 00:33:50.716 A:middle
there is a just a Boolean
highlight property,

00:33:50.956 --> 00:33:53.636 A:middle
we needed a bit more flexibility
on the desktop to be able

00:33:53.636 --> 00:33:55.246 A:middle
to describe different
kinds of states.

00:33:55.616 --> 00:34:00.356 A:middle
The highlightState has
four possible values.



00:33:55.616 --> 00:34:00.356 A:middle
The highlightState has
four possible values.

00:34:00.956 --> 00:34:04.226 A:middle
The default is none, basically
means don't highlight this item.

00:34:04.316 --> 00:34:06.456 A:middle
You'll want to look at whether
the item is selected or not,

00:34:06.456 --> 00:34:07.926 A:middle
to decide how to present it.

00:34:08.565 --> 00:34:09.985 A:middle
If it is not selected
or highlighted,

00:34:10.206 --> 00:34:11.255 A:middle
you may display it normally.

00:34:12.476 --> 00:34:13.916 A:middle
an item may be highlighted

00:34:13.916 --> 00:34:16.206 A:middle
for selection meaning it
is not currently selected,

00:34:16.206 --> 00:34:18.335 A:middle
but we're considering
selecting it, based on something

00:34:18.335 --> 00:34:20.696 A:middle
that the user is doing, such
as dragging across items.

00:34:20.985 --> 00:34:22.626 A:middle
Then you may want to
present it with some kind

00:34:22.626 --> 00:34:25.806 A:middle
of highlight indication, this is
entirely up to you how you want

00:34:25.806 --> 00:34:29.166 A:middle
to design this in your UI,
we're using an orange border

00:34:29.166 --> 00:34:30.896 A:middle
around the slide to
show it is highlighted

00:34:30.896 --> 00:34:32.556 A:middle
for selection, but
not yet selected.

00:34:33.846 --> 00:34:36.616 A:middle
An item can also be
highlighted for deselection.

00:34:37.005 --> 00:34:40.846 A:middle
This is possible with the shift
drag behavior that's the same

00:34:40.846 --> 00:34:42.525 A:middle
as in Finder icon views.

00:34:43.775 --> 00:34:48.315 A:middle
Basically the trick here is the
item is selected, but you want

00:34:48.315 --> 00:34:50.426 A:middle
to suppress showing the
usual selected appearance.

00:34:50.426 --> 00:34:51.525 A:middle
You want to show
something different,

00:34:51.525 --> 00:34:54.176 A:middle
to indicate to the user
that the item was selected,

00:34:54.176 --> 00:34:56.216 A:middle
but we're looking at
making it deselected now.

00:34:56.306 --> 00:34:58.016 A:middle
You might want to show it
normally, this is really

00:34:58.016 --> 00:35:01.386 A:middle
up to you what you want to do,
according to your new iDesign.



00:34:58.016 --> 00:35:01.386 A:middle
up to you what you want to do,
according to your new iDesign.

00:35:01.866 --> 00:35:03.586 A:middle
Lastly, an item can
be highlighted

00:35:03.996 --> 00:35:05.976 A:middle
to indicate it is a
potential Drop Target

00:35:05.976 --> 00:35:08.676 A:middle
which doesn't make a lot of
sense in our example today,

00:35:08.676 --> 00:35:10.576 A:middle
because a slide is
the leaf node,

00:35:10.576 --> 00:35:11.756 A:middle
we don't really have a semantic

00:35:11.756 --> 00:35:14.116 A:middle
for dropping slides
onto another slide.

00:35:14.276 --> 00:35:16.276 A:middle
But, if we had something
that was more of a container,

00:35:16.476 --> 00:35:18.166 A:middle
it might make sense, and
we'd want to indicate

00:35:18.166 --> 00:35:21.356 A:middle
that that container is where
things are going to get dropped

00:35:21.356 --> 00:35:23.436 A:middle
if the user lets the mouse
up at that current point.

00:35:23.926 --> 00:35:27.146 A:middle
Those are the different
highlight states.

00:35:27.356 --> 00:35:29.116 A:middle
One handy thing to
remember, as I said,

00:35:29.116 --> 00:35:30.436 A:middle
everything is layer-backed now,

00:35:30.436 --> 00:35:32.796 A:middle
with the new CollectionView
implementation.

00:35:33.466 --> 00:35:36.506 A:middle
That gives you the
opportunity to take advantage

00:35:36.556 --> 00:35:39.706 A:middle
of backing-layer
properties as an easy way

00:35:39.706 --> 00:35:40.886 A:middle
to change the appearance
of an item

00:35:40.886 --> 00:35:42.046 A:middle
without having to do redraw.

00:35:42.416 --> 00:35:45.456 A:middle
So, CN layer properties such as
background color, border color,

00:35:45.456 --> 00:35:47.116 A:middle
border width, corner radius,
you've probably worked

00:35:47.116 --> 00:35:49.146 A:middle
with these before, are
real handy for this.

00:35:49.456 --> 00:35:53.666 A:middle
So we might set an item's root
views layer's background color

00:35:53.666 --> 00:35:56.496 A:middle
to some color, and then give
it a corner radius, and boom,

00:35:56.496 --> 00:35:59.496 A:middle
in two lines of code we've got
a quick highlight indication

00:35:59.496 --> 00:36:01.526 A:middle
or selection indication,
nice and easy.



00:35:59.496 --> 00:36:01.526 A:middle
or selection indication,
nice and easy.

00:36:01.526 --> 00:36:03.876 A:middle
You don't have to
do it that way.

00:36:03.876 --> 00:36:05.276 A:middle
That's just optional,
something to keep

00:36:05.276 --> 00:36:06.996 A:middle
in mind now they're we're
in a layer-backed world.

00:36:07.846 --> 00:36:09.496 A:middle
When to apply highlighting?

00:36:09.836 --> 00:36:10.496 A:middle
Real simple.

00:36:10.546 --> 00:36:12.766 A:middle
Any time your item's
highlightState changes,

00:36:12.986 --> 00:36:16.166 A:middle
in Swift you can do that, in
a DidSetObserver clause here,

00:36:16.766 --> 00:36:19.696 A:middle
you will also want to
do the same for watching

00:36:19.696 --> 00:36:23.076 A:middle
when the items selected state,
the Boolean, changes to yes

00:36:23.076 --> 00:36:24.996 A:middle
or no, you want to take
the highlightState,

00:36:24.996 --> 00:36:26.976 A:middle
and the selected state,
into account together,

00:36:27.196 --> 00:36:29.786 A:middle
and decide visually how to
present that item to indicate

00:36:29.786 --> 00:36:31.266 A:middle
that according to your UI style.

00:36:33.176 --> 00:36:35.296 A:middle
Selection of course is
what we're working toward,

00:36:35.296 --> 00:36:37.086 A:middle
we want users to be
able to select items

00:36:37.086 --> 00:36:39.896 A:middle
so that they can then
operate on them by dragging,

00:36:39.896 --> 00:36:41.106 A:middle
or with menu commands.

00:36:42.056 --> 00:36:43.996 A:middle
With a CollectionView,
items are the things

00:36:43.996 --> 00:36:45.226 A:middle
that constitute the selection,

00:36:45.226 --> 00:36:46.416 A:middle
they're what can
become selected.

00:36:46.906 --> 00:36:49.696 A:middle
NSCollectionView supports single

00:36:49.696 --> 00:36:51.336 A:middle
or multiple selection,
as before.

00:36:51.616 --> 00:36:54.186 A:middle
The master switch is whether
it is selectable or not.

00:36:55.306 --> 00:36:56.406 A:middle
If you make it selectable,

00:36:56.406 --> 00:36:58.086 A:middle
you can make it allow
multiple selection,

00:36:58.086 --> 00:37:00.776 A:middle
or force just single
selection, or no selection,



00:36:58.086 --> 00:37:00.776 A:middle
or force just single
selection, or no selection,

00:37:00.776 --> 00:37:02.296 A:middle
and you can deny the ability

00:37:02.296 --> 00:37:04.756 A:middle
to have an empty selection
making the CollectionView try

00:37:04.756 --> 00:37:07.146 A:middle
to always maintain at
least one item selected.

00:37:07.276 --> 00:37:09.876 A:middle
These are pretty standard,
they are common to other types

00:37:09.876 --> 00:37:12.126 A:middle
of AppKit CollectionViews
and controls

00:37:12.906 --> 00:37:14.866 A:middle
such as Table View,
Outline View.

00:37:16.136 --> 00:37:19.436 A:middle
Selection is tracked by the new
Selection Index Path Property

00:37:19.436 --> 00:37:20.666 A:middle
on NSCollectionView.

00:37:20.666 --> 00:37:22.656 A:middle
That's the authoritative
representation

00:37:22.656 --> 00:37:24.206 A:middle
of what's selected in
the CollectionView,

00:37:24.206 --> 00:37:26.166 A:middle
and we are using index paths
rather than the items, right?

00:37:26.166 --> 00:37:28.936 A:middle
Because items come and go, but
the index paths stick around.

00:37:29.326 --> 00:37:31.646 A:middle
An item, if it happens
to be instantiated,

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:33.706 A:middle
does know whether it is
part of the selection

00:37:33.706 --> 00:37:36.436 A:middle
as I have mentioned, but
again, items come and go.

00:37:36.436 --> 00:37:39.226 A:middle
CollectionViews are forever,
so usually you want to look

00:37:39.226 --> 00:37:41.126 A:middle
at the SelectionIndexPaths
at the CollectionView,

00:37:41.466 --> 00:37:44.306 A:middle
to do your operations, and there
are Select Items At Index Paths,

00:37:44.706 --> 00:37:47.396 A:middle
and Deselect Items At Index
Paths, methods that you can use,

00:37:47.396 --> 00:37:49.856 A:middle
you can also just set
selection index paths directly.

00:37:50.406 --> 00:37:52.836 A:middle
When you select items at
index paths as on iOS,

00:37:52.836 --> 00:37:54.076 A:middle
you can also ask
the CollectionView

00:37:54.276 --> 00:37:57.336 A:middle
to scroll those items into view
with a particular alignment.

00:37:57.666 --> 00:37:58.486 A:middle
If you want.

00:37:59.906 --> 00:38:02.026 A:middle
User selection is what
we're usually dealing with.



00:37:59.906 --> 00:38:02.026 A:middle
User selection is what
we're usually dealing with.

00:38:02.926 --> 00:38:05.666 A:middle
The delegate has the
opportunity as on iOS

00:38:05.666 --> 00:38:07.146 A:middle
to approve selection
and deselection.

00:38:07.146 --> 00:38:10.496 A:middle
We made the API a little
different, because again we want

00:38:10.496 --> 00:38:12.716 A:middle
to be able to handle
bulk operations a little

00:38:12.716 --> 00:38:13.446 A:middle
more efficiently.

00:38:13.706 --> 00:38:15.886 A:middle
Now we have CollectionView,
Should Select Items

00:38:15.886 --> 00:38:17.636 A:middle
At Index Paths, and
CollectionView,

00:38:17.636 --> 00:38:19.496 A:middle
Should Deselect Items
At Index Paths.

00:38:19.776 --> 00:38:22.146 A:middle
Each of which takes a set of
index paths as the parameter.

00:38:22.146 --> 00:38:24.416 A:middle
These are the proposed
index paths we are going

00:38:24.416 --> 00:38:26.256 A:middle
to to select or deselect.

00:38:26.256 --> 00:38:27.796 A:middle
Notice that, instead
of returning a Boolean,

00:38:27.796 --> 00:38:30.646 A:middle
these return also, a
set of index paths.

00:38:30.816 --> 00:38:32.656 A:middle
So, if you just want to
say, do whatever you want,

00:38:32.656 --> 00:38:35.176 A:middle
CollectionView, just return the
set of index paths we gave you,

00:38:35.396 --> 00:38:36.936 A:middle
but you also have
the opportunity here,

00:38:37.236 --> 00:38:39.426 A:middle
to return a different
set of index paths,

00:38:39.426 --> 00:38:41.796 A:middle
you can do a line item
detail here if you want,

00:38:42.016 --> 00:38:43.596 A:middle
based on whatever
criteria you want,

00:38:43.596 --> 00:38:46.856 A:middle
you have fine-grain control over
which items can become selected

00:38:46.856 --> 00:38:48.576 A:middle
or deselected in
certain situations.

00:38:48.936 --> 00:38:52.606 A:middle
There are also DidSelect and
DidDeselect delegate methods,

00:38:52.896 --> 00:38:54.546 A:middle
so you can find out
after the fact

00:38:54.546 --> 00:38:56.036 A:middle
when the selection
change has been committed.

00:38:57.206 --> 00:39:00.006 A:middle
Similarly for highlighting,
the delegate has methods



00:38:57.206 --> 00:39:00.006 A:middle
Similarly for highlighting,
the delegate has methods

00:39:00.656 --> 00:39:03.726 A:middle
for approving and
reacting to these changes.

00:39:03.726 --> 00:39:06.496 A:middle
So, Should Change Items At Index
Paths to highlightState, again,

00:39:06.496 --> 00:39:08.916 A:middle
you can return a different
set of index paths,

00:39:09.056 --> 00:39:10.336 A:middle
you have fine-grain control

00:39:10.576 --> 00:39:12.436 A:middle
over highlighting behavior
with your delegate.

00:39:12.436 --> 00:39:16.656 A:middle
We'll look at this real quickly
again on the demo machine.

00:39:21.456 --> 00:39:22.576 A:middle
Fortunately, for time's sake,

00:39:22.576 --> 00:39:23.846 A:middle
I have the code all
written and running.

00:39:23.846 --> 00:39:25.386 A:middle
We just want to go
into our nib file,

00:39:26.616 --> 00:39:28.636 A:middle
and drill down to our
CollectionView here.

00:39:36.316 --> 00:39:39.736 A:middle
We'll make sure that it
is marked as selectable,

00:39:39.736 --> 00:39:41.156 A:middle
we'll allow empty selection,

00:39:41.156 --> 00:39:43.586 A:middle
and we'll allow multiple
selection too.

00:39:44.386 --> 00:39:46.696 A:middle
The rest of the implementation
is pretty straightforward,

00:39:46.696 --> 00:39:49.526 A:middle
based on the understanding
that we now have.

00:39:50.316 --> 00:39:51.966 A:middle
We'll stop, build, and run.

00:39:56.216 --> 00:39:58.906 A:middle
Now we can click on
items and select them.

00:39:58.906 --> 00:40:02.576 A:middle
We have chosen, for illustration
purposes, to show items



00:39:58.906 --> 00:40:02.576 A:middle
We have chosen, for illustration
purposes, to show items

00:40:02.576 --> 00:40:04.296 A:middle
that are candidates
for selection.

00:40:04.296 --> 00:40:06.876 A:middle
They're highlighted in orange
before they become selected,

00:40:06.876 --> 00:40:10.206 A:middle
when I let up on the Trackpad,
it becomes blue, it's selected,

00:40:10.206 --> 00:40:12.856 A:middle
and no longer highlighted, we
can click in the background

00:40:13.016 --> 00:40:15.946 A:middle
to clear the selection, I can
click and drag across items,

00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:18.636 A:middle
again we are showing items as
highlighted to become selected,

00:40:18.636 --> 00:40:21.426 A:middle
they're not selected yet, but
when I let up on the Trackpad,

00:40:21.666 --> 00:40:24.026 A:middle
they cease to be highlighted,
now they're selected.

00:40:24.636 --> 00:40:28.026 A:middle
As I mentioned as in
the Finder icon view,

00:40:28.026 --> 00:40:30.126 A:middle
if you hold down shift, and
drag-select you actually end

00:40:30.126 --> 00:40:31.486 A:middle
up sort of inverting
the selection.

00:40:31.486 --> 00:40:33.956 A:middle
Here is an example of
items that were selected,

00:40:34.326 --> 00:40:36.726 A:middle
that become highlighted
for deselection.

00:40:37.076 --> 00:40:38.296 A:middle
So, even though they're
selected,

00:40:38.296 --> 00:40:40.546 A:middle
we're letting the
highlightState override that,

00:40:40.546 --> 00:40:41.886 A:middle
and how we visually
present them,

00:40:41.886 --> 00:40:44.656 A:middle
and we're just showing them
in an ordinary fashion,

00:40:44.656 --> 00:40:45.846 A:middle
with no border around them.

00:40:45.846 --> 00:40:48.356 A:middle
Then, when I let go, the
selection is committed.

00:40:48.766 --> 00:40:51.966 A:middle
Now, since I can select, I can
Drag-and-Drop things around,

00:40:51.966 --> 00:40:53.746 A:middle
reorder them which is nice.

00:40:54.236 --> 00:40:55.666 A:middle
Once you have selection
there is a lot

00:40:55.666 --> 00:40:58.496 A:middle
of neat stuff that you can do.

00:40:59.146 --> 00:41:00.536 A:middle
Since this is all implemented



00:40:59.146 --> 00:41:00.536 A:middle
Since this is all implemented

00:41:00.536 --> 00:41:03.366 A:middle
in a very generalized way that's
agnostic in different layouts,

00:41:03.366 --> 00:41:04.896 A:middle
we can go look at
our custom layouts,

00:41:05.216 --> 00:41:07.056 A:middle
since they implement
the required methods,

00:41:07.496 --> 00:41:11.026 A:middle
we can also drag-select across
items in our custom layouts,

00:41:11.056 --> 00:41:13.846 A:middle
click select, and that
happens automatically,

00:41:13.846 --> 00:41:14.696 A:middle
because they conform

00:41:14.696 --> 00:41:17.886 A:middle
to the standard NSCollectionView
Layout API.

00:41:18.736 --> 00:41:20.646 A:middle
That's kind of a nice
thing to get for free.

00:41:20.646 --> 00:41:22.376 A:middle
Even when we're in
section mode here,

00:41:22.946 --> 00:41:27.166 A:middle
Flow layout lets us drag-select
across sections, and so forth.

00:41:27.426 --> 00:41:28.866 A:middle
That's kind of neat.

00:41:29.816 --> 00:41:30.736 A:middle
It just works.

00:41:31.496 --> 00:41:35.966 A:middle
Two more things to talk about.

00:41:35.966 --> 00:41:38.266 A:middle
We'll talk real quick
about Drag-and-Drop,

00:41:38.956 --> 00:41:40.006 A:middle
which is important to support.

00:41:40.006 --> 00:41:41.606 A:middle
It hasn't fundamentally changed

00:41:41.606 --> 00:41:42.866 A:middle
since the old CollectionView
API,

00:41:42.866 --> 00:41:44.626 A:middle
but there are some new
things to understand.

00:41:45.156 --> 00:41:50.326 A:middle
We can drag-select items now,
and then if you have a cluster

00:41:50.326 --> 00:41:51.676 A:middle
of items selected,
or just a single,

00:41:51.676 --> 00:41:53.596 A:middle
you can drag it, move it around.

00:41:54.506 --> 00:41:56.186 A:middle
The CollectionView,
as you're dragging,

00:41:56.816 --> 00:41:59.546 A:middle
computes candidate
targets for where to drop.

00:41:59.546 --> 00:42:01.836 A:middle
In the case of this example,
we're not allowing dropping



00:41:59.546 --> 00:42:01.836 A:middle
In the case of this example,
we're not allowing dropping

00:42:01.836 --> 00:42:03.716 A:middle
on items because they
don't represent containers,

00:42:03.716 --> 00:42:05.796 A:middle
but we are allowing
dropping between items,

00:42:05.796 --> 00:42:07.486 A:middle
which is the new thing that
we have to be concerned

00:42:07.486 --> 00:42:09.126 A:middle
with on OS X and not on iOS.

00:42:11.066 --> 00:42:13.576 A:middle
So drag and drop, as before,

00:42:13.576 --> 00:42:15.956 A:middle
is handled by the
NSCollectionView's delegate,

00:42:15.956 --> 00:42:18.226 A:middle
it's responsible for your
drag-and-drop response.

00:42:18.806 --> 00:42:22.356 A:middle
The model is intentionally very
similar to NSOutlineView's API,

00:42:22.356 --> 00:42:25.476 A:middle
there is no fundamental reason
for it to be very different.

00:42:25.476 --> 00:42:28.106 A:middle
If you've seen the drag-and-drop
outline view example,

00:42:28.106 --> 00:42:30.726 A:middle
a lot of the same concepts that
you'll see implemented there,

00:42:31.196 --> 00:42:33.776 A:middle
[it's] basically the same
idea with NSCollectionView.

00:42:34.806 --> 00:42:37.326 A:middle
If you want your CollectionView
to be a dragging source,

00:42:37.326 --> 00:42:39.186 A:middle
meaning that items can
be dragged out of it,

00:42:40.256 --> 00:42:42.846 A:middle
your basic responsibility
is to be able to put items

00:42:42.906 --> 00:42:45.916 A:middle
on the pasteboard when
requested by the CollectionView.

00:42:46.036 --> 00:42:47.646 A:middle
If you want to be a
dragging destination,

00:42:47.646 --> 00:42:50.566 A:middle
if you want to receive
drops, you need to be able

00:42:50.566 --> 00:42:53.666 A:middle
to assess a proposed drop,
CollectionView will call you,

00:42:53.666 --> 00:42:56.246 A:middle
say I want -- I'm proposing
to drop these objects

00:42:56.246 --> 00:42:59.306 A:middle
from the pasteboard onto
this target position,

00:42:59.306 --> 00:43:02.706 A:middle
which will be an index path,
indicating either a gap



00:42:59.306 --> 00:43:02.706 A:middle
which will be an index path,
indicating either a gap

00:43:02.746 --> 00:43:07.116 A:middle
between items, before an item
that's named, or a position

00:43:07.116 --> 00:43:08.606 A:middle
on top of an existing item,

00:43:08.736 --> 00:43:10.176 A:middle
if you're letting it
act like a container.

00:43:10.176 --> 00:43:11.296 A:middle
There will be an operation,

00:43:11.296 --> 00:43:13.366 A:middle
these are the standard
drag operations,

00:43:13.366 --> 00:43:15.906 A:middle
like copy, move, et cetera.

00:43:15.976 --> 00:43:18.776 A:middle
You can look at this proposal,
you can optionally override any

00:43:18.776 --> 00:43:21.156 A:middle
of these parameters, say
no, I would like to propose

00:43:21.156 --> 00:43:23.556 A:middle
that instead, you actually
target this position

00:43:23.556 --> 00:43:25.116 A:middle
for drop, or refuse the drop.

00:43:25.566 --> 00:43:27.886 A:middle
You need to be able to
implement the drop acceptance,

00:43:27.886 --> 00:43:30.146 A:middle
which is very similar, but
then the user has committed

00:43:30.146 --> 00:43:32.476 A:middle
to the drop, and you
need to go through,

00:43:32.476 --> 00:43:34.946 A:middle
and look at modifying
your model accordingly,

00:43:35.006 --> 00:43:36.526 A:middle
and updating the
CollectionView accordingly.

00:43:37.026 --> 00:43:41.206 A:middle
The mechanics of this boil down
to these APIs, you need to,

00:43:41.206 --> 00:43:45.436 A:middle
like any other NSView, you want
to register for the drag types

00:43:45.436 --> 00:43:46.936 A:middle
that you want to
be able to accept,

00:43:47.026 --> 00:43:48.866 A:middle
because collection view
generically doesn't know what

00:43:48.866 --> 00:43:51.616 A:middle
types of objects you deal
with in terms of your model.

00:43:51.986 --> 00:43:54.806 A:middle
CollectionView has a Dragging
Source Operation Mask,

00:43:54.806 --> 00:43:56.976 A:middle
both for local and
non-local drags.

00:43:56.976 --> 00:43:59.046 A:middle
This is just basically
letting you set in advance,

00:43:59.356 --> 00:44:02.816 A:middle
I support copy and move but not
alias, or something like that.



00:43:59.356 --> 00:44:02.816 A:middle
I support copy and move but not
alias, or something like that.

00:44:03.346 --> 00:44:04.626 A:middle
You want to set that up.

00:44:04.896 --> 00:44:06.836 A:middle
We do that in our
example as you will see.

00:44:07.836 --> 00:44:10.426 A:middle
Then the required delegate
methods that correspond

00:44:10.426 --> 00:44:12.906 A:middle
to the responsibilities I
mentioned on the previous slide.

00:44:13.446 --> 00:44:16.426 A:middle
Again, you need to be able to
write items to the pasteboard,

00:44:16.556 --> 00:44:18.956 A:middle
in the modern API you can
provide a pasteboard writer

00:44:18.956 --> 00:44:21.106 A:middle
for an item in an index path.

00:44:21.336 --> 00:44:22.336 A:middle
That lets you deal

00:44:22.336 --> 00:44:24.536 A:middle
with multi-item drags
much more gracefully.

00:44:25.186 --> 00:44:27.836 A:middle
Certain data types are
pasteboard writers.

00:44:27.836 --> 00:44:31.926 A:middle
In this example, NSURL,
if it is an absolute URL,

00:44:31.926 --> 00:44:34.446 A:middle
you can just return the
URL as a pasteboard writer,

00:44:34.946 --> 00:44:36.636 A:middle
and it knows how to write
itself to the pasteboard.

00:44:36.846 --> 00:44:39.996 A:middle
Alternatively, you can implement
Write Items At Index Paths,

00:44:40.066 --> 00:44:42.156 A:middle
toPasteboard, either
way, you're covered.

00:44:42.796 --> 00:44:44.566 A:middle
Now, to be a dragging
destination, again,

00:44:44.566 --> 00:44:46.386 A:middle
there's a Validate
Drop Delegate method,

00:44:46.746 --> 00:44:48.626 A:middle
and an Accept Drop
Delegate method,

00:44:48.626 --> 00:44:49.956 A:middle
to abbreviate them
a little bit there.

00:44:50.226 --> 00:44:52.686 A:middle
And you'll see those
implemented in our code sample.

00:44:53.236 --> 00:44:56.206 A:middle
We don't have time to walk
through the code sample

00:44:56.206 --> 00:44:58.526 A:middle
in detail today, because drag
and drop is fairly involved.

00:44:58.526 --> 00:45:01.476 A:middle
It's designed to be,
enabling you to drag items



00:44:58.526 --> 00:45:01.476 A:middle
It's designed to be,
enabling you to drag items

00:45:01.826 --> 00:45:03.166 A:middle
from one application to another.

00:45:03.166 --> 00:45:05.586 A:middle
There is a lot to it, but
there are some fundamental tips

00:45:05.676 --> 00:45:06.586 A:middle
to understand.

00:45:06.586 --> 00:45:09.786 A:middle
Once you get these concepts,
the rest is just mechanics,

00:45:09.786 --> 00:45:10.796 A:middle
and you'll be able to see it all

00:45:10.796 --> 00:45:13.876 A:middle
in the heavily-commented
code for our sample today.

00:45:15.226 --> 00:45:19.266 A:middle
The important things to
remember, it is worth figuring

00:45:19.266 --> 00:45:22.606 A:middle
out and especially handling the
case where a drag is happening

00:45:22.606 --> 00:45:23.936 A:middle
within your CollectionView.

00:45:24.346 --> 00:45:28.306 A:middle
When you start to get dragging
destination delegate messages,

00:45:28.306 --> 00:45:30.686 A:middle
it is worth being
able to say, hey,

00:45:31.006 --> 00:45:33.386 A:middle
I know that this drag
originated within myself,

00:45:33.386 --> 00:45:35.816 A:middle
I know which items, which
index paths, are being dragged

00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:38.446 A:middle
so I can handle this a lot
more simply than, sort of,

00:45:38.446 --> 00:45:40.306 A:middle
the general, oh, this drag
can be coming from anywhere

00:45:40.306 --> 00:45:42.936 A:middle
in the system, I have to pull
things off the pasteboard,

00:45:42.936 --> 00:45:44.156 A:middle
and so on.

00:45:44.756 --> 00:45:46.556 A:middle
This lets you, with
CollectionView,

00:45:46.556 --> 00:45:47.766 A:middle
it lets you tell
the CollectionView

00:45:47.766 --> 00:45:50.216 A:middle
that you're just moving
items from these index paths,

00:45:50.216 --> 00:45:51.326 A:middle
to these new index paths,

00:45:51.326 --> 00:45:53.026 A:middle
and can give you a
nice slick animation

00:45:53.336 --> 00:45:54.626 A:middle
as a side benefit of that.

00:45:54.806 --> 00:45:57.196 A:middle
It's a lot better,
more sophisticated

00:45:57.196 --> 00:46:00.006 A:middle
than removing the
items and then, oh,



00:45:57.196 --> 00:46:00.006 A:middle
than removing the
items and then, oh,

00:46:00.006 --> 00:46:02.386 A:middle
I have to reinsert these
same items somewhere else,

00:46:02.646 --> 00:46:03.576 A:middle
and reconstitute them.

00:46:04.156 --> 00:46:06.376 A:middle
A handy place to do this
is in the CollectionView,

00:46:06.376 --> 00:46:08.826 A:middle
dragging Session Will
Begin At Point For Items

00:46:08.826 --> 00:46:11.386 A:middle
At Index Paths delegate method.

00:46:11.486 --> 00:46:13.316 A:middle
It's an optional method,
but it's a good place

00:46:13.316 --> 00:46:16.946 A:middle
to catch those index paths,
stash them in a private property

00:46:17.226 --> 00:46:21.446 A:middle
of your data source, so you can
find that later, and say, aha,

00:46:21.526 --> 00:46:23.546 A:middle
I can handle this much more
simply, and you will see

00:46:23.546 --> 00:46:26.186 A:middle
where the code sample does that.

00:46:26.396 --> 00:46:30.086 A:middle
I wanted to leave time to
look at customizing layout.

00:46:30.086 --> 00:46:31.876 A:middle
That's more interesting and fun.

00:46:32.036 --> 00:46:33.356 A:middle
Let's go to that.

00:46:34.356 --> 00:46:38.066 A:middle
It's our last task, we're going
to look at both what you need

00:46:38.066 --> 00:46:39.656 A:middle
to do to adjust an
existing layout,

00:46:39.656 --> 00:46:42.296 A:middle
let's say Flow does almost
what you want, but you want

00:46:42.296 --> 00:46:44.506 A:middle
to tweak it just a bit to
get everything pixel perfect,

00:46:44.596 --> 00:46:48.126 A:middle
you know, I have heard
of doing that before!

00:46:48.216 --> 00:46:52.016 A:middle
Or, maybe you want to implement
a completely custom new type

00:46:52.016 --> 00:46:53.356 A:middle
of layout as we have done here,

00:46:53.466 --> 00:46:56.916 A:middle
with our various other
arrangements of slides.

00:46:57.166 --> 00:46:58.976 A:middle
We'll look at what it
takes to do that too.

00:46:59.476 --> 00:47:01.926 A:middle
Adjusting an existing layout
takes a little less work.



00:46:59.476 --> 00:47:01.926 A:middle
Adjusting an existing layout
takes a little less work.

00:47:02.196 --> 00:47:03.066 A:middle
We'll look at that first.

00:47:03.316 --> 00:47:05.766 A:middle
Let's say you want to
subclass the flow layout class

00:47:05.806 --> 00:47:08.436 A:middle
to adjust item positioning
just a little bit,

00:47:08.436 --> 00:47:09.386 A:middle
tweak things here and there.

00:47:09.976 --> 00:47:11.856 A:middle
You can do that with a
delegate, but let's just suppose

00:47:11.856 --> 00:47:13.916 A:middle
that you want to do something
that you find you can't do,

00:47:14.216 --> 00:47:15.516 A:middle
with the existing delegate API.

00:47:16.756 --> 00:47:20.616 A:middle
This is the main workhorse
method to understand.

00:47:20.896 --> 00:47:23.436 A:middle
So far this is the
same as on iOS.

00:47:23.436 --> 00:47:26.346 A:middle
Layout Attributes For Elements
In Rect is a very general API.

00:47:26.346 --> 00:47:27.686 A:middle
CollectionView calls in,

00:47:27.686 --> 00:47:30.476 A:middle
and it passes you a
rectangle that's a rectangle

00:47:30.476 --> 00:47:33.406 A:middle
in the CollectionViews internal
bounds coordinate system.

00:47:33.406 --> 00:47:35.986 A:middle
It's basically saying, hey,
what's in this rectangle?

00:47:36.506 --> 00:47:38.466 A:middle
You're obliged to
return an array

00:47:38.606 --> 00:47:39.946 A:middle
of layout attributes objects.

00:47:39.946 --> 00:47:43.386 A:middle
Remember, that's our
encapsulation of descriptions

00:47:43.386 --> 00:47:44.806 A:middle
of items, independent of having

00:47:44.806 --> 00:47:47.086 A:middle
to actually instantiate
the items just yet.

00:47:47.546 --> 00:47:50.196 A:middle
You are going to return it
information about items,

00:47:50.196 --> 00:47:52.076 A:middle
and if you have header
and footer views,

00:47:52.076 --> 00:47:54.056 A:middle
or other supplementary views
that could be in that area,

00:47:54.506 --> 00:47:56.006 A:middle
you have to figure
out what's there,

00:47:56.006 --> 00:47:57.316 A:middle
and return those descriptions.

00:47:57.556 --> 00:47:59.796 A:middle
This is obviously
highly dependent

00:47:59.796 --> 00:48:01.536 A:middle
on what your layout
algorithm is.



00:47:59.796 --> 00:48:01.536 A:middle
on what your layout
algorithm is.

00:48:01.536 --> 00:48:02.826 A:middle
It could be anything, right?

00:48:02.826 --> 00:48:04.536 A:middle
So you are going to traverse
your own internal data

00:48:04.536 --> 00:48:06.156 A:middle
structures, you want
to figure out how

00:48:06.156 --> 00:48:07.896 A:middle
to do this really
efficiently for your layout.

00:48:08.136 --> 00:48:09.866 A:middle
That is this methods'
responsibility,

00:48:09.866 --> 00:48:11.826 A:middle
to return descriptions of
everything in a rectangle.

00:48:12.296 --> 00:48:14.206 A:middle
That's the workhorse,
that's what gets called,

00:48:14.206 --> 00:48:15.586 A:middle
when the CollectionView
first lays

00:48:15.586 --> 00:48:17.326 A:middle
out the items you have given it.

00:48:17.776 --> 00:48:20.046 A:middle
Then, there is this companion,
Layout Attributes For Item

00:48:20.046 --> 00:48:21.766 A:middle
At Index Path, almost
seems superfluous,

00:48:21.806 --> 00:48:25.636 A:middle
but the CollectionView needs to
ask about specific items, say,

00:48:25.636 --> 00:48:27.156 A:middle
just describe this item to me,

00:48:27.526 --> 00:48:28.976 A:middle
and that's what you're
supposed to do here.

00:48:28.976 --> 00:48:32.426 A:middle
If there is no item at that
index path you return nil.

00:48:32.976 --> 00:48:35.836 A:middle
Usually, there is,
if it is asking.

00:48:35.966 --> 00:48:38.726 A:middle
This gets invoked when you're
doing things like moving items

00:48:38.826 --> 00:48:40.106 A:middle
from one place to another.

00:48:40.846 --> 00:48:43.206 A:middle
So you want to implement that
too, and the results need

00:48:43.206 --> 00:48:44.906 A:middle
to be consistent with
the first method.

00:48:45.446 --> 00:48:50.556 A:middle
Then there is Invalidate Layout
With Context, which is sort

00:48:50.556 --> 00:48:54.356 A:middle
of a general invalidation method
that CollectionView will invoke

00:48:54.576 --> 00:48:56.686 A:middle
with a context, that, if
you look at its properties,

00:48:56.686 --> 00:48:58.406 A:middle
examine it, it is
the same as on iOS,

00:48:58.636 --> 00:49:00.316 A:middle
it describes what's changed.



00:48:58.636 --> 00:49:00.316 A:middle
it describes what's changed.

00:49:00.316 --> 00:49:01.876 A:middle
Items were inserted or removed,

00:49:01.876 --> 00:49:04.056 A:middle
maybe the CollectionView is
resizing, any of a number

00:49:04.056 --> 00:49:05.136 A:middle
of things could be happening.

00:49:05.616 --> 00:49:08.706 A:middle
Examining the context properties
gives you the opportunity

00:49:08.936 --> 00:49:11.076 A:middle
to just try to be as smart
and efficient as you can.

00:49:11.076 --> 00:49:13.536 A:middle
This is sort of a later
optimization you might want

00:49:13.536 --> 00:49:16.236 A:middle
to do, after you get your layout
just basically working the way

00:49:16.236 --> 00:49:17.426 A:middle
you want it to.

00:49:17.686 --> 00:49:22.006 A:middle
This is your chance to blow
away any invalidated state stuff

00:49:22.006 --> 00:49:24.676 A:middle
that is internal state that
you track for your layout,

00:49:24.676 --> 00:49:28.436 A:middle
your own description of it
when certain changes happen.

00:49:29.486 --> 00:49:32.106 A:middle
So we're just seeing
Flow layout,

00:49:32.106 --> 00:49:33.676 A:middle
then let's say we're going

00:49:33.676 --> 00:49:36.046 A:middle
to implement those
first two methods,

00:49:36.046 --> 00:49:39.416 A:middle
the layout attributes returning
methods, to call up to super,

00:49:39.846 --> 00:49:42.466 A:middle
see what NSCollectionView
Flow layout proposes,

00:49:42.706 --> 00:49:46.316 A:middle
we can examine the resultant
layout attributes instance,

00:49:46.316 --> 00:49:49.086 A:middle
or array of them, and make
whatever tweaks we want to,

00:49:49.086 --> 00:49:51.326 A:middle
and return a new array
of layout attributes,

00:49:51.326 --> 00:49:52.446 A:middle
or a single array of
layout attributes.

00:49:52.446 --> 00:49:54.316 A:middle
That's pretty much
what there is to that,

00:49:54.316 --> 00:49:56.956 A:middle
as long as the changes you're
making don't change the amount

00:49:56.956 --> 00:49:57.986 A:middle
of space the layout needs.

00:49:59.396 --> 00:50:01.516 A:middle
What if you want to implement
a completely custom layout,



00:49:59.396 --> 00:50:01.516 A:middle
What if you want to implement
a completely custom layout,

00:50:01.516 --> 00:50:02.306 A:middle
like we have done here?

00:50:02.966 --> 00:50:05.076 A:middle
You can subclass
NSCollectionView layout

00:50:05.076 --> 00:50:07.046 A:middle
directly, to just do
everything from scratch,

00:50:07.046 --> 00:50:09.676 A:middle
if your layout has nothing in
common with Flow, for example.

00:50:10.456 --> 00:50:12.816 A:middle
You implement the same
methods that we described

00:50:12.816 --> 00:50:13.746 A:middle
on the previous slide.

00:50:14.526 --> 00:50:15.916 A:middle
In addition, you need to be able

00:50:15.916 --> 00:50:20.636 A:middle
to answer certain basic
questions, like, what's the size

00:50:20.636 --> 00:50:23.006 A:middle
that you need, the width and
height, to display the items

00:50:23.006 --> 00:50:24.756 A:middle
that the CollectionView
has to offer?

00:50:25.326 --> 00:50:27.576 A:middle
You basically just telling the
CollectionView here what's the

00:50:27.766 --> 00:50:30.356 A:middle
size of my document view within?

00:50:30.356 --> 00:50:31.806 A:middle
-- this determines
your scrollable area.

00:50:33.726 --> 00:50:36.606 A:middle
Should Invalidate Layout For
Bounds Change returns a Boolean,

00:50:36.606 --> 00:50:38.566 A:middle
so CollectionView is
going to invoke this

00:50:38.566 --> 00:50:39.866 A:middle
when it's being resized.

00:50:40.346 --> 00:50:43.826 A:middle
And typically you'll look at,
What's my layout algorithm?

00:50:43.906 --> 00:50:46.256 A:middle
Is my layout affected
by this resize?

00:50:46.526 --> 00:50:49.196 A:middle
If you're a Flow layout
for example, a vertical one

00:50:49.196 --> 00:50:52.466 A:middle
that lays things out into rows,
maybe you don't care so much

00:50:52.506 --> 00:50:55.136 A:middle
if the CollectionViews
height is changing, right?

00:50:55.136 --> 00:50:56.546 A:middle
That just gives you
more or less space.

00:50:56.606 --> 00:50:58.916 A:middle
But,if the width is changing,
you may have to reflow.

00:50:59.256 --> 00:51:01.296 A:middle
You may return yes in
that case for example.



00:50:59.256 --> 00:51:01.296 A:middle
You may return yes in
that case for example.

00:51:01.576 --> 00:51:03.976 A:middle
That's what that method does.

00:51:04.726 --> 00:51:07.946 A:middle
If you're modifying the flow
layout so that the amount

00:51:07.946 --> 00:51:10.076 A:middle
of space you need changes,
you may actually need

00:51:10.076 --> 00:51:13.176 A:middle
to implement those two, even
for a slightly customized flow.

00:51:14.666 --> 00:51:16.886 A:middle
These methods, however,
are brand-new on OS X,

00:51:16.886 --> 00:51:19.606 A:middle
I mentioned we have the
ability now to hit test,

00:51:19.606 --> 00:51:21.676 A:middle
to have a layout
in the abstract,

00:51:21.766 --> 00:51:24.016 A:middle
hit test for drop targets.

00:51:24.266 --> 00:51:25.856 A:middle
That's a powerful new feature.

00:51:26.266 --> 00:51:28.366 A:middle
You can define this for
any of your custom layouts,

00:51:28.746 --> 00:51:31.506 A:middle
Layout Attribute For Drop Target
At Point is the first method.

00:51:32.086 --> 00:51:34.966 A:middle
If the target is an item,
that's pretty straightforward.

00:51:34.966 --> 00:51:36.626 A:middle
You're going to return
an attribute,

00:51:36.626 --> 00:51:37.976 A:middle
a layout attributes instance,

00:51:38.416 --> 00:51:40.516 A:middle
whose represented
element category is Item.

00:51:41.216 --> 00:51:43.326 A:middle
You're proposing
dropping on an item,

00:51:43.976 --> 00:51:47.146 A:middle
you plug the index path in, of
the item you have identified

00:51:47.146 --> 00:51:50.276 A:middle
that would be dropped
onto, and then you want

00:51:50.276 --> 00:51:54.126 A:middle
to return the bounding box
of that item as the frame

00:51:54.126 --> 00:51:55.036 A:middle
of the layout attribute.

00:51:55.036 --> 00:51:56.356 A:middle
That's imple enough.

00:51:56.606 --> 00:51:59.116 A:middle
A more interesting case, now,
that we didn't have to deal

00:51:59.116 --> 00:52:01.476 A:middle
with on iOS, is gaps
between items.



00:51:59.116 --> 00:52:01.476 A:middle
with on iOS, is gaps
between items.

00:52:02.646 --> 00:52:05.536 A:middle
If you determine that the point
that's being hit tested is

00:52:05.536 --> 00:52:08.556 A:middle
between items, and you
can identify, in some sort

00:52:08.556 --> 00:52:11.716 A:middle
of serial order of the
items, where that gap is, OK,

00:52:11.716 --> 00:52:15.376 A:middle
t is between item at index
6 and index 7, you may want

00:52:15.376 --> 00:52:16.846 A:middle
to return an Inter Item Gap.

00:52:17.866 --> 00:52:21.126 A:middle
That will let users drop between
your items in your layout.

00:52:21.546 --> 00:52:24.316 A:middle
You return one whose element
category is Inter Item Gap,

00:52:25.036 --> 00:52:28.106 A:middle
the attribute's index
path is the index path

00:52:28.396 --> 00:52:30.426 A:middle
of the item after the gap.

00:52:30.426 --> 00:52:33.276 A:middle
If you're between 6 and 7,
you return the index path

00:52:33.276 --> 00:52:35.186 A:middle
that specifies item
7 in that section.

00:52:36.416 --> 00:52:39.856 A:middle
Then again, you return as the
attributes frame, a bounding box

00:52:40.146 --> 00:52:44.076 A:middle
of that gap, the CollectionView
will use that bounding box

00:52:44.076 --> 00:52:46.986 A:middle
to figure out how to draw its
standard indicators somewhere

00:52:46.986 --> 00:52:47.906 A:middle
in that rectangle.

00:52:48.196 --> 00:52:53.446 A:middle
Next there is a method
called Layout Attributes

00:52:53.446 --> 00:52:55.596 A:middle
For Inter Item Gap
Before Index Path.

00:52:55.596 --> 00:52:58.106 A:middle
CollectionView sometimes needs
this too, and it will ask

00:52:58.106 --> 00:53:01.556 A:middle
about a particular position, and
ask you to describe that gap.



00:52:58.106 --> 00:53:01.556 A:middle
about a particular position, and
ask you to describe that gap.

00:53:02.116 --> 00:53:03.806 A:middle
So here we return an Attributes

00:53:03.806 --> 00:53:05.476 A:middle
With Element Category
Inter Item Gap,

00:53:05.846 --> 00:53:08.586 A:middle
it's represented element kind
is Inter Item Gap Indicator,

00:53:08.946 --> 00:53:10.926 A:middle
so this is really,
we're using this to set

00:53:10.926 --> 00:53:12.316 A:middle
up a supplementary view.

00:53:12.316 --> 00:53:15.156 A:middle
That's how the Inter Item
Gap Indicator is implemented,

00:53:15.906 --> 00:53:17.926 A:middle
you just plug in the index
path that you are given,

00:53:18.606 --> 00:53:20.766 A:middle
and your return is
the attributes frames

00:53:20.866 --> 00:53:22.106 A:middle
as the Rect of the gap.

00:53:22.206 --> 00:53:23.816 A:middle
With these two methods together,

00:53:24.156 --> 00:53:29.106 A:middle
CollectionView can support drop
target indication between items,

00:53:29.106 --> 00:53:32.516 A:middle
even for potentially-arbitrary
custom layouts

00:53:32.516 --> 00:53:34.596 A:middle
of your own design,
which is pretty neat.

00:53:35.566 --> 00:53:37.486 A:middle
We'll look briefly at
our custom layouts,

00:53:37.486 --> 00:53:40.066 A:middle
and how they're implemented
as our last demo.

00:53:47.616 --> 00:53:49.586 A:middle
Looking here on the
left-sidebar,

00:53:49.976 --> 00:53:51.386 A:middle
we have the code categorized.

00:53:51.386 --> 00:53:53.346 A:middle
We have a layouts group,
you want to look in there.

00:53:53.726 --> 00:53:55.626 A:middle
We'll look at one example today.

00:53:56.216 --> 00:53:57.166 A:middle
The circular layout.



00:54:00.686 --> 00:54:03.276 A:middle
It is fairly simple.

00:54:03.396 --> 00:54:06.476 A:middle
We implement Layout Attributes
For An Item At Index Path,

00:54:06.476 --> 00:54:08.256 A:middle
that's where we're asked
about a particular item.

00:54:09.046 --> 00:54:12.626 A:middle
All we're doing here in concept,
is we're taking the item index

00:54:13.266 --> 00:54:15.706 A:middle
from the index path,
and that's going

00:54:15.706 --> 00:54:18.106 A:middle
to define how far we
are around the circle.

00:54:18.416 --> 00:54:23.636 A:middle
We use that to compute an
angle from 0 to 2 Pi radians.

00:54:23.946 --> 00:54:26.776 A:middle
That lets us compute a frame
for where the slide should go.

00:54:27.696 --> 00:54:31.736 A:middle
Then the important part is
here, the API is a little touchy

00:54:31.736 --> 00:54:34.366 A:middle
to how you instantiate
layout attributes instances,

00:54:34.366 --> 00:54:36.626 A:middle
to get one that's
bound to the index path

00:54:36.676 --> 00:54:38.026 A:middle
that it references correctly,

00:54:38.336 --> 00:54:39.906 A:middle
you want to be careful
to do it this way.

00:54:40.676 --> 00:54:44.986 A:middle
We'll actually talk
to the layouts class,

00:54:45.366 --> 00:54:48.116 A:middle
and get the corresponding
layout attributes class,

00:54:48.146 --> 00:54:52.446 A:middle
basically having this API
allows for layout attributes

00:54:52.506 --> 00:54:54.736 A:middle
for the NSCollectionView
Layout Attributes Class

00:54:54.956 --> 00:54:56.516 A:middle
to be subclassed and extended.

00:54:56.806 --> 00:54:59.516 A:middle
You may have some really
custom layout, just as on iOS,

00:54:59.806 --> 00:55:01.906 A:middle
that needs to work
with other attributes



00:54:59.806 --> 00:55:01.906 A:middle
that needs to work
with other attributes

00:55:01.906 --> 00:55:04.356 A:middle
or remember other things about
items that it's laid out,

00:55:04.586 --> 00:55:06.756 A:middle
you can add those
properties by subclassing.

00:55:07.436 --> 00:55:09.296 A:middle
You override layout
attribute class

00:55:09.366 --> 00:55:11.336 A:middle
to return your own subclass.

00:55:12.026 --> 00:55:15.006 A:middle
This way we make sure we're
instantiating a subclass

00:55:15.006 --> 00:55:15.716 A:middle
if we need to.

00:55:16.026 --> 00:55:17.696 A:middle
The appropriate one.

00:55:17.826 --> 00:55:21.286 A:middle
We invoke this factory method,
Layout Attributes For Items

00:55:21.286 --> 00:55:23.816 A:middle
With Index Path, we pass
in that path we were given.

00:55:23.816 --> 00:55:26.146 A:middle
Once we have got a layout
attributes object back,

00:55:27.186 --> 00:55:29.596 A:middle
we set the properties we
want to, we set the frame,

00:55:29.596 --> 00:55:33.056 A:middle
the Z index for back-to-front
sort order in the layer world,

00:55:33.056 --> 00:55:34.376 A:middle
and then we return

00:55:34.376 --> 00:55:36.546 A:middle
that attributes instance
back to CollectionView.

00:55:37.186 --> 00:55:39.676 A:middle
We have a superclass,
where for all

00:55:39.676 --> 00:55:43.506 A:middle
of our custom layouts we have
implemented the Rect-taking

00:55:43.506 --> 00:55:46.546 A:middle
method, Layout Attributes
For Elements In Rect,

00:55:46.546 --> 00:55:48.716 A:middle
and we can do that, because
in this case, what's special

00:55:48.716 --> 00:55:50.906 A:middle
about all of these layouts,
in this case is rather

00:55:50.906 --> 00:55:53.096 A:middle
than being scrollable
layouts, that just grow

00:55:53.096 --> 00:55:55.916 A:middle
to whatever size they need
to display their items,

00:55:56.136 --> 00:55:58.206 A:middle
these all choose to display all

00:55:58.206 --> 00:56:00.956 A:middle
of the CollectionViews
items in the visible area.



00:55:58.206 --> 00:56:00.956 A:middle
of the CollectionViews
items in the visible area.

00:56:01.356 --> 00:56:04.336 A:middle
So the implementation of this
method is basically always

00:56:04.376 --> 00:56:04.816 A:middle
the same.

00:56:04.816 --> 00:56:07.736 A:middle
We are looking at the Rect,
and we are going to look

00:56:07.736 --> 00:56:09.446 A:middle
at every item we have.

00:56:09.976 --> 00:56:13.766 A:middle
We're returning descriptions of
those back to CollectionView,

00:56:14.076 --> 00:56:16.956 A:middle
so we're actually just
leveraging the Layout Attributes

00:56:16.956 --> 00:56:18.536 A:middle
For Item At Index Path method,

00:56:18.746 --> 00:56:20.546 A:middle
that we implement
in the subclass.

00:56:21.486 --> 00:56:23.926 A:middle
CollectionView Content
Size is the same for all

00:56:23.926 --> 00:56:25.476 A:middle
of these slide layouts,
we're just looking

00:56:25.476 --> 00:56:28.846 A:middle
at the clipped view's bound
size, what area do we have,

00:56:28.846 --> 00:56:29.946 A:middle
that's visible to the user?

00:56:29.946 --> 00:56:31.676 A:middle
We're going to lay out
everything out within there,

00:56:31.936 --> 00:56:34.336 A:middle
and because we're doing
that, we're also going

00:56:34.336 --> 00:56:36.906 A:middle
to invalidate layout
when the bounds change,

00:56:36.906 --> 00:56:39.776 A:middle
regardless of what the change
is, we want to re-layout,

00:56:39.896 --> 00:56:43.986 A:middle
so that we can use the
available space appropriately.

00:56:44.676 --> 00:56:48.196 A:middle
Prepare Layout, as on iOS, this
is just a handy little hook

00:56:48.196 --> 00:56:51.046 A:middle
for when layout parameters have
changed, and you're being called

00:56:51.046 --> 00:56:52.536 A:middle
at the start of a
new layout cycle,

00:56:52.806 --> 00:56:55.276 A:middle
you can do any pre-computation
you want to in there,

00:56:55.516 --> 00:56:57.686 A:middle
and just gets invoked once,
at the start of the cycle.

00:56:58.636 --> 00:57:01.096 A:middle
We can look at our
layouts in action here.



00:56:58.636 --> 00:57:01.096 A:middle
We can look at our
layouts in action here.

00:57:07.556 --> 00:57:11.456 A:middle
And say for the circular
layout as we resize,

00:57:11.456 --> 00:57:13.906 A:middle
the layout is getting
invalidated each time,

00:57:13.906 --> 00:57:16.616 A:middle
because we want to make
the biggest circle we can,

00:57:16.886 --> 00:57:19.066 A:middle
leaving some margins
within the available area.

00:57:19.916 --> 00:57:24.666 A:middle
By implementing those
relatively-few required methods,

00:57:25.036 --> 00:57:26.736 A:middle
we have a completely
custom layout.

00:57:26.736 --> 00:57:27.746 A:middle
And again, as before,

00:57:28.116 --> 00:57:32.046 A:middle
it supports crossing selection
here, and click selection,

00:57:32.576 --> 00:57:34.336 A:middle
and it is very versatile.

00:57:35.706 --> 00:57:38.536 A:middle
So, it doesn't take much to
define your own layouts for use

00:57:39.616 --> 00:57:42.766 A:middle
within NSCollectionView, and
in fact the layout classes,

00:57:42.806 --> 00:57:45.566 A:middle
the APIs you will find,
except for those additions,

00:57:45.566 --> 00:57:48.606 A:middle
those augmentations we made to
support drop target hit-testing,

00:57:48.976 --> 00:57:51.126 A:middle
basically the API
is the same as iOS,

00:57:51.126 --> 00:57:52.836 A:middle
so if you have the layouts
you have used on iOS,

00:57:53.266 --> 00:57:57.516 A:middle
you should find it very
easy to port those to OS X.

00:57:57.516 --> 00:57:59.236 A:middle
We have covered a lot
of topics here today,

00:57:59.236 --> 00:58:02.696 A:middle
we've basically made an
example run, and you have access



00:57:59.236 --> 00:58:02.696 A:middle
we've basically made an
example run, and you have access

00:58:02.696 --> 00:58:04.036 A:middle
to the complete source
code to that.

00:58:04.036 --> 00:58:05.816 A:middle
I encourage you to study it,

00:58:05.996 --> 00:58:09.586 A:middle
it should help you get started
using the new NSCollectionView

00:58:09.816 --> 00:58:10.866 A:middle
on El Capitan.

00:58:11.636 --> 00:58:15.586 A:middle
In conclusion, we have
got a greatly enhanced

00:58:15.586 --> 00:58:17.946 A:middle
NSCollectionView, I hope
you'll agree on El Capitan,

00:58:17.946 --> 00:58:20.716 A:middle
it is ready now to handle
scalability to large numbers

00:58:20.716 --> 00:58:23.736 A:middle
of items, flexibility
to arbitrary layouts,

00:58:24.396 --> 00:58:27.316 A:middle
and all of the toughest projects
you may want to throw at it.

00:58:27.466 --> 00:58:28.806 A:middle
We encourage you to do so.

00:58:29.016 --> 00:58:30.046 A:middle
Let us know what works.

00:58:30.046 --> 00:58:31.756 A:middle
Let us know what you
have challenges with.

00:58:31.756 --> 00:58:34.196 A:middle
If you need any help
or guidance,

00:58:34.196 --> 00:58:35.476 A:middle
we have a lab dedicated

00:58:35.476 --> 00:58:37.536 A:middle
to CollectionView
specifically tomorrow morning

00:58:37.796 --> 00:58:41.046 A:middle
in Foundation Lab B downstairs,
Frameworks Lab B, sorry,

00:58:41.526 --> 00:58:44.536 A:middle
at the foundation of the
building, 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

00:58:44.536 --> 00:58:46.746 A:middle
I'll be there along with
other engineers from our team

00:58:46.746 --> 00:58:47.936 A:middle
who understand CollectionView.

00:58:48.886 --> 00:58:51.276 A:middle
Be sure to look at not
just the documentation,

00:58:51.276 --> 00:58:53.216 A:middle
but also the Application
Kit Release Notes,

00:58:53.216 --> 00:58:55.976 A:middle
I have personally put notes
about CollectionView use

00:58:55.976 --> 00:59:00.776 A:middle
in there, details about how
to set them up, and also,



00:58:55.976 --> 00:59:00.776 A:middle
in there, details about how
to set them up, and also,

00:59:00.776 --> 00:59:01.696 A:middle
you will find information

00:59:01.696 --> 00:59:03.486 A:middle
about all the other
great new stuff we have

00:59:03.486 --> 00:59:05.826 A:middle
in AppKit in 10.11.

00:59:06.896 --> 00:59:09.246 A:middle
If you missed What's New in
Cocoa, another great place

00:59:09.246 --> 00:59:12.376 A:middle
to find out about all the new
features that we have added,

00:59:12.376 --> 00:59:14.636 A:middle
it is quite a lot, it
didn't even fit in one talk,

00:59:15.006 --> 00:59:16.416 A:middle
I encourage you to
check that out,

00:59:16.456 --> 00:59:18.346 A:middle
on the session videos
that are available.

00:59:18.346 --> 00:59:21.426 A:middle
Last but not least we have
two great auto layout sessions

00:59:21.426 --> 00:59:24.026 A:middle
earlier today, if you're
using Auto Layout constraints

00:59:24.326 --> 00:59:26.786 A:middle
to position your controls
within your items,

00:59:27.076 --> 00:59:30.266 A:middle
it might be really helpful to
understand Auto Layout in depth.

00:59:30.836 --> 00:59:32.196 A:middle
Thank you very much for coming.

00:59:32.196 --> 00:59:33.726 A:middle
I look forward to
seeing what you create.

00:59:33.726 --> 00:59:35.366 A:middle
Enjoy the WWDC bash!

00:59:35.396 --> 00:59:36.476 A:middle
I'll see you tomorrow
morning in the lab.

00:59:37.508 --> 00:59:39.508 A:middle
[Applause]
