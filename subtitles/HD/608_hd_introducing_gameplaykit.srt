00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:33.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; BRUNO SOMMER: Hello
everyone and welcome.

00:00:34.216 --> 00:00:36.006 A:middle
My name is Bruno Sommer,

00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:37.856 A:middle
I'm a game technologies
engineer here at Apple.

00:00:38.226 --> 00:00:40.246 A:middle
And today I'm very
excited to be able

00:00:40.246 --> 00:00:43.196 A:middle
to introduce you to GameplayKit.

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:46.766 A:middle
Apple's first dedicated
Gameplay framework.

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:51.656 A:middle
We have a lot of solutions to
the visual part of making game

00:00:51.696 --> 00:00:55.266 A:middle
on our platform things like
SpriteKit, SceneKit and Metal.

00:00:56.196 --> 00:00:58.196 A:middle
The gameplay is another
really important part

00:00:58.196 --> 00:00:59.426 A:middle
of that game development puzzle.



00:01:00.296 --> 00:01:03.756 A:middle
As it turns out, there is hard
problems in the gameplay space,

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:07.316 A:middle
things like AI, pathfinding,
autonomous movement.

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:09.866 A:middle
We firmly believe

00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.856 A:middle
that experience shouldn't
be a barrier

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:16.016 A:middle
to prevent our developers making
great and compelling games.

00:01:17.196 --> 00:01:19.576 A:middle
So going forward we want
you guys to be able to focus

00:01:19.576 --> 00:01:21.026 A:middle
on bringing your
cool ideas to life.

00:01:21.486 --> 00:01:22.436 A:middle
And we'll do the heavy lifting

00:01:22.436 --> 00:01:25.496 A:middle
on the back end to
make that happen.

00:01:26.506 --> 00:01:27.416 A:middle
So our mission when we set

00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:29.196 A:middle
out to make GameplayKit
was very clear.

00:01:29.906 --> 00:01:32.616 A:middle
We wanted to make a simple,
yet powerful solution API

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:33.756 A:middle
of gameplay solutions.

00:01:33.756 --> 00:01:36.486 A:middle
Now this is things like
common design patterns

00:01:36.486 --> 00:01:39.086 A:middle
and architectures so we can
all start speaking the same

00:01:39.086 --> 00:01:39.826 A:middle
gameplay language.

00:01:40.646 --> 00:01:43.156 A:middle
And there's also a number of
standard gameplay algorithms

00:01:43.226 --> 00:01:45.946 A:middle
that is applicable to a
wide variety of game genres.

00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:49.526 A:middle
And it is also very important
to us that this remains graphic

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:52.066 A:middle
and engine agnostic, so
while GameplayKit is separate

00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:54.096 A:middle
from a lot of those visual
frameworks I talked about,

00:01:54.706 --> 00:01:55.836 A:middle
it plays really nicely
with them.

00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:59.256 A:middle
It plays nice with SpriteKit,
SceneKit, Metal, and more.

00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:04.126 A:middle
So here we have GameplayKit



00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:04.126 A:middle
So here we have GameplayKit

00:02:04.176 --> 00:02:06.236 A:middle
and the seven major
features that make it up.

00:02:07.236 --> 00:02:09.226 A:middle
And these are components
which are a really great way

00:02:09.226 --> 00:02:11.176 A:middle
to structure your game
objects and game logic.

00:02:12.536 --> 00:02:15.016 A:middle
State machines, which describe
the statefulness in our games

00:02:15.016 --> 00:02:17.136 A:middle
and the various state
changes of our game objects.

00:02:18.476 --> 00:02:20.946 A:middle
Agents, which are
autonomously moving entities

00:02:20.946 --> 00:02:23.516 A:middle
that are controlled by
realistic behaviors and goals.

00:02:24.776 --> 00:02:27.306 A:middle
Pathfinding, which deals with
navigation graph generation

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:28.616 A:middle
and how we move our entities

00:02:29.106 --> 00:02:30.856 A:middle
between the passable
areas in our game world.

00:02:30.856 --> 00:02:33.586 A:middle
We also have a great
MinMax AI solution

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:35.316 A:middle
which is a really
great way to give life

00:02:35.406 --> 00:02:36.936 A:middle
to our computer-controlled
opponents.

00:02:37.836 --> 00:02:40.346 A:middle
There is a number of game
quality random sources

00:02:40.346 --> 00:02:42.516 A:middle
and random distributions
at your disposal.

00:02:42.826 --> 00:02:44.916 A:middle
And last we have a rule system,
which are a really great way

00:02:45.096 --> 00:02:47.296 A:middle
to model discreet
and fuzzy logic.

00:02:48.346 --> 00:02:50.186 A:middle
There's a lot to cover today.

00:02:50.326 --> 00:02:53.596 A:middle
Let's go ahead and jump right
in with entities and components.

00:02:53.626 --> 00:02:59.816 A:middle
I want to pose sort of this
classic problem with inheriting

00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:01.216 A:middle
from common game objects.



00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:01.216 A:middle
from common game objects.

00:03:01.636 --> 00:03:02.786 A:middle
Here we have a tower
defense game

00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:05.916 A:middle
with a simple projectile
tower and archer classes.

00:03:07.266 --> 00:03:08.906 A:middle
We have some shared
functionality here.

00:03:09.736 --> 00:03:11.806 A:middle
We have shooting,
and we have moving,

00:03:11.806 --> 00:03:13.296 A:middle
and we have being targeted.

00:03:14.156 --> 00:03:15.636 A:middle
Let's take shooting for example.

00:03:15.976 --> 00:03:18.396 A:middle
We want towers and archers
to both be able to shoot.

00:03:18.856 --> 00:03:20.116 A:middle
Where then do we put
our shoot function?

00:03:21.656 --> 00:03:23.606 A:middle
One option might be to
simply copy and paste it

00:03:23.606 --> 00:03:25.286 A:middle
between the tower
and archer classes,

00:03:25.896 --> 00:03:28.526 A:middle
but now I have two spots in my
code that share functionality,

00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:30.546 A:middle
and if I ever want to
update that functionality,

00:03:30.826 --> 00:03:32.426 A:middle
there is now two spots
where I need to update it.

00:03:32.526 --> 00:03:34.696 A:middle
And if I only update it in
one I'm undoubtably going

00:03:34.696 --> 00:03:35.866 A:middle
to get some really
weird behavior.

00:03:36.776 --> 00:03:39.886 A:middle
So our only real option in
this inheritance model I've

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:42.426 A:middle
described, is to move
shared functionality higher

00:03:42.426 --> 00:03:42.866 A:middle
in the tree.

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:45.366 A:middle
So here we have a shoot
function we might put it

00:03:45.596 --> 00:03:48.086 A:middle
in the game object class
or some common-based class.

00:03:48.936 --> 00:03:51.466 A:middle
Now the problem with this
approach is that as we get more

00:03:51.466 --> 00:03:54.236 A:middle
and more shared functionality
in our games we're forced

00:03:54.236 --> 00:03:56.256 A:middle
to move it higher and
higher in the hierarchies.

00:03:56.716 --> 00:03:59.116 A:middle
And our basic game objects
become anything but basic.

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:02.926 A:middle
They become large and hard to
understand, hard to maintain,



00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:02.926 A:middle
They become large and hard to
understand, hard to maintain,

00:04:03.346 --> 00:04:04.386 A:middle
and hard to collaborate on.

00:04:05.446 --> 00:04:08.446 A:middle
Let's take a look at how
we solve this problem using

00:04:08.446 --> 00:04:09.366 A:middle
entities and components.

00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:12.126 A:middle
You see here we still
have our three objects:

00:04:12.126 --> 00:04:13.916 A:middle
projectile, tower, archer.

00:04:14.656 --> 00:04:16.956 A:middle
But now instead of them
having functionality

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:20.346 A:middle
in an inheritance sense, being
a mover, being a shooter,

00:04:20.346 --> 00:04:21.386 A:middle
or being targetable,

00:04:22.106 --> 00:04:24.576 A:middle
they instead have these
objects we call components

00:04:24.576 --> 00:04:26.996 A:middle
which encapsulate singular
elements of our game logic,

00:04:26.996 --> 00:04:29.776 A:middle
so here we have a MoveComponent
that deals with moving,

00:04:29.926 --> 00:04:33.016 A:middle
a ShootComponent that deals with
shooting, and a TargetComponent,

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:34.276 A:middle
what it means to be targetable.

00:04:34.276 --> 00:04:39.016 A:middle
So we gain these really
nice little black boxes

00:04:39.016 --> 00:04:41.336 A:middle
of singular functionality,
that are loosely rather

00:04:41.336 --> 00:04:43.156 A:middle
than tightly coupled
with the hierarchy.

00:04:43.156 --> 00:04:48.706 A:middle
So we see now that entities
and components are a great way

00:04:48.706 --> 00:04:50.026 A:middle
to organize our game logic.

00:04:51.336 --> 00:04:52.816 A:middle
For one, they're
easy to maintain

00:04:52.816 --> 00:04:54.716 A:middle
because they're these
nice black boxes

00:04:54.716 --> 00:04:57.276 A:middle
of incapsulated functionality;
they tend to be simpler.

00:04:58.696 --> 00:05:00.936 A:middle
We also have a really
nice collaboration



00:04:58.696 --> 00:05:00.936 A:middle
We also have a really
nice collaboration

00:05:00.936 --> 00:05:01.966 A:middle
with the entities
and components.

00:05:02.126 --> 00:05:04.196 A:middle
Now I can have one developer
work on one component

00:05:04.486 --> 00:05:06.586 A:middle
and another developer working
on yet another component,

00:05:06.856 --> 00:05:09.286 A:middle
and they don't necessarily need
to know the intimate details

00:05:09.436 --> 00:05:10.346 A:middle
between these components.

00:05:12.316 --> 00:05:14.336 A:middle
We also get nice
scaling with complexity.

00:05:14.336 --> 00:05:15.636 A:middle
What I mean by that,
in that class

00:05:15.636 --> 00:05:18.746 A:middle
and inheritance model my
hierarchy is grows wide and tall

00:05:18.746 --> 00:05:20.146 A:middle
as my game gets more complex.

00:05:20.556 --> 00:05:22.816 A:middle
With entities and
components it just grows wider

00:05:23.496 --> 00:05:25.286 A:middle
in that width is no
longer a detriment.

00:05:25.646 --> 00:05:26.826 A:middle
It's really a toolbox.

00:05:27.836 --> 00:05:29.876 A:middle
Any time I want to make a new
entity in the game I simply look

00:05:29.876 --> 00:05:31.206 A:middle
at the components
I have available,

00:05:31.606 --> 00:05:34.156 A:middle
choose the appropriate ones or
perhaps implement a new one.

00:05:34.206 --> 00:05:37.806 A:middle
And with entities and components
we get really easy access

00:05:37.866 --> 00:05:38.986 A:middle
to dynamic behavior.

00:05:39.676 --> 00:05:41.206 A:middle
Let's think back to the
tower defense example.

00:05:41.206 --> 00:05:43.956 A:middle
Perhaps I want to implement a
magic spell that roots archers

00:05:43.956 --> 00:05:45.416 A:middle
to the ground so they
can no longer move.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.646 A:middle
One way to represent
this might be

00:05:47.646 --> 00:05:49.916 A:middle
to simply temporarily
remove it's MoveComponent.

00:05:50.376 --> 00:05:52.016 A:middle
This implicitly tells
the rest of my game

00:05:52.376 --> 00:05:53.526 A:middle
that it can no longer move.

00:05:53.606 --> 00:05:56.026 A:middle
And I get the added benefit of
the rest of my game not needing

00:05:56.026 --> 00:05:58.006 A:middle
to know the intimate
details of magic spells.

00:05:58.006 --> 00:06:01.286 A:middle
So let's go ahead and take
a look at the classes.



00:05:58.006 --> 00:06:01.286 A:middle
So let's go ahead and take
a look at the classes.

00:06:02.116 --> 00:06:03.336 A:middle
Here we have GKEntity.

00:06:03.336 --> 00:06:04.956 A:middle
This is our entity base class,

00:06:04.956 --> 00:06:07.336 A:middle
and it's really just a simple
collection of components.

00:06:07.856 --> 00:06:10.886 A:middle
It has the functions to add and
remove components dynamically,

00:06:11.176 --> 00:06:13.396 A:middle
as my entities functionality
undoubtedly changes.

00:06:14.256 --> 00:06:17.146 A:middle
Also let's me access existing
components by unique class type.

00:06:17.976 --> 00:06:20.186 A:middle
When I call update on
my GKEntity it's going

00:06:20.186 --> 00:06:22.546 A:middle
to automatically update all
of the components that it has.

00:06:23.596 --> 00:06:25.876 A:middle
So thinking back to that
example, projectile, tower,

00:06:25.876 --> 00:06:27.896 A:middle
and archer would
all be GKEntities.

00:06:28.386 --> 00:06:33.056 A:middle
Here we have our
GKComponent class.

00:06:33.216 --> 00:06:35.136 A:middle
Now you subclass this
any time you want

00:06:35.136 --> 00:06:37.616 A:middle
to add those singular bits of
functionality to your game.

00:06:37.656 --> 00:06:39.056 A:middle
And you do that in
a number of ways.

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:42.356 A:middle
Properties on your components
become state information

00:06:42.396 --> 00:06:43.276 A:middle
about those components.

00:06:43.276 --> 00:06:45.666 A:middle
So you can imagine the
ShootComponent here would likely

00:06:45.666 --> 00:06:46.706 A:middle
have a damage property

00:06:46.956 --> 00:06:49.046 A:middle
that describes how much
damage it's projectiles do.

00:06:49.866 --> 00:06:51.836 A:middle
You also implement
custom selectors

00:06:51.836 --> 00:06:54.556 A:middle
that extend functionally and
tell the rest of your game how

00:06:54.556 --> 00:06:55.786 A:middle
to communicate with
your component.

00:06:56.796 --> 00:06:59.036 A:middle
So the MoveComponent here for
example would likely have a move

00:06:59.036 --> 00:07:01.396 A:middle
to position function that
you would call from the input



00:06:59.036 --> 00:07:01.396 A:middle
to position function that
you would call from the input

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:02.966 A:middle
or game controller code.

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:06.296 A:middle
As I mentioned before components
are automatically updated

00:07:06.296 --> 00:07:09.116 A:middle
by their entity's update and
you can optionally implement any

00:07:09.116 --> 00:07:11.466 A:middle
time based logic in
updateWithDeltaTime.

00:07:14.236 --> 00:07:17.246 A:middle
So undoubtedly a need will arise
where you need finer control

00:07:17.666 --> 00:07:19.826 A:middle
over the order or how
your components update,

00:07:19.826 --> 00:07:22.316 A:middle
and for that we're
providing GKComponentSystem.

00:07:22.736 --> 00:07:24.606 A:middle
This is a collection
of components

00:07:24.606 --> 00:07:28.776 A:middle
from different entities, but
they're all the same class type.

00:07:28.936 --> 00:07:31.836 A:middle
And you use this when update
order is somehow intrinsically

00:07:31.836 --> 00:07:32.646 A:middle
important to your game.

00:07:33.076 --> 00:07:35.376 A:middle
Perhaps I want to update
AI after my movement code

00:07:35.376 --> 00:07:37.056 A:middle
because I want my AI
to deal with the most

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:39.366 A:middle
up to date position
information available.

00:07:40.466 --> 00:07:42.686 A:middle
And it's important to note that
the components that are placed

00:07:42.686 --> 00:07:44.616 A:middle
in these component
systems no longer update

00:07:44.616 --> 00:07:45.586 A:middle
with their entities update.

00:07:45.826 --> 00:07:48.246 A:middle
It is up to you to call the
component systems update

00:07:48.416 --> 00:07:50.586 A:middle
at the correct time to
update all these entities.

00:07:51.416 --> 00:07:53.106 A:middle
So thinking back to
our example again,

00:07:53.416 --> 00:07:55.436 A:middle
we probably have a
move system which would

00:07:55.436 --> 00:07:57.816 A:middle
in turn have all the move
components in my game,

00:07:58.326 --> 00:07:59.946 A:middle
and I can use that to
synchronize the movement

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:01.446 A:middle
between my various entities.



00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:01.446 A:middle
between my various entities.

00:08:02.046 --> 00:08:06.636 A:middle
So lastly we have a code
example of what using entities

00:08:06.636 --> 00:08:08.466 A:middle
and components in
GameplayKit looks like.

00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:10.926 A:middle
You see at the top here I'm
going to make my archer entity,

00:08:10.926 --> 00:08:13.426 A:middle
and then I'm going to make
the three components that make

00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:15.636 A:middle
up being an archer:
the MoveComponent,

00:08:15.736 --> 00:08:17.536 A:middle
the ShootComponent, and
the TargetComponent.

00:08:17.846 --> 00:08:19.056 A:middle
And add those to my archer.

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:22.336 A:middle
Then I'm going to make that
moveSystem we talked about,

00:08:22.366 --> 00:08:24.026 A:middle
passing in the MoveComponent's
class,

00:08:24.026 --> 00:08:26.686 A:middle
indicating this component system
only deals with MoveComponents.

00:08:28.006 --> 00:08:29.556 A:middle
Then I'm going to add my
archer's MoveComponent

00:08:29.556 --> 00:08:31.546 A:middle
to that moveSystem
and I'm good to go.

00:08:31.546 --> 00:08:34.265 A:middle
This archer and moveSystem
are ready for use in my game.

00:08:34.826 --> 00:08:39.596 A:middle
So that's entities
and components.

00:08:39.596 --> 00:08:41.666 A:middle
So let's move on
to state machines.

00:08:41.836 --> 00:08:45.076 A:middle
I'm going to start with
another example here.

00:08:45.326 --> 00:08:47.546 A:middle
Let's imagine some game where
the player is being chased

00:08:47.546 --> 00:08:50.556 A:middle
by ghosts, and sometimes he gets
to take a power-up and chase,

00:08:50.556 --> 00:08:52.096 A:middle
and maybe defeat
the ghosts instead.

00:08:52.876 --> 00:08:55.826 A:middle
Here's an example of what
a state machine to control

00:08:55.826 --> 00:08:57.026 A:middle
that ghost might look like.

00:08:57.446 --> 00:08:59.816 A:middle
You see here we have
the four states

00:08:59.816 --> 00:09:00.836 A:middle
that a ghost can ever be in,



00:08:59.816 --> 00:09:00.836 A:middle
that a ghost can ever be in,

00:09:01.246 --> 00:09:02.966 A:middle
chase for when the ghost
is chasing the player,

00:09:03.766 --> 00:09:05.456 A:middle
flee for when the player
is chasing the ghost,

00:09:06.066 --> 00:09:08.566 A:middle
defeated for when the ghost
gets caught and gets defeated,

00:09:09.236 --> 00:09:12.546 A:middle
and respawn sometime after the
ghost is defeated before it

00:09:12.546 --> 00:09:13.236 A:middle
comes back to life.

00:09:13.376 --> 00:09:15.866 A:middle
Now it's important to
note here that only some

00:09:15.866 --> 00:09:17.446 A:middle
of these state transitions
are valid.

00:09:18.306 --> 00:09:20.806 A:middle
You see I move between chase
and flee interchangeably here.

00:09:20.806 --> 00:09:22.726 A:middle
This makes sense based on
the game I just described,

00:09:22.966 --> 00:09:24.416 A:middle
sometimes the ghost
does the chasing

00:09:24.416 --> 00:09:26.356 A:middle
and sometimes the
player does the chasing.

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:29.526 A:middle
And of course we only go
to defeated from flee,

00:09:29.526 --> 00:09:31.456 A:middle
this is the only time that the
player can actually defeat the

00:09:31.456 --> 00:09:33.636 A:middle
ghost, when he has that power-up
and is chasing the ghost.

00:09:34.246 --> 00:09:37.056 A:middle
Then we go from respawn to
defeated, this again makes sense

00:09:37.356 --> 00:09:39.286 A:middle
and after we respawn
we go right into chase.

00:09:39.316 --> 00:09:40.306 A:middle
This is our initial state.

00:09:40.306 --> 00:09:42.256 A:middle
After ghosts respawn,
they go right back

00:09:42.316 --> 00:09:43.266 A:middle
to chasing the player.

00:09:43.866 --> 00:09:48.526 A:middle
So why are state machines so
important in game development?

00:09:49.236 --> 00:09:50.996 A:middle
Well for a lot of games
they're the backbone

00:09:50.996 --> 00:09:52.346 A:middle
of many gameplay elements.

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:55.476 A:middle
A ton of our common gameplay
elements are full of state,

00:09:55.516 --> 00:09:58.966 A:middle
things like animation,
AI, UI, levels.



00:10:00.436 --> 00:10:02.256 A:middle
Anyone who's tried to bring
life to a humanoid character

00:10:02.256 --> 00:10:03.466 A:middle
in a game is undoubtedly
familiar

00:10:03.466 --> 00:10:04.456 A:middle
with the state machine
on the right.

00:10:04.926 --> 00:10:06.236 A:middle
We usually have an
IdleAnimation,

00:10:06.326 --> 00:10:08.466 A:middle
and a MoveAnimation,
and an AttackAnimation,

00:10:08.736 --> 00:10:10.336 A:middle
and move between them
in meaningful ways.

00:10:10.886 --> 00:10:15.656 A:middle
So because this pattern is
so pervasive in our code,

00:10:15.806 --> 00:10:17.876 A:middle
we reimplemented it a lot, to
what amounts to little more

00:10:17.876 --> 00:10:19.666 A:middle
than boilerplate, and
this take the form

00:10:19.666 --> 00:10:22.026 A:middle
of really big switch
statements or if else trees.

00:10:23.386 --> 00:10:25.676 A:middle
What if you could come up with
some common implementation

00:10:25.676 --> 00:10:28.836 A:middle
to remove that boilerplate, add
a little bit of maintainability,

00:10:29.046 --> 00:10:31.156 A:middle
and give us the benefit of
being able to reuse our states

00:10:31.276 --> 00:10:32.566 A:middle
and state machines
throughout our game.

00:10:33.406 --> 00:10:34.926 A:middle
That's what we've
done in GameplayKit.

00:10:35.736 --> 00:10:36.856 A:middle
So let's take a look
at the classes.

00:10:37.966 --> 00:10:39.576 A:middle
Here we have GKStateMachine.

00:10:39.836 --> 00:10:42.106 A:middle
This is your general
purpose finite state machine.

00:10:42.106 --> 00:10:43.856 A:middle
And what I mean by
that is it's in one,

00:10:43.856 --> 00:10:45.676 A:middle
and only one state at any given.

00:10:45.746 --> 00:10:49.946 A:middle
And it possesses all of the
states that it can ever be in.

00:10:50.326 --> 00:10:52.386 A:middle
You call enterState
on our state machines

00:10:52.446 --> 00:10:54.516 A:middle
to cause those state
transitions I was talking about.

00:10:54.976 --> 00:10:56.796 A:middle
And what happens under
the hood, is it checks

00:10:56.796 --> 00:10:59.576 A:middle
if that transition is valid,
and if so, makes that change.



00:11:00.246 --> 00:11:02.746 A:middle
And it calls a number of call
backs on the state objects.

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:06.016 A:middle
We exit the state we were in, we
enter the state we're going to,

00:11:06.206 --> 00:11:08.366 A:middle
and we update the current state
that the state machine is in.

00:11:09.236 --> 00:11:10.856 A:middle
So in that ghost example
we'd probably have

00:11:10.856 --> 00:11:11.766 A:middle
a GhostStateMachine.

00:11:11.996 --> 00:11:14.206 A:middle
It would in turn have those four
states we were talking about.

00:11:14.706 --> 00:11:19.486 A:middle
Here we have our
GKState abstract class.

00:11:20.016 --> 00:11:22.266 A:middle
And you implement
your state based logic

00:11:22.626 --> 00:11:23.616 A:middle
in a number of callbacks.

00:11:23.696 --> 00:11:25.776 A:middle
We give you an enter callback
when the state is being entered,

00:11:26.016 --> 00:11:27.926 A:middle
an exit callback when
we're leaving the state,

00:11:28.136 --> 00:11:29.996 A:middle
and an update callback when
this is the current state

00:11:29.996 --> 00:11:30.706 A:middle
in the state machine.

00:11:30.886 --> 00:11:32.766 A:middle
As I mentioned before,
they're automatically called

00:11:32.766 --> 00:11:34.416 A:middle
by the state machine at
the appropriate time.

00:11:35.176 --> 00:11:37.956 A:middle
You can optionally override
the isValidNextState function

00:11:38.256 --> 00:11:39.896 A:middle
to control the edges
of your state graph,

00:11:39.896 --> 00:11:41.726 A:middle
those valid transitions
I was talking about.

00:11:41.766 --> 00:11:44.236 A:middle
Now by default, all of
these edges are valid

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:46.696 A:middle
but undoubtedly you'll want
to use the dynamic internals

00:11:46.696 --> 00:11:49.766 A:middle
of your states to decide which
of those transitions are valid.

00:11:50.936 --> 00:11:53.456 A:middle
So these four ghost states we
talked about: chase, defeated,

00:11:53.456 --> 00:11:56.256 A:middle
flee, respawn would all be
implemented as GKStates.

00:11:56.256 --> 00:12:00.126 A:middle
So I want to end
on an example here.



00:11:56.256 --> 00:12:00.126 A:middle
So I want to end
on an example here.

00:12:01.316 --> 00:12:01.786 A:middle
Let's implement

00:12:01.786 --> 00:12:03.486 A:middle
that GhostStateMachine
we just talked about.

00:12:03.936 --> 00:12:06.326 A:middle
At the top here I'm going to go
ahead and make my four states:

00:12:06.676 --> 00:12:09.076 A:middle
chase, flee, defeated,
and respawn.

00:12:10.006 --> 00:12:12.146 A:middle
Then I'm going to make
my state machine passing

00:12:12.146 --> 00:12:13.906 A:middle
in those four states,
those are the four states

00:12:13.906 --> 00:12:15.266 A:middle
that the state machine
can ever be in.

00:12:16.256 --> 00:12:18.296 A:middle
Then I'm going to go ahead
and enter the initial state

00:12:18.416 --> 00:12:19.746 A:middle
which is chase in this example.

00:12:20.036 --> 00:12:20.626 A:middle
We're good to go.

00:12:20.626 --> 00:12:22.406 A:middle
This state machine is
ready for use in our game,

00:12:22.406 --> 00:12:28.086 A:middle
and that ghost is going to
do exactly what we expect.

00:12:28.086 --> 00:12:28.966 A:middle
So that's state machines,

00:12:29.996 --> 00:12:32.196 A:middle
let's move on to agents,
goals, and behaviors.

00:12:32.196 --> 00:12:35.796 A:middle
So some concepts
before we get started.

00:12:36.846 --> 00:12:39.616 A:middle
What we call agents,
goals, and behaviors,

00:12:39.916 --> 00:12:43.326 A:middle
are really autonomously moving
entities, they're controlled

00:12:43.396 --> 00:12:45.436 A:middle
by realistic behaviors
and goals.

00:12:45.816 --> 00:12:48.456 A:middle
They have a number of physical
constraints, things like masks,

00:12:48.646 --> 00:12:50.166 A:middle
acceleration, and inertia.

00:12:50.756 --> 00:12:53.856 A:middle
The behaviors that control
these agents are in turn made

00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:56.046 A:middle
up of a number of
goals, that you combine

00:12:56.046 --> 00:12:57.016 A:middle
with the appropriate weights,

00:12:57.306 --> 00:13:00.366 A:middle
to achieve some meaningful
autonomous movement functionally



00:12:57.306 --> 00:13:00.366 A:middle
to achieve some meaningful
autonomous movement functionally

00:13:00.366 --> 00:13:03.826 A:middle
in your game.

00:13:04.016 --> 00:13:06.356 A:middle
So why are agents so
important in game development?

00:13:06.356 --> 00:13:08.156 A:middle
I think a lot of games benefit

00:13:08.156 --> 00:13:10.626 A:middle
from really believable
realistic movement.

00:13:11.246 --> 00:13:12.926 A:middle
When our game entities
move in straight lines

00:13:13.306 --> 00:13:15.846 A:middle
and take turns instantly
and bump into obstacles

00:13:15.976 --> 00:13:18.046 A:middle
in our environment, it
doesn't look very real.

00:13:19.096 --> 00:13:20.936 A:middle
Movement in the real world
has things like inertia,

00:13:21.336 --> 00:13:22.546 A:middle
and mass, and acceleration.

00:13:23.106 --> 00:13:24.826 A:middle
And it correctly
avoids nearby obstacles

00:13:24.826 --> 00:13:25.946 A:middle
as well as other entities.

00:13:27.156 --> 00:13:28.636 A:middle
And when entities know
how to get from point A

00:13:28.746 --> 00:13:31.076 A:middle
to B they usually follow a
path, and they usually do

00:13:31.076 --> 00:13:32.656 A:middle
so smoothly rather than rigidly.

00:13:33.246 --> 00:13:37.696 A:middle
So here's an overview
of what we're giving you

00:13:37.696 --> 00:13:38.606 A:middle
in our agent system.

00:13:38.976 --> 00:13:41.706 A:middle
We have our Agent class, it
is controlled by a behavior

00:13:41.706 --> 00:13:43.876 A:middle
and it also has a delegate
that let's you respond

00:13:43.876 --> 00:13:44.896 A:middle
to changes in the agent.

00:13:46.196 --> 00:13:48.656 A:middle
These behaviors are in turn
made up of a number of goals

00:13:48.656 --> 00:13:50.056 A:middle
that you combine with
weights to achieve

00:13:50.056 --> 00:13:51.206 A:middle
that meaningful functionality.

00:13:51.996 --> 00:13:54.226 A:middle
You have a lot of goals at your
disposal: things like seeking,

00:13:54.226 --> 00:13:57.116 A:middle
and intercepting, avoiding
obstacles, and following paths.

00:13:57.586 --> 00:14:01.826 A:middle
Let's go ahead and take
a look at the classes.



00:13:57.586 --> 00:14:01.826 A:middle
Let's go ahead and take
a look at the classes.

00:14:02.596 --> 00:14:05.236 A:middle
GKAgent is a simple
autonomous point mass

00:14:05.686 --> 00:14:08.106 A:middle
and it's also a GKComponent
so it plays really nice

00:14:08.106 --> 00:14:09.406 A:middle
with our entity and
component systems.

00:14:09.806 --> 00:14:12.606 A:middle
And when you call update
on GKAgent it's going

00:14:12.606 --> 00:14:14.556 A:middle
to apply its current
behavior and what that does

00:14:14.556 --> 00:14:16.866 A:middle
under the hood it's going to
look at the goals that make

00:14:16.866 --> 00:14:19.566 A:middle
up its behavior,
and calculate along

00:14:19.566 --> 00:14:22.536 A:middle
with the weights some total
change in acceleration necessary

00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:25.456 A:middle
to simultaneously meet
those goals as best it can.

00:14:26.826 --> 00:14:28.596 A:middle
It then uses that
change in acceleration

00:14:29.156 --> 00:14:31.986 A:middle
to change the agents velocity
and position in rotation.

00:14:33.426 --> 00:14:34.516 A:middle
Now GKAgent has a had lot

00:14:34.516 --> 00:14:36.526 A:middle
of those physical constraints I
talked about, things like mass,

00:14:36.946 --> 00:14:39.646 A:middle
and A bounding radius, max
speed, max acceleration.

00:14:40.026 --> 00:14:42.716 A:middle
It is important to note that
these units are dimensionless

00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:44.476 A:middle
and very likely to be
game world specific.

00:14:45.256 --> 00:14:47.636 A:middle
So you can imagine a game on
the scale of kilometers is going

00:14:47.636 --> 00:14:49.046 A:middle
to have vastly different
numbers here

00:14:49.646 --> 00:14:51.136 A:middle
than a game that's
on the scale of feet.

00:14:51.826 --> 00:14:53.256 A:middle
So make sure you choose
the appropriate numbers

00:14:53.256 --> 00:14:54.166 A:middle
for your game world here.

00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:58.476 A:middle
Here we have our
GKBehavior class.

00:14:58.476 --> 00:15:00.306 A:middle
And it's a simple
dictionary-like container



00:14:58.476 --> 00:15:00.306 A:middle
And it's a simple
dictionary-like container

00:15:00.306 --> 00:15:01.146 A:middle
of those goals.

00:15:01.766 --> 00:15:03.606 A:middle
It let's you dynamically
modify the behavior

00:15:03.896 --> 00:15:06.486 A:middle
as your game undoubtedly
changes, and you do this

00:15:06.486 --> 00:15:09.926 A:middle
by adding new behaviors,
adding new goals,

00:15:10.296 --> 00:15:11.416 A:middle
removing existing goals,

00:15:11.566 --> 00:15:13.436 A:middle
and modifying the
weights on existing goals.

00:15:14.106 --> 00:15:16.396 A:middle
As I mentioned before, you
set a behavior on an agent

00:15:16.496 --> 00:15:17.486 A:middle
and that agent is good to go.

00:15:17.586 --> 00:15:19.056 A:middle
The next time you
update that agent,

00:15:19.056 --> 00:15:21.686 A:middle
it's going to correctly
attempt to follow that behavior.

00:15:22.596 --> 00:15:24.656 A:middle
So some examples of
what behaviors might be,

00:15:24.656 --> 00:15:26.316 A:middle
perhaps you want to
implement a flocking behavior,

00:15:26.696 --> 00:15:28.666 A:middle
to simulate the flocking
of birds in real life.

00:15:29.296 --> 00:15:32.076 A:middle
We may combine a cohere, a
separate, and an align goal

00:15:32.366 --> 00:15:34.406 A:middle
with the appropriate
weights to achieve that.

00:15:34.986 --> 00:15:36.996 A:middle
Or maybe I'm making a
racing game and want

00:15:36.996 --> 00:15:38.886 A:middle
to make a racing behavior
to control my race cars.

00:15:39.396 --> 00:15:41.556 A:middle
This might be as simple as
combining a follow path,

00:15:41.556 --> 00:15:43.426 A:middle
I want my race car to
follow the race track,

00:15:44.006 --> 00:15:46.376 A:middle
and an avoid other agents
goal, I want my race car

00:15:46.376 --> 00:15:48.366 A:middle
to avoid colliding with
the other race cars.

00:15:48.366 --> 00:15:53.066 A:middle
Here's a code example much
what making these behaviors

00:15:53.066 --> 00:15:53.446 A:middle
looks like.

00:15:54.226 --> 00:15:55.876 A:middle
You see the top, I'm going
to make a seek behavior,

00:15:55.876 --> 00:15:58.046 A:middle
I want to seek some enemy
agent in my environment.

00:15:58.046 --> 00:16:00.516 A:middle
I'm going to make an avoid goal,



00:15:58.046 --> 00:16:00.516 A:middle
I'm going to make an avoid goal,

00:16:00.516 --> 00:16:02.216 A:middle
I want to avoid nearby
obstacles.

00:16:02.656 --> 00:16:04.046 A:middle
Then I'm going to make
a targetSpeed goal.

00:16:04.206 --> 00:16:07.646 A:middle
I want my agent to accelerate
to and reach some target speed.

00:16:08.236 --> 00:16:10.276 A:middle
Then I'm going to make
my behavior passing

00:16:10.276 --> 00:16:12.846 A:middle
in those three goals with an
appropriate set of weights.

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:15.276 A:middle
You see here I'm weighting
the avoid goal at a 5

00:16:15.276 --> 00:16:17.096 A:middle
because I definitely don't
want my agent to collide

00:16:17.096 --> 00:16:18.126 A:middle
with nearby obstacles.

00:16:19.056 --> 00:16:22.676 A:middle
Then I'm going to make my agent,
initialize it, set the behavior

00:16:22.676 --> 00:16:24.436 A:middle
on it, and this agent
is good to go.

00:16:24.496 --> 00:16:26.426 A:middle
The next time I call update
on this agent it's going

00:16:26.426 --> 00:16:28.356 A:middle
to correctly do what I expect.

00:16:28.356 --> 00:16:32.856 A:middle
So let's talk a little
about that agent delegate.

00:16:33.656 --> 00:16:36.746 A:middle
GKAgentDelegate is useful when
you need to sync your visuals,

00:16:36.836 --> 00:16:39.266 A:middle
things like graphics,
animation, physics,

00:16:39.616 --> 00:16:41.436 A:middle
with this underlying
agent simulation.

00:16:42.216 --> 00:16:43.866 A:middle
We give you two callbacks
to do that.

00:16:44.346 --> 00:16:47.296 A:middle
agentWillUpdate, which is called
before any updates are applied

00:16:47.296 --> 00:16:47.756 A:middle
to the agent.

00:16:48.416 --> 00:16:49.676 A:middle
And agentDidUpdate,
which is called

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:50.876 A:middle
after the updates are applied.

00:16:51.676 --> 00:16:54.806 A:middle
In your game this might be
things like a SpriteKit node,

00:16:55.226 --> 00:16:57.576 A:middle
or a SceneKit node,
or a render component.

00:16:58.086 --> 00:17:01.566 A:middle
Let's take a look at what
this delegation looks



00:16:58.086 --> 00:17:01.566 A:middle
Let's take a look at what
this delegation looks

00:17:01.566 --> 00:17:02.766 A:middle
like in a SpriteKit game.

00:17:03.486 --> 00:17:05.925 A:middle
You see here I have a custom
sprite node MyAgentSpriteNode

00:17:06.326 --> 00:17:07.915 A:middle
and I'm going to go
ahead and implement both

00:17:07.915 --> 00:17:09.786 A:middle
of those callbacks
that I talked about.

00:17:10.516 --> 00:17:13.816 A:middle
In agentWillUpdate, I'll set the
agent's position in rotation,

00:17:13.976 --> 00:17:15.796 A:middle
equal to my node's
position in rotation,

00:17:15.976 --> 00:17:18.685 A:middle
I want that underlying agent
simulation to match my visuals.

00:17:19.915 --> 00:17:21.116 A:middle
Then we are going
to do some updating.

00:17:21.215 --> 00:17:23.715 A:middle
And then an agentDidUpdate,
I'm going to do the inverse,

00:17:23.715 --> 00:17:25.866 A:middle
I'm going to set my node's
position in rotation,

00:17:26.205 --> 00:17:28.646 A:middle
equal to my agent's position in
rotation, the visuals will match

00:17:28.646 --> 00:17:30.376 A:middle
that underlying agent
simulation again.

00:17:30.906 --> 00:17:34.836 A:middle
Now I would like to
give you a quick demo

00:17:35.456 --> 00:17:37.676 A:middle
on what agent movement
looks look and some

00:17:37.746 --> 00:17:40.766 A:middle
of the goals you have
at your disposal.

00:17:49.066 --> 00:17:50.906 A:middle
So here I have a simple
SpriteKit scene and we're going

00:17:50.906 --> 00:17:53.296 A:middle
to represent the agents
with a triangle in a circle.

00:17:53.686 --> 00:17:55.196 A:middle
They're oriented where
the triangle is pointing.

00:17:56.186 --> 00:17:57.386 A:middle
Here I have a seat goal.

00:17:57.846 --> 00:17:59.436 A:middle
The agent in the center
is simply going to try

00:17:59.436 --> 00:18:00.716 A:middle
to seek my mouse position.



00:17:59.436 --> 00:18:00.716 A:middle
to seek my mouse position.

00:18:01.776 --> 00:18:04.126 A:middle
Notice how fluid and realistic
the movement looks, because he's

00:18:04.126 --> 00:18:06.586 A:middle
under those realistic physical
constraints, things like mass,

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:08.016 A:middle
and acceleration, and inertia.

00:18:13.796 --> 00:18:15.946 A:middle
Here we have an example of
the inverse, a flee goal.

00:18:16.066 --> 00:18:17.816 A:middle
The agent is going to
instead attempt to run away

00:18:17.816 --> 00:18:19.036 A:middle
from the mouse position.

00:18:25.416 --> 00:18:27.156 A:middle
Here is an example
of a wander behavior.

00:18:27.716 --> 00:18:29.186 A:middle
My agent is just going
to randomly wander

00:18:29.186 --> 00:18:33.886 A:middle
about the environment making
random left and right turns.

00:18:39.296 --> 00:18:41.906 A:middle
Here we have an example of
an obstacle avoidance goal.

00:18:42.136 --> 00:18:43.356 A:middle
Once again my agent
is going to attempt

00:18:43.356 --> 00:18:44.456 A:middle
to seek the mouse position

00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:46.696 A:middle
but I have added a couple
circle obstacles to my scene,

00:18:47.066 --> 00:18:48.716 A:middle
and he has an obstacle
avoidance goal on him.

00:18:49.066 --> 00:18:51.246 A:middle
So while he's still trying
to seek the mouse position,

00:18:51.246 --> 00:18:53.506 A:middle
he's also going to avoid
colliding with the obstacles.



00:19:02.236 --> 00:19:04.396 A:middle
Here I have an example
of a separation goal.

00:19:04.396 --> 00:19:06.126 A:middle
I have three agents that
are once again going to try

00:19:06.126 --> 00:19:07.086 A:middle
to seek the mouse position.

00:19:07.316 --> 00:19:09.006 A:middle
But they also have a
separation goal on them.

00:19:09.286 --> 00:19:11.296 A:middle
They're going to try to
maintain some minimum separation

00:19:11.296 --> 00:19:11.746 A:middle
between them.

00:19:11.746 --> 00:19:14.946 A:middle
And this is really useful for
things like formation flying

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:22.316 A:middle
or keeping groups of units
together in your game.

00:19:22.516 --> 00:19:24.136 A:middle
Here I have an example
of an alignment goal.

00:19:24.446 --> 00:19:25.886 A:middle
The agent on the right
is simply going to try

00:19:25.886 --> 00:19:28.166 A:middle
to match the heading of
the agent on the left.

00:19:29.076 --> 00:19:30.556 A:middle
This is really useful for things

00:19:30.556 --> 00:19:32.546 A:middle
like synchronizing
units in your game.

00:19:40.276 --> 00:19:42.586 A:middle
Here I have an example
of a flocking goal.

00:19:43.316 --> 00:19:45.556 A:middle
Here we have our leader agent
in the red which is just going

00:19:45.556 --> 00:19:46.486 A:middle
to wander about the scene.

00:19:47.016 --> 00:19:49.176 A:middle
But I also have a group
of these blue agents

00:19:49.176 --> 00:19:50.276 A:middle
under a flocking behavior.

00:19:50.276 --> 00:19:52.826 A:middle
They are combining a cohere,
a separate, and an align goal

00:19:53.036 --> 00:19:54.946 A:middle
to stay in a blob,
while also trying

00:19:54.946 --> 00:19:56.676 A:middle
to chase that leader entity.

00:19:57.046 --> 00:19:59.196 A:middle
So the separate goal is
maintaining some minimum

00:19:59.196 --> 00:20:00.136 A:middle
separation between them,



00:19:59.196 --> 00:20:00.136 A:middle
separation between them,

00:20:00.336 --> 00:20:03.456 A:middle
the cohere goal makes them stay
together in a cohesive mass,

00:20:03.456 --> 00:20:05.086 A:middle
and the alignment
goal wants them

00:20:05.086 --> 00:20:07.076 A:middle
to reach an average heading.

00:20:10.796 --> 00:20:14.146 A:middle
Last thing I have an example
of a follow path behavior here.

00:20:14.146 --> 00:20:16.706 A:middle
I have a simple polyline
path and my agent is going

00:20:16.706 --> 00:20:18.286 A:middle
to attempt to follow it.

00:20:18.286 --> 00:20:20.326 A:middle
Now I want you to notice
that he doesn't take the

00:20:20.576 --> 00:20:21.556 A:middle
corners sharply.

00:20:22.256 --> 00:20:24.076 A:middle
He's under those realistic
physical constraints we talked

00:20:24.076 --> 00:20:25.856 A:middle
about, things like
mass and acceleration.

00:20:26.136 --> 00:20:27.426 A:middle
So he's forced to follow it

00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:30.266 A:middle
in a smooth manner even though
the underlying path itself

00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:30.906 A:middle
is rigid.

00:20:36.836 --> 00:20:39.666 A:middle
So that's agents,
goals, and behaviors.

00:20:40.516 --> 00:20:48.816 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:49.316 --> 00:20:50.696 A:middle
Let's go ahead and
move on to pathfinding.

00:20:51.346 --> 00:20:54.216 A:middle
Now I'm sure we're familiar

00:20:54.216 --> 00:20:55.656 A:middle
with this problem
in game development.

00:20:55.726 --> 00:20:58.266 A:middle
I have some entity in my
game world that wants to get

00:20:58.266 --> 00:21:00.766 A:middle
from point A to B, but there
is an obstacle in my way.



00:20:58.266 --> 00:21:00.766 A:middle
from point A to B, but there
is an obstacle in my way.

00:21:01.826 --> 00:21:03.836 A:middle
I don't want the entity to
move through the obstacle.

00:21:03.836 --> 00:21:05.986 A:middle
I don't want her to
bump into the obstacle.

00:21:05.986 --> 00:21:08.036 A:middle
I want her to correctly
find a path

00:21:08.036 --> 00:21:09.856 A:middle
around the obstacle
like a human would.

00:21:11.166 --> 00:21:13.756 A:middle
What I'm looking for here
is something like this:

00:21:13.886 --> 00:21:15.796 A:middle
I want her to correctly
find the shortest way

00:21:15.796 --> 00:21:17.776 A:middle
around the obstacle,
clear the obstacle,

00:21:18.146 --> 00:21:19.216 A:middle
and continue on to my goal.

00:21:19.766 --> 00:21:24.316 A:middle
This is the realm of problems
we call in gameplay pathfinding.

00:21:25.196 --> 00:21:29.256 A:middle
Now some concepts before we get
started, pathfinding operates

00:21:29.256 --> 00:21:30.466 A:middle
on a navigation graph.

00:21:30.976 --> 00:21:33.516 A:middle
In this navigation graph,
it is a collection of nodes

00:21:33.516 --> 00:21:35.876 A:middle
that describe the passable
areas in your game world.

00:21:36.086 --> 00:21:39.396 A:middle
The places where my entities
are allowed to be and move.

00:21:39.686 --> 00:21:41.696 A:middle
These nodes are in turn
joined by connections

00:21:41.696 --> 00:21:44.776 A:middle
to describe how my entities move
between these passable areas.

00:21:45.226 --> 00:21:47.316 A:middle
And these connections
can be single directional

00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:51.426 A:middle
or bidirectional, and there is
always exists an optimal path

00:21:51.486 --> 00:21:53.776 A:middle
between any two nodes
in a connected graph.

00:21:53.866 --> 00:21:55.686 A:middle
And this is usually
the path we're looking

00:21:55.686 --> 00:21:56.846 A:middle
for in pathfinding.

00:21:56.846 --> 00:22:00.536 A:middle
So let's go ahead and take
a look at the classes.



00:21:56.846 --> 00:22:00.536 A:middle
So let's go ahead and take
a look at the classes.

00:22:01.076 --> 00:22:04.866 A:middle
Here we have GKGraph, which is
our abstract graph base class,

00:22:05.206 --> 00:22:07.866 A:middle
it's quite simply a container of
graph nodes, those descriptions

00:22:07.866 --> 00:22:09.666 A:middle
of the passable areas
in my game world.

00:22:10.236 --> 00:22:13.336 A:middle
It has the functions necessary
to add and remove nodes

00:22:13.336 --> 00:22:15.066 A:middle
as the game world
undoubtedly changes,

00:22:15.486 --> 00:22:17.756 A:middle
and it also lets me connect
new nodes to the graph,

00:22:17.756 --> 00:22:19.106 A:middle
making the appropriate
connections

00:22:19.106 --> 00:22:20.676 A:middle
to existing nodes
I would expect.

00:22:21.746 --> 00:22:23.596 A:middle
Add of course we also
let you find paths

00:22:23.656 --> 00:22:25.126 A:middle
between nodes and a graph.

00:22:25.816 --> 00:22:28.016 A:middle
And we're offering you
guy's two specializations,

00:22:28.486 --> 00:22:30.816 A:middle
a GKGraph that works
with grids, and a GKGraph

00:22:30.816 --> 00:22:31.816 A:middle
that works with obstacles.

00:22:31.816 --> 00:22:33.676 A:middle
Let's talk a little bit
more about those now.

00:22:34.216 --> 00:22:35.986 A:middle
All right.

00:22:36.196 --> 00:22:37.306 A:middle
GKGridGraph.

00:22:37.346 --> 00:22:39.886 A:middle
This is our GK graph that's
specialized for a 2D grid.

00:22:40.236 --> 00:22:41.116 A:middle
And what this does,
is it's going

00:22:41.116 --> 00:22:43.836 A:middle
to automatically create all
the nodes to represent a grid

00:22:44.356 --> 00:22:46.676 A:middle
of some given start position
and width and height.

00:22:46.936 --> 00:22:50.086 A:middle
It's going to automatically
make the cardinal connections

00:22:50.086 --> 00:22:50.996 A:middle
between the grid nodes

00:22:51.356 --> 00:22:52.916 A:middle
and optionally the
diagonal ones as well.

00:22:52.916 --> 00:22:55.866 A:middle
And it also has easy
functions available to add

00:22:55.866 --> 00:22:59.096 A:middle
and remove grid spaces as they
undoubtedly become impassable

00:22:59.096 --> 00:23:03.026 A:middle
and passable again in your game.



00:22:59.096 --> 00:23:03.026 A:middle
and passable again in your game.

00:23:03.246 --> 00:23:05.186 A:middle
Next we have our
GKObstacleGraph.

00:23:05.186 --> 00:23:07.976 A:middle
This is a GK graph that's
specialized for pathfinding

00:23:07.976 --> 00:23:09.436 A:middle
around obstacles
in your game world.

00:23:09.436 --> 00:23:12.186 A:middle
And these obstacles can
be any arbitrary polygon.

00:23:12.186 --> 00:23:15.786 A:middle
Now we give you the functions
necessary to dynamically add

00:23:15.786 --> 00:23:17.366 A:middle
and remove obstacles
as your game world,

00:23:17.366 --> 00:23:18.696 A:middle
again, undoubtedly changes.

00:23:18.836 --> 00:23:21.666 A:middle
It also lets you dynamically
connect new nodes to the graph

00:23:21.666 --> 00:23:24.656 A:middle
and this is really useful for
stuff like inserting a start

00:23:24.656 --> 00:23:27.636 A:middle
and an end node in my graph
to find a path for a unit.

00:23:27.636 --> 00:23:30.906 A:middle
Now we do this by what we're
calling a buffer radius,

00:23:30.906 --> 00:23:32.916 A:middle
this is a safety zone
around obstacles,

00:23:33.136 --> 00:23:34.646 A:middle
where my entities are
not allowed to go,

00:23:34.646 --> 00:23:37.286 A:middle
and it's often a
game-dependent size relating

00:23:37.286 --> 00:23:39.046 A:middle
to the bounding radius
of the entities

00:23:39.046 --> 00:23:40.206 A:middle
that I want to do
the navigating.

00:23:41.256 --> 00:23:42.236 A:middle
So let's talk a little more

00:23:42.236 --> 00:23:44.306 A:middle
about how these obstacle
graphs are generated.

00:23:44.886 --> 00:23:47.656 A:middle
So here I have a simple scene
with two square obstacles,

00:23:48.166 --> 00:23:50.406 A:middle
an entity on the lower
left that wants to get

00:23:50.476 --> 00:23:52.026 A:middle
to that bridge on
the lower right.

00:23:52.496 --> 00:23:56.766 A:middle
My entity is bounded by some
bounding radius, and we're going

00:23:56.766 --> 00:23:58.216 A:middle
to use that as our buffer radius

00:23:58.246 --> 00:24:00.296 A:middle
to artificially make
our obstacles larger.



00:23:58.246 --> 00:24:00.296 A:middle
to artificially make
our obstacles larger.

00:24:01.656 --> 00:24:04.186 A:middle
Then under the hood the
obstacle graph is going

00:24:04.186 --> 00:24:05.876 A:middle
to make the appropriate
connections between all

00:24:05.876 --> 00:24:07.826 A:middle
of our grid nodes,
and it's going

00:24:07.826 --> 00:24:09.176 A:middle
to correctly not make the ones

00:24:09.176 --> 00:24:11.806 A:middle
that would violate the
spatiality of our obstacles.

00:24:12.056 --> 00:24:13.556 A:middle
So you see here that we found

00:24:13.556 --> 00:24:14.916 A:middle
that shortest path
we were looking for.

00:24:15.116 --> 00:24:16.986 A:middle
It doesn't collide with
any of my obstacles.

00:24:22.336 --> 00:24:25.066 A:middle
Here is a code example
of that last example,

00:24:25.066 --> 00:24:26.626 A:middle
but with just a single obstacle.

00:24:26.886 --> 00:24:27.696 A:middle
Here at the top I'm going

00:24:27.696 --> 00:24:30.676 A:middle
to make a simple square polygon
obstacle; it's just four points.

00:24:31.646 --> 00:24:33.466 A:middle
Then I'm going to make
our obstacle graph,

00:24:33.536 --> 00:24:35.856 A:middle
passing in our obstacle
and some buffer radius.

00:24:37.366 --> 00:24:38.866 A:middle
Then, I'm going to make
a start and end node.

00:24:39.176 --> 00:24:41.256 A:middle
One for where my hero
currently is and one

00:24:41.256 --> 00:24:42.166 A:middle
for where she wants to go.

00:24:42.166 --> 00:24:45.506 A:middle
Then I'm going to
dynamically connect those nodes

00:24:45.506 --> 00:24:48.476 A:middle
to my obstacle graph using the
obstacles that it possesses.

00:24:48.476 --> 00:24:50.396 A:middle
And what it's going to do is
it's going to insert those nodes

00:24:50.396 --> 00:24:52.436 A:middle
into the graph and again
automatically make the

00:24:52.436 --> 00:24:54.676 A:middle
connections that make
sense, and not make the ones

00:24:54.676 --> 00:24:57.096 A:middle
that would violate the
spatiality of my obstacles.

00:24:57.176 --> 00:25:00.806 A:middle
Then at the end here I'm going
to find a path for my start



00:24:57.176 --> 00:25:00.806 A:middle
Then at the end here I'm going
to find a path for my start

00:25:00.806 --> 00:25:03.756 A:middle
and end node and I get back a
simple NSArray of graph nodes,

00:25:03.756 --> 00:25:10.406 A:middle
which I can then use to
animate my character.

00:25:10.746 --> 00:25:13.546 A:middle
Some advance nodes on our graph
node class which is GKGraphNode,

00:25:13.926 --> 00:25:16.306 A:middle
undoubtedly some need will arise
where you want to subclass this.

00:25:16.306 --> 00:25:19.306 A:middle
And this is really useful for
implementing stuff like advanced

00:25:19.306 --> 00:25:20.726 A:middle
or non-spatial costs or for

00:25:20.726 --> 00:25:24.506 A:middle
when you need more clear
control over the pathfinding.

00:25:24.986 --> 00:25:26.386 A:middle
You can imagine a strategy game

00:25:26.386 --> 00:25:27.696 A:middle
that has a variety
of terrain types.

00:25:27.696 --> 00:25:29.106 A:middle
Perhaps you want a
forest terrain type

00:25:29.576 --> 00:25:31.716 A:middle
to take double the move over
as my other terrain types.

00:25:31.956 --> 00:25:34.286 A:middle
I correctly want pathfinding
to take this into account.

00:25:34.286 --> 00:25:36.866 A:middle
I don't want it to return
the visually shortest path.

00:25:36.866 --> 00:25:39.306 A:middle
I correctly want it to
navigate around the forest.

00:25:39.306 --> 00:25:41.136 A:middle
Because that is actually
the shortest path

00:25:41.416 --> 00:25:42.936 A:middle
in my game world's terms.

00:25:43.876 --> 00:25:45.836 A:middle
GKGraphNode is also
useful when you want

00:25:45.836 --> 00:25:48.306 A:middle
to manually make your own
graphs, and you do this

00:25:48.306 --> 00:25:50.486 A:middle
by manually managing the
connections between nodes.

00:25:50.846 --> 00:25:52.886 A:middle
This is really good for
things like abstract

00:25:52.886 --> 00:25:54.036 A:middle
or non-spatial graphs.

00:25:54.456 --> 00:25:56.706 A:middle
Perhaps you want your game to
have portals and your units

00:25:56.706 --> 00:25:58.366 A:middle
to correctly take those
portals into account

00:25:58.366 --> 00:25:59.586 A:middle
for pathfinding purposes,



00:26:00.166 --> 00:26:02.686 A:middle
even though those portals aren't
spatially connected in anyway.

00:26:03.656 --> 00:26:06.836 A:middle
And our Grid/GraphNode and
GraphNode2D which is used

00:26:06.836 --> 00:26:08.586 A:middle
with our obstacle node
are also available

00:26:08.586 --> 00:26:09.966 A:middle
for subclass as you see fit.

00:26:12.996 --> 00:26:14.906 A:middle
This is a feature I'm
really excited about.

00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:17.336 A:middle
We have done some work with
the SpriteKit team to allow you

00:26:17.336 --> 00:26:19.206 A:middle
to easily generate
these obstacle graphs

00:26:19.456 --> 00:26:21.276 A:middle
from your existing
SpriteKit Scenes.

00:26:21.776 --> 00:26:23.726 A:middle
And you can do this for
things like node bounds,

00:26:24.046 --> 00:26:26.166 A:middle
node physics bodies,
and nodes textures.

00:26:27.096 --> 00:26:28.726 A:middle
So what this means is
with very few lines

00:26:28.726 --> 00:26:30.536 A:middle
of code you can take an
existing SpriteKit scene

00:26:30.736 --> 00:26:32.046 A:middle
and generate an obstacle graph

00:26:32.526 --> 00:26:34.986 A:middle
and automatically
pathfind around it.

00:26:35.696 --> 00:26:37.916 A:middle
Now I would like to give
you a small demo of this.

00:26:38.726 --> 00:26:40.426 A:middle
Let's explore pathfinding
with SpriteKit.

00:26:52.296 --> 00:26:54.036 A:middle
Here I have the tower
defense game we have talked

00:26:54.036 --> 00:26:56.686 A:middle
about implemented as
a SpriteKit scene.

00:26:57.346 --> 00:26:59.856 A:middle
I'm generating entities on
the left and they want to move

00:26:59.856 --> 00:27:00.786 A:middle
to the bridge on the right.



00:26:59.856 --> 00:27:00.786 A:middle
to the bridge on the right.

00:27:01.246 --> 00:27:03.716 A:middle
But because this is a tower
defense game I'm undoubtedly

00:27:03.716 --> 00:27:05.686 A:middle
going to place some
towers right,

00:27:05.726 --> 00:27:07.766 A:middle
that violate their current path.

00:27:07.766 --> 00:27:08.896 A:middle
So let's go ahead and place one.

00:27:09.866 --> 00:27:12.206 A:middle
And you'll notice they
correctly pathfind around it.

00:27:12.206 --> 00:27:14.056 A:middle
That's because we're using
the SpriteKit integration,

00:27:14.056 --> 00:27:14.726 A:middle
that we just talked about,

00:27:14.726 --> 00:27:17.256 A:middle
to automatically generate
an obstacle from that node,

00:27:17.966 --> 00:27:19.776 A:middle
update the underlying
GKObstacleGraph,

00:27:20.046 --> 00:27:20.796 A:middle
and update our path.

00:27:20.926 --> 00:27:24.286 A:middle
So let me turn a debugger, let
me remove this tower real quick.

00:27:24.446 --> 00:27:26.176 A:middle
You see we just start with
our simple path, right,

00:27:26.176 --> 00:27:27.236 A:middle
between start and end node.

00:27:28.006 --> 00:27:29.586 A:middle
But as I insert an
obstacle in here,

00:27:30.186 --> 00:27:32.666 A:middle
we recalculate the
underlining GKObstacleGraph.

00:27:32.666 --> 00:27:33.926 A:middle
And this allows our entities

00:27:33.926 --> 00:27:35.736 A:middle
to find a new path
around that obstacle.

00:27:35.736 --> 00:27:38.096 A:middle
So let's go ahead
and add a few more.

00:27:38.726 --> 00:27:44.516 A:middle
And because of that SpriteKit
integration, every time we add

00:27:44.516 --> 00:27:45.656 A:middle
or remove an obstacle,

00:27:46.146 --> 00:27:48.916 A:middle
we can keep that underlying
GKObstacleGraph updated.

00:27:53.296 --> 00:27:55.846 A:middle
So that's pathfinding
with SpriteKit.

00:27:56.516 --> 00:28:04.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]



00:27:56.516 --> 00:28:04.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:05.046 --> 00:28:06.766 A:middle
Now I would like to call
my colleague Ross Dexter

00:28:06.766 --> 00:28:09.226 A:middle
up to tell you a little
about our MinMax AI.

00:28:09.696 --> 00:28:09.966 A:middle
Ross.

00:28:11.516 --> 00:28:15.806 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:16.306 --> 00:28:16.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; ROSS DEXTER: Thanks, Bruno.

00:28:19.976 --> 00:28:22.166 A:middle
So many of the features
that Bruno spoke

00:28:22.166 --> 00:28:26.136 A:middle
about earlier can be used to
create AI, but they're more

00:28:26.136 --> 00:28:28.496 A:middle
about giving life to
entities within your game.

00:28:29.376 --> 00:28:31.256 A:middle
Many games also need
equal AI opponents

00:28:31.256 --> 00:28:34.246 A:middle
that can play the entire game by
the same rules as human players.

00:28:34.246 --> 00:28:36.636 A:middle
And this is critical for
games like Chess, Checkers,

00:28:36.826 --> 00:28:38.336 A:middle
Tic-Tac-Toe, and so on.

00:28:38.866 --> 00:28:40.816 A:middle
So we wanted to provide
you a solution for this.

00:28:42.136 --> 00:28:45.226 A:middle
And so we've chosen to implement
a classic AI solution, MinMax,

00:28:45.226 --> 00:28:46.676 A:middle
as a key part of GameplayKit.

00:28:47.146 --> 00:28:50.116 A:middle
MinMax works by looking at all
the moves available to a player,

00:28:50.406 --> 00:28:51.896 A:middle
and then it builds
out a decision tree,

00:28:52.226 --> 00:28:54.976 A:middle
from each of those moves and all
the permutations that can arise

00:28:54.976 --> 00:28:56.806 A:middle
from each of those moves.

00:28:56.846 --> 00:28:59.286 A:middle
When you request a move
from it, it searches this,

00:28:59.286 --> 00:29:01.276 A:middle
the decision tree,
looking for a move



00:28:59.286 --> 00:29:01.276 A:middle
the decision tree,
looking for a move

00:29:01.276 --> 00:29:04.866 A:middle
that maximizes potential gain
while minimizing potential loss.

00:29:05.306 --> 00:29:08.796 A:middle
This Tic-Tac-Toe example
here, the AI selects the move

00:29:08.796 --> 00:29:10.116 A:middle
on the right for the X player

00:29:10.186 --> 00:29:12.226 A:middle
because in the best case
it results in a win,

00:29:12.496 --> 00:29:14.456 A:middle
or in the worst case, it
only results in a draw,

00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:19.976 A:middle
the other two moves
both lead to losses.

00:29:19.976 --> 00:29:21.726 A:middle
So MinMax AI gives
you the ability

00:29:22.036 --> 00:29:23.506 A:middle
to add AI controlled
opponents to your games,

00:29:23.616 --> 00:29:26.896 A:middle
but it can also be used to
suggest a move for human players

00:29:26.896 --> 00:29:28.886 A:middle
when they get stuck, and it's
going to be great for games

00:29:28.886 --> 00:29:31.066 A:middle
that even don't have any
other AI requirements.

00:29:31.576 --> 00:29:34.666 A:middle
It's best suited for turn
based games, but it can be made

00:29:34.666 --> 00:29:36.976 A:middle
to work with any game
where you have a set

00:29:36.976 --> 00:29:38.846 A:middle
of discrete moves available
for players to make.

00:29:39.086 --> 00:29:43.756 A:middle
You can easily adjust
the difficulty of the AI

00:29:44.026 --> 00:29:46.796 A:middle
by varying how far out
into the future it looks.

00:29:47.406 --> 00:29:48.966 A:middle
Looking 10 moves
in advance results

00:29:48.966 --> 00:29:52.346 A:middle
in much more effective play than
looking ahead only 2 or 3 moves.

00:29:52.936 --> 00:29:55.336 A:middle
Additionally you can
optionally direct it

00:29:55.336 --> 00:29:57.546 A:middle
to randomly select
suboptimum moves

00:29:57.596 --> 00:29:59.266 A:middle
to give it an element
of human error.



00:30:00.556 --> 00:30:02.356 A:middle
So let's look at how this
integrates with your game.

00:30:03.066 --> 00:30:05.886 A:middle
The great thing about MinMax is
that it doesn't need to know any

00:30:05.886 --> 00:30:06.806 A:middle
of the details of your game.

00:30:06.906 --> 00:30:08.986 A:middle
You don't need to teach it
your rules and it doesn't need

00:30:08.986 --> 00:30:10.496 A:middle
to know how it's implemented.

00:30:10.776 --> 00:30:12.326 A:middle
This is all abstracted away.

00:30:12.436 --> 00:30:15.346 A:middle
All you have to do is provide
a list of players in the game,

00:30:15.886 --> 00:30:17.116 A:middle
the possible moves
they can make,

00:30:17.716 --> 00:30:20.656 A:middle
and a score for each player that
indicates the relative strength

00:30:20.936 --> 00:30:21.916 A:middle
of their current position.

00:30:22.996 --> 00:30:25.906 A:middle
When you request a move from
the AI, it takes all this data

00:30:25.906 --> 00:30:27.676 A:middle
into account and it
builds a decision tree,

00:30:27.796 --> 00:30:30.036 A:middle
and returns the optimal
move for you to use.

00:30:30.036 --> 00:30:34.566 A:middle
Let's look at the classes.

00:30:34.816 --> 00:30:36.256 A:middle
There are three key protocols
that you're going to need

00:30:36.256 --> 00:30:38.336 A:middle
to implement to work
with the MinMax AI.

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:40.516 A:middle
And the first of
these is GKGameModel,

00:30:40.856 --> 00:30:42.876 A:middle
and it's an abstract of
the current game state.

00:30:44.336 --> 00:30:48.396 A:middle
If you're creating a Chess game
for example, a good candidate

00:30:48.396 --> 00:30:50.936 A:middle
to implement this class would
be on, say, the board class

00:30:50.936 --> 00:30:54.426 A:middle
because it tracks all of the
positions on the board as well

00:30:54.426 --> 00:30:55.806 A:middle
as all the pieces that
are currently in play.

00:30:56.416 --> 00:30:58.646 A:middle
As I mentioned on the
previous slide, all this needs

00:30:58.646 --> 00:31:01.486 A:middle
to do is provide a list of
the players that are active



00:30:58.646 --> 00:31:01.486 A:middle
to do is provide a list of
the players that are active

00:31:01.486 --> 00:31:04.526 A:middle
in the game, the current
player, scores for each

00:31:04.526 --> 00:31:07.146 A:middle
of those players, and then
the possible moves that each

00:31:07.146 --> 00:31:08.456 A:middle
of those players can make.

00:31:08.456 --> 00:31:11.546 A:middle
It also needs to have a method
for applying those moves

00:31:11.956 --> 00:31:14.456 A:middle
and this is used by the AI to
build out its decision tree,

00:31:14.456 --> 00:31:16.456 A:middle
and can be used by
you to apply a move

00:31:16.456 --> 00:31:17.646 A:middle
after it's been selected
by the AI.

00:31:18.076 --> 00:31:19.536 A:middle
And when this move is applied,

00:31:19.566 --> 00:31:21.206 A:middle
it will change the
current game state,

00:31:21.456 --> 00:31:23.786 A:middle
possibly changing the
current act of the player,

00:31:23.996 --> 00:31:25.786 A:middle
scores for each of those
players, and the moves

00:31:25.906 --> 00:31:26.876 A:middle
that are available to them.

00:31:28.296 --> 00:31:30.486 A:middle
The next protocol is
GKGameModelUpdate,

00:31:30.656 --> 00:31:32.516 A:middle
this is an abstract of
a move within your game.

00:31:32.996 --> 00:31:35.196 A:middle
It should have all
of the data you need

00:31:35.276 --> 00:31:37.376 A:middle
to apply a move to
your game model.

00:31:37.996 --> 00:31:40.436 A:middle
As we have said, it is
used by MinMax to build

00:31:40.436 --> 00:31:43.256 A:middle
out the decision tree, and can
be used by you to apply a move

00:31:43.256 --> 00:31:44.146 A:middle
after it's been selected.

00:31:45.186 --> 00:31:47.216 A:middle
Finally we have
GKGameModelPlayer

00:31:47.616 --> 00:31:50.356 A:middle
which is an abstract of a player
of the game, and it's used

00:31:50.356 --> 00:31:53.186 A:middle
by the AI to differentiate
moves from one another.

00:31:53.186 --> 00:31:57.376 A:middle
Now we get to the AI itself,

00:31:57.376 --> 00:31:59.716 A:middle
it's within the class
GKMinMaxStrategist,



00:32:00.116 --> 00:32:01.946 A:middle
and it operates on
a GKGameModel.

00:32:02.146 --> 00:32:04.566 A:middle
So after you create an
instance the MinMaxStrategist,

00:32:04.616 --> 00:32:06.336 A:middle
you're going to hook it up
on the gameModel property.

00:32:07.696 --> 00:32:10.466 A:middle
maxLookAheadDepth is how
far into the future it looks

00:32:10.466 --> 00:32:11.936 A:middle
when you request a
move from the AI.

00:32:12.106 --> 00:32:15.656 A:middle
And as we mentioned earlier
higher numbers result

00:32:15.916 --> 00:32:17.856 A:middle
in more effective play
than lower numbers.

00:32:18.326 --> 00:32:19.716 A:middle
And that's all you need
to do to start using it.

00:32:20.126 --> 00:32:22.926 A:middle
When you call bestMoveForPlayer,
the AI will build

00:32:22.926 --> 00:32:25.956 A:middle
out its decision tree, rank all
the available moves in order

00:32:25.956 --> 00:32:28.546 A:middle
from best to worse, and then
return the optimal move.

00:32:29.146 --> 00:32:31.196 A:middle
There may arise cases where
you'll have more than one move

00:32:31.196 --> 00:32:33.036 A:middle
that is equally advantageous
for the AI to make,

00:32:33.576 --> 00:32:36.426 A:middle
and in those cases
you can direct the AI

00:32:36.546 --> 00:32:37.626 A:middle
to randomly break ties.

00:32:38.486 --> 00:32:40.316 A:middle
And that sort of thing
comes in use if you want

00:32:40.316 --> 00:32:41.646 A:middle
to call randomMoveForPlayer.

00:32:42.086 --> 00:32:45.696 A:middle
Say you have 10 moves available
for a player, but you only want

00:32:45.696 --> 00:32:49.086 A:middle
to select a random one from
the 3 best moves, it will take

00:32:49.086 --> 00:32:52.576 A:middle
that sorting and randomly choose
one of those 3 best moves.

00:32:53.156 --> 00:32:54.886 A:middle
One of those moves may be
suboptimal unfortunately,

00:32:54.886 --> 00:32:56.466 A:middle
but that may be desirable
if you are trying

00:32:56.466 --> 00:32:58.206 A:middle
to make your AI appear
more human

00:32:58.206 --> 00:32:59.586 A:middle
and have a chance
of making an error.



00:33:00.166 --> 00:33:02.256 A:middle
And both bestMoveForPlayer

00:33:02.256 --> 00:33:05.396 A:middle
and randomMoveForPlayer
return a GKGameModelUpdate

00:33:05.396 --> 00:33:06.686 A:middle
which you can then use to apply

00:33:07.106 --> 00:33:10.086 A:middle
to your GKGameModel
to make a move.

00:33:11.256 --> 00:33:13.186 A:middle
So here is a quick code sample.

00:33:13.596 --> 00:33:15.796 A:middle
Here we're creating
a Chess game model.

00:33:16.126 --> 00:33:19.196 A:middle
And unfortunately going over the
details of how you might want

00:33:19.196 --> 00:33:21.166 A:middle
to implement your game
model are beyond the scope

00:33:21.166 --> 00:33:23.686 A:middle
of this session, but we do have
excellent sample code available

00:33:23.976 --> 00:33:25.686 A:middle
that you can look at to
show how you might want

00:33:25.686 --> 00:33:26.566 A:middle
to go about doing this.

00:33:26.886 --> 00:33:28.446 A:middle
So we create our Chess model,

00:33:28.846 --> 00:33:31.636 A:middle
and then we create
our MinMax AI,

00:33:31.636 --> 00:33:34.496 A:middle
and hook it up by
setting the game model

00:33:34.496 --> 00:33:35.396 A:middle
on the gameModel property.

00:33:36.216 --> 00:33:38.226 A:middle
We then choose our
LookAheadDepth to 6,

00:33:38.746 --> 00:33:40.426 A:middle
so we're going to look
ahead 6 turns in advance

00:33:40.426 --> 00:33:41.476 A:middle
when we build our decision tree.

00:33:42.216 --> 00:33:43.116 A:middle
That's all we need to do.

00:33:43.656 --> 00:33:46.416 A:middle
Now we call bestMoveForPlayer
with a currently active player

00:33:46.656 --> 00:33:49.086 A:middle
and it will find the
optimal move for that player

00:33:49.166 --> 00:33:50.116 A:middle
with the given information.

00:33:50.786 --> 00:33:53.296 A:middle
You can then apply that move to
the game model to make the move.

00:33:53.296 --> 00:33:56.866 A:middle
So let's look at a quick demo.



00:34:13.076 --> 00:34:15.005 A:middle
So here we have a simple game
where there are two players,

00:34:15.326 --> 00:34:17.565 A:middle
black and white, and they're
trying to get as many pieces

00:34:17.815 --> 00:34:19.856 A:middle
of their color on the
board as they can.

00:34:20.505 --> 00:34:25.136 A:middle
When they place a piece on the
board they will flip any colors

00:34:25.136 --> 00:34:27.576 A:middle
of the opponent's pieces
to their color that lie

00:34:27.576 --> 00:34:28.835 A:middle
between their own pieces.

00:34:29.386 --> 00:34:33.416 A:middle
So here we have both
players controlled by the AI,

00:34:33.696 --> 00:34:36.025 A:middle
the black player is looking
ahead five moves in advance,

00:34:36.025 --> 00:34:38.565 A:middle
while the white player is only
looking ahead three moves.

00:34:38.946 --> 00:34:42.606 A:middle
This allows the black player to
easily defeat the white player

00:34:42.696 --> 00:34:43.596 A:middle
as it goes through the game.

00:34:43.726 --> 00:34:47.856 A:middle
You can see here we have
a score for each player.

00:34:47.966 --> 00:34:51.866 A:middle
This is simply we take a look at
how many pieces the player has

00:34:51.866 --> 00:34:55.456 A:middle
on the board minus the number of
pieces that their opponent has

00:34:55.456 --> 00:34:57.436 A:middle
on the board, adjusted
with some weights,

00:34:57.436 --> 00:34:58.556 A:middle
and that gives us our score.

00:34:58.556 --> 00:35:01.286 A:middle
So you see here the black player
easily defeats the white player.



00:34:58.556 --> 00:35:01.286 A:middle
So you see here the black player
easily defeats the white player.

00:35:01.676 --> 00:35:06.076 A:middle
So let's look closer
at the score here.

00:35:06.996 --> 00:35:10.546 A:middle
We see here that we have all
of the pieces in the center,

00:35:10.546 --> 00:35:11.886 A:middle
they're weighted at 1.

00:35:12.116 --> 00:35:14.426 A:middle
The position on the edge of
the board are weighted higher,

00:35:14.426 --> 00:35:16.226 A:middle
the corners are weighted
even higher.

00:35:16.476 --> 00:35:18.106 A:middle
That's because these
positions are more advantageous

00:35:18.106 --> 00:35:20.456 A:middle
for the players, and
so we direct the AI

00:35:20.566 --> 00:35:21.546 A:middle
to favor these places

00:35:21.546 --> 00:35:24.666 A:middle
by changing how those
places effect the scores.

00:35:26.216 --> 00:35:29.256 A:middle
So let's change-up the
look ahead on these guys.

00:35:29.256 --> 00:35:31.636 A:middle
We'll make white look
ahead 4 instead of just 3.

00:35:32.346 --> 00:35:35.246 A:middle
And even just this small
change will allow the AI

00:35:35.656 --> 00:35:37.616 A:middle
to play more effectively
and in fact in the middle

00:35:37.616 --> 00:35:40.516 A:middle
of the game it looks like the
white AI has the upper hand,

00:35:40.516 --> 00:35:43.536 A:middle
but the black AI is able
to trade a short-term game

00:35:43.686 --> 00:35:44.736 A:middle
for a long-term victory,

00:35:45.106 --> 00:35:47.946 A:middle
and is able to overcome
white in the end.

00:35:54.096 --> 00:35:54.736 A:middle
That's MinMax AI.

00:35:56.516 --> 00:36:02.696 A:middle
[ Applause ]



00:35:56.516 --> 00:36:02.696 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:36:03.196 --> 00:36:05.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; ROSS DEXTER: So now let's
talk about random sources.

00:36:06.136 --> 00:36:07.986 A:middle
And at first this topic
may seem unnecessary,

00:36:07.986 --> 00:36:09.656 A:middle
because we already have rand.

00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.636 A:middle
Why shouldn't we just use that?

00:36:11.556 --> 00:36:13.046 A:middle
Well rand gives us
random numbers

00:36:13.046 --> 00:36:15.266 A:middle
but games have unique
random number needs,

00:36:15.266 --> 00:36:18.186 A:middle
and rand may not give
us everything we want.

00:36:19.046 --> 00:36:20.066 A:middle
First of all the numbers

00:36:20.066 --> 00:36:23.536 A:middle
that rand generates may not be
the same from system to system.

00:36:23.536 --> 00:36:25.246 A:middle
You're not guaranteed
to have the same results

00:36:25.346 --> 00:36:26.326 A:middle
on different platforms.

00:36:26.766 --> 00:36:29.036 A:middle
And that can be a big
problem for networking games,

00:36:29.036 --> 00:36:31.296 A:middle
because if we can't rely on
the numbers on either side

00:36:31.296 --> 00:36:32.636 A:middle
of the collection
to be generated

00:36:32.636 --> 00:36:35.026 A:middle
in the same sequence we have
to waste critical bandwidth

00:36:35.286 --> 00:36:36.456 A:middle
in syncing those two sides up.

00:36:37.216 --> 00:36:39.156 A:middle
So we want platform-independent
determinism.

00:36:40.016 --> 00:36:41.486 A:middle
Also whenever we make a call

00:36:41.486 --> 00:36:43.186 A:middle
to rand we're drawing
from a single source.

00:36:43.706 --> 00:36:46.476 A:middle
So if I have a bunch of
calls to rand in my AI code,

00:36:46.526 --> 00:36:48.826 A:middle
and then I add a new
call in my physics code,

00:36:49.206 --> 00:36:51.096 A:middle
that call in the physics
code will affect the numbers

00:36:51.096 --> 00:36:54.276 A:middle
that are being generated in
my AI code, which could result

00:36:54.456 --> 00:36:55.606 A:middle
in unexpected behavior.

00:36:55.886 --> 00:36:56.906 A:middle
What we really want
to do is be able

00:36:56.906 --> 00:36:58.476 A:middle
to separate those
two systems apart,

00:36:58.806 --> 00:37:01.346 A:middle
so that the numbers generated
in one system have no effect



00:36:58.806 --> 00:37:01.346 A:middle
so that the numbers generated
in one system have no effect

00:37:01.526 --> 00:37:03.646 A:middle
on the numbers generated
in a different system.

00:37:04.316 --> 00:37:07.366 A:middle
And also we may not want
control over just the range

00:37:07.366 --> 00:37:08.286 A:middle
of numbers we're generating

00:37:08.526 --> 00:37:11.146 A:middle
but also how those numbers are
distributed across that range.

00:37:11.146 --> 00:37:13.436 A:middle
And this is where
random sources comes in.

00:37:14.076 --> 00:37:16.536 A:middle
So we're offering you a set
of game quality random sources

00:37:16.536 --> 00:37:18.896 A:middle
that are deterministic, so
when you have the same seed,

00:37:18.896 --> 00:37:20.406 A:middle
you will always get
the same sequence

00:37:20.406 --> 00:37:21.996 A:middle
of numbers no matter
what platform you're on.

00:37:22.416 --> 00:37:24.336 A:middle
They are also serializable
so they can be saved

00:37:24.336 --> 00:37:25.046 A:middle
out with your game data.

00:37:25.046 --> 00:37:27.306 A:middle
And this can be really useful
in helping to prevent cheating.

00:37:27.586 --> 00:37:30.076 A:middle
And they're also implemented
using industry-standard

00:37:30.076 --> 00:37:31.686 A:middle
algorithms that are
known to be reliable,

00:37:32.296 --> 00:37:34.236 A:middle
and have excellent
random characteristics.

00:37:34.906 --> 00:37:37.356 A:middle
In addition we offer you a
set of random distributions

00:37:37.356 --> 00:37:39.106 A:middle
to leverage, and these allow you

00:37:39.106 --> 00:37:42.016 A:middle
to control how your
numbers are distributed

00:37:42.016 --> 00:37:43.506 A:middle
across the given range.

00:37:43.506 --> 00:37:46.596 A:middle
We have a true random where
every value is equally likely

00:37:46.596 --> 00:37:49.886 A:middle
to occur, Gaussian distribution
where values are weighted

00:37:49.886 --> 00:37:52.426 A:middle
on a bell curve with values
toward the mean more likely

00:37:52.426 --> 00:37:55.106 A:middle
than those on the fringes,
and also anti-clustering

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:56.566 A:middle
or fair random distribution

00:37:56.806 --> 00:37:58.506 A:middle
which helps eliminate
runs of numbers.

00:37:59.146 --> 00:38:02.246 A:middle
And finally we have NSArray
shuffling, which is super useful



00:37:59.146 --> 00:38:02.246 A:middle
And finally we have NSArray
shuffling, which is super useful

00:38:02.246 --> 00:38:04.196 A:middle
for doing things like
shuffling a deck of cards.

00:38:04.196 --> 00:38:06.166 A:middle
So let's look at the classes.

00:38:06.566 --> 00:38:09.556 A:middle
GKRandomSource is the base
class for random sources.

00:38:09.816 --> 00:38:11.776 A:middle
And it adopts NSSecureCoding
and NSCopying

00:38:11.776 --> 00:38:13.226 A:middle
so it can be securely
serialized.

00:38:14.816 --> 00:38:17.636 A:middle
Determinism is guaranteed
with the same seed,

00:38:17.786 --> 00:38:18.996 A:middle
no matter what platform
you're on,

00:38:18.996 --> 00:38:21.476 A:middle
so if you want the same sequence
of numbers, you can always rely

00:38:21.476 --> 00:38:22.306 A:middle
on it to be generated.

00:38:23.066 --> 00:38:26.046 A:middle
If no seed is given,
one is drawn

00:38:26.046 --> 00:38:27.276 A:middle
from a secure system source.

00:38:28.066 --> 00:38:31.786 A:middle
Go on to sharedRandom, which is
the system's underlying shared

00:38:31.786 --> 00:38:33.976 A:middle
random source, and this
is not deterministic

00:38:33.976 --> 00:38:36.176 A:middle
but there are cases in
which this may be desirable,

00:38:36.526 --> 00:38:38.656 A:middle
such as when you're
shuffling a deck of cards

00:38:38.696 --> 00:38:40.466 A:middle
and you want every
result to be unique.

00:38:40.946 --> 00:38:44.546 A:middle
Let's go over the AI random
source algorithms we have

00:38:44.656 --> 00:38:45.376 A:middle
available for you.

00:38:45.716 --> 00:38:48.156 A:middle
We have ARC4, which
has very low overhead

00:38:48.156 --> 00:38:49.856 A:middle
and excellent random
characteristics and is going

00:38:49.856 --> 00:38:51.386 A:middle
to be your Goldilocks
random source,

00:38:51.386 --> 00:38:54.036 A:middle
we have Linear Congruential
which has even lower overhead

00:38:54.036 --> 00:38:57.396 A:middle
than ARC4, but it's random
characteristics are not quite

00:38:57.396 --> 00:38:59.346 A:middle
as good, and you may see
some more frequently repeated

00:38:59.346 --> 00:39:02.006 A:middle
sequences of numbers, finally
we have the Mersenne Twister,



00:38:59.346 --> 00:39:02.006 A:middle
sequences of numbers, finally
we have the Mersenne Twister,

00:39:02.296 --> 00:39:04.056 A:middle
which is high quality
but memory intensive.

00:39:04.636 --> 00:39:06.626 A:middle
Note that none of these are
suitable for cryptography

00:39:06.626 --> 00:39:09.316 A:middle
but Apple offers other separate
APIs to meet these needs.

00:39:10.006 --> 00:39:13.966 A:middle
Now we get to our random
distributions, in the base class

00:39:13.966 --> 00:39:15.726 A:middle
for this, it is
GKRandomDistribution

00:39:15.726 --> 00:39:17.896 A:middle
which is implements a
pure random distribution,

00:39:18.226 --> 00:39:21.666 A:middle
meaning every value between
lowest value and highest value,

00:39:21.966 --> 00:39:23.166 A:middle
are equally likely to occur.

00:39:23.906 --> 00:39:25.676 A:middle
You can get numbers
by calling nextInt,

00:39:26.236 --> 00:39:27.306 A:middle
nextUniform, and nextBool.

00:39:27.306 --> 00:39:31.406 A:middle
We also offer a set of dice
convenience constructors

00:39:31.406 --> 00:39:35.696 A:middle
to create 6 sided, 20
sided, and custom sided die.

00:39:37.296 --> 00:39:39.656 A:middle
Then we have
GKGaussianDistribution

00:39:39.656 --> 00:39:42.936 A:middle
which implements a bell
curve Gaussian distribution.

00:39:43.926 --> 00:39:46.146 A:middle
The values are biased
towards the mean value

00:39:46.546 --> 00:39:49.306 A:middle
and the values farther away
from the mean are less likely

00:39:49.306 --> 00:39:50.216 A:middle
to occur, and that's
what happened

00:39:50.216 --> 00:39:51.526 A:middle
in our sample distribution here.

00:39:52.216 --> 00:39:55.656 A:middle
We have generated a sequence
of 15 numbers between 1 and 5,

00:39:55.656 --> 00:39:58.396 A:middle
and we see that the mean value
of 3 occurs far more frequently

00:39:58.796 --> 00:39:59.946 A:middle
than any of the other numbers.



00:40:00.476 --> 00:40:03.016 A:middle
In fact it occurs
more than twice

00:40:03.016 --> 00:40:04.386 A:middle
as frequently as
any other number.

00:40:04.386 --> 00:40:06.026 A:middle
With 1 and 5, the
values on the fringes,

00:40:06.306 --> 00:40:07.646 A:middle
only occurring a
single time each.

00:40:08.176 --> 00:40:11.386 A:middle
Note that in a standard Gaussian
distribution, is unbounded

00:40:11.756 --> 00:40:13.526 A:middle
but that's undesirable
for a random source,

00:40:13.846 --> 00:40:16.026 A:middle
so we call every value outside

00:40:16.276 --> 00:40:18.076 A:middle
of a three standard
deviations of the mean.

00:40:18.566 --> 00:40:24.006 A:middle
Next we have our anti-clustering
distribution implemented

00:40:24.006 --> 00:40:25.816 A:middle
in the class
GKShuffledDistribution.

00:40:26.056 --> 00:40:29.756 A:middle
This is our fair random
distribution, which helps reduce

00:40:29.756 --> 00:40:32.636 A:middle
or eliminate runs of numbers,
but it's random over time.

00:40:33.276 --> 00:40:35.526 A:middle
And you control this by
using the uniformDistance.

00:40:36.096 --> 00:40:40.016 A:middle
At 0.0, all numbers are
equally likely to occur,

00:40:40.266 --> 00:40:43.026 A:middle
and this is indistinguishable
from a true random source,

00:40:43.936 --> 00:40:44.776 A:middle
our random distribution.

00:40:45.656 --> 00:40:47.796 A:middle
At 1.0, all values are
different and it will run

00:40:47.796 --> 00:40:49.506 A:middle
through every value in
the range before you start

00:40:49.506 --> 00:40:50.876 A:middle
to see any repeated values.

00:40:51.936 --> 00:40:52.806 A:middle
That's what we have here.

00:40:52.806 --> 00:40:54.026 A:middle
In our distribution here.

00:40:54.026 --> 00:40:56.706 A:middle
Once again we're generating
15 numbers between 1 and 5

00:40:57.126 --> 00:40:59.466 A:middle
and you can see that
we're hitting every number

00:40:59.466 --> 00:41:02.296 A:middle
in the range before we start
to see any repeated values.



00:40:59.466 --> 00:41:02.296 A:middle
in the range before we start
to see any repeated values.

00:41:02.666 --> 00:41:06.496 A:middle
And in fact every value is
generated exactly three times.

00:41:06.496 --> 00:41:10.486 A:middle
So let's go over the
simple code examples.

00:41:11.786 --> 00:41:14.846 A:middle
It's very easy to create a
6 sided die random source,

00:41:14.846 --> 00:41:16.336 A:middle
you just use the
connivence constructor

00:41:16.646 --> 00:41:20.346 A:middle
GKRandomDistribution,
and rolling the dye is

00:41:20.346 --> 00:41:22.446 A:middle
as easy as calling nextInt.

00:41:23.116 --> 00:41:30.116 A:middle
It's similarly easy to
create a 20 sided die.

00:41:30.296 --> 00:41:33.386 A:middle
And creating custom
die is also quite easy.

00:41:33.486 --> 00:41:35.146 A:middle
Here we're creating
a 256 sided die

00:41:35.146 --> 00:41:36.256 A:middle
which would be pretty
awkward if you tried

00:41:36.256 --> 00:41:37.136 A:middle
to roll it in the real world.

00:41:37.716 --> 00:41:43.026 A:middle
The previous three examples were
all implemented using a true

00:41:43.026 --> 00:41:45.586 A:middle
random distribution, but you
can use any of the distributions

00:41:45.586 --> 00:41:46.586 A:middle
that we have available to you.

00:41:46.966 --> 00:41:48.626 A:middle
Here we're creating
a 20 sided die

00:41:48.626 --> 00:41:51.556 A:middle
with a Gaussian distribution, so
it's weighted to the mean value,

00:41:51.556 --> 00:41:54.246 A:middle
around 11, so when you roll
it, you're most likely to come

00:41:54.246 --> 00:41:55.116 A:middle
up with a number around there.

00:41:55.656 --> 00:41:59.416 A:middle
And here we're creating
a die, a 20 sided die

00:41:59.876 --> 00:42:01.576 A:middle
with our shuffle distribution,



00:41:59.876 --> 00:42:01.576 A:middle
with our shuffle distribution,

00:42:02.706 --> 00:42:04.786 A:middle
and by default the
uniform distance

00:42:04.786 --> 00:42:08.046 A:middle
on our shuffle distribution
is 1.0.

00:42:08.236 --> 00:42:10.946 A:middle
So when we roll this one,
we're going to hit every value

00:42:10.946 --> 00:42:13.196 A:middle
in the range before we start
to see any repeated values.

00:42:13.416 --> 00:42:15.136 A:middle
The first time we roll
it, we might get 5,

00:42:15.566 --> 00:42:17.616 A:middle
then we know the next time we
roll it, we definitely not going

00:42:17.616 --> 00:42:19.606 A:middle
to get that number
again, until we run

00:42:19.606 --> 00:42:21.576 A:middle
through every other
value in the range.

00:42:23.706 --> 00:42:26.416 A:middle
And finally, here we
have array shuffling,

00:42:27.036 --> 00:42:29.496 A:middle
we're using the shared random
source we mentioned earlier

00:42:29.496 --> 00:42:31.396 A:middle
on GKRandomSource,
which gives us access

00:42:31.426 --> 00:42:33.496 A:middle
to the system's underlying
random source,

00:42:33.496 --> 00:42:34.786 A:middle
which is not deterministic,

00:42:35.226 --> 00:42:37.866 A:middle
but in this case
that's advantageous.

00:42:38.206 --> 00:42:41.466 A:middle
We want every instance of the
card shoveling to be unique.

00:42:42.286 --> 00:42:43.896 A:middle
And you can see how easy it is

00:42:44.216 --> 00:42:45.896 A:middle
to make random sources
a part of your game.

00:42:46.336 --> 00:42:48.306 A:middle
It's only a couple lines of
code and you can get going.

00:42:48.306 --> 00:42:50.396 A:middle
And that's random sources.

00:42:51.696 --> 00:42:53.946 A:middle
So now I would like to invite
Joshua Boggs up here to talk

00:42:53.946 --> 00:42:54.916 A:middle
about our rule systems.

00:42:55.516 --> 00:43:02.076 A:middle
[ Applause ]



00:42:55.516 --> 00:43:02.076 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:43:02.576 --> 00:43:02.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JOSHUA BOGGS: Thanks, Ross.

00:43:07.046 --> 00:43:08.106 A:middle
Hi. I'm Josh.

00:43:08.326 --> 00:43:10.266 A:middle
I have been working
alongside Bruno

00:43:10.266 --> 00:43:11.656 A:middle
and Ross while they've
been putting

00:43:11.656 --> 00:43:13.956 A:middle
on the finishing
touches to GameplayKit.

00:43:14.166 --> 00:43:18.386 A:middle
I'm here to talk about one of
those systems, the rule systems.

00:43:18.866 --> 00:43:21.996 A:middle
So before I go into the rule
systems, I just want to go

00:43:21.996 --> 00:43:24.196 A:middle
over some common ingredients
that games tend to have.

00:43:24.946 --> 00:43:28.156 A:middle
Games tend to consistent of
three elements, it is things

00:43:28.156 --> 00:43:32.726 A:middle
like your nouns: position,
speed, player health,

00:43:33.406 --> 00:43:34.456 A:middle
equipment they may be holding.

00:43:36.056 --> 00:43:39.616 A:middle
Secondly, you've got things
like verbs: these are actions

00:43:39.616 --> 00:43:42.936 A:middle
that the player can perform,
things like run, jump,

00:43:43.746 --> 00:43:47.116 A:middle
using an item, or if you're
in a car, accelerating.

00:43:47.596 --> 00:43:49.476 A:middle
Lastly, the rules.

00:43:49.966 --> 00:43:52.826 A:middle
Rules are incredibly important

00:43:52.826 --> 00:43:55.746 A:middle
because they define how your
nouns and verbs interact.

00:43:57.166 --> 00:43:59.256 A:middle
Rules give flavor and
texture to your gam,

00:43:59.256 --> 00:44:00.656 A:middle
and great games have
great rules.



00:43:59.256 --> 00:44:00.656 A:middle
and great games have
great rules.

00:44:00.656 --> 00:44:03.526 A:middle
So let's have a look
at an example rule.

00:44:03.526 --> 00:44:10.346 A:middle
Here we have a rule that
a driver may use to decide

00:44:10.346 --> 00:44:11.676 A:middle
when to brake and
when to accelerate.

00:44:13.366 --> 00:44:14.376 A:middle
Using an input property

00:44:14.376 --> 00:44:17.556 A:middle
of distance the player will
either slow down or speed up.

00:44:17.556 --> 00:44:22.136 A:middle
We can see in this example that
if the distance is less than 5,

00:44:22.136 --> 00:44:23.726 A:middle
they're going to brake,
when it's greater than

00:44:23.726 --> 00:44:24.676 A:middle
or equal they'll accelerate.

00:44:26.656 --> 00:44:29.326 A:middle
This is fine logic, but
there is a subtle problem.

00:44:29.756 --> 00:44:33.926 A:middle
In the distances around 5, we're
going to get very jerky movement

00:44:34.176 --> 00:44:36.956 A:middle
because the car is going
to continue to oscillate

00:44:37.496 --> 00:44:38.766 A:middle
between braking and
accelerating.

00:44:39.356 --> 00:44:42.976 A:middle
This is going to give
us very jerky movement.

00:44:43.306 --> 00:44:46.336 A:middle
So for more natural movement
we need something a little

00:44:46.406 --> 00:44:47.246 A:middle
more approximate.

00:44:49.496 --> 00:44:55.426 A:middle
Using a more fuzzy solution
we output facts about what

00:44:55.426 --> 00:44:58.216 A:middle
to do rather than perform
the actions immediately,

00:44:58.766 --> 00:45:01.266 A:middle
we've output two facts
here, closeness and farness,



00:44:58.766 --> 00:45:01.266 A:middle
we've output two facts
here, closeness and farness,

00:45:01.676 --> 00:45:02.666 A:middle
both based on distance.

00:45:03.586 --> 00:45:09.676 A:middle
The important thing is you
can now be both close and far.

00:45:09.676 --> 00:45:11.746 A:middle
So rather than perform
one or the other,

00:45:12.196 --> 00:45:13.756 A:middle
this lets us blend
the two together

00:45:13.756 --> 00:45:14.976 A:middle
to get a more natural movement.

00:45:15.706 --> 00:45:18.996 A:middle
This is especially important
around the previous example.

00:45:18.996 --> 00:45:19.806 A:middle
Now when the distance is

00:45:19.806 --> 00:45:23.926 A:middle
around 5 we'll get much
more natural acceleration.

00:45:23.926 --> 00:45:30.056 A:middle
This is the motivation
behind rule systems.

00:45:30.916 --> 00:45:32.416 A:middle
Facts can be grades of true.

00:45:32.416 --> 00:45:34.786 A:middle
This allows us to perform
more complex reasoning

00:45:34.786 --> 00:45:35.466 A:middle
with fuzzy logic.

00:45:37.426 --> 00:45:39.206 A:middle
Fuzzy logic deals
with approximations.

00:45:39.936 --> 00:45:43.456 A:middle
It also allows us to
separate what we do

00:45:43.656 --> 00:45:44.456 A:middle
from how we should do it,

00:45:44.456 --> 00:45:48.136 A:middle
rather than performing actions
immediately, we just state facts

00:45:48.136 --> 00:45:50.996 A:middle
about the world, and then take
deferred actions later based off

00:45:50.996 --> 00:45:51.576 A:middle
of those facts.

00:45:52.846 --> 00:45:54.236 A:middle
So let's take a look at
one of those classes.

00:45:56.576 --> 00:45:57.536 A:middle
Here we have GKRule.

00:45:59.116 --> 00:46:02.136 A:middle
GKRule consists of a Boolean
predicate and an action.



00:45:59.116 --> 00:46:02.136 A:middle
GKRule consists of a Boolean
predicate and an action.

00:46:03.626 --> 00:46:06.566 A:middle
The predicate matches
against facts and the state

00:46:06.566 --> 00:46:09.766 A:middle
in the system and only fires its
action if the predicate is true.

00:46:10.876 --> 00:46:12.956 A:middle
Actions could be as
simple as asserting a fact,

00:46:12.956 --> 00:46:15.446 A:middle
or as complicated as you'd
like with a complex block.

00:46:17.226 --> 00:46:22.126 A:middle
Importantly they can now be
serializable using NSPredicate

00:46:22.206 --> 00:46:24.536 A:middle
serialization methods.

00:46:27.536 --> 00:46:29.226 A:middle
The important thing
to remember is

00:46:29.226 --> 00:46:32.546 A:middle
that rule systems provide
approximations to answers.

00:46:32.686 --> 00:46:34.776 A:middle
Things like how close am
I to the car in front?

00:46:34.776 --> 00:46:37.106 A:middle
In the first example
we can kind of say

00:46:37.106 --> 00:46:38.816 A:middle
that with a fairly high grade

00:46:38.816 --> 00:46:40.836 A:middle
of confidence, that
we're quite far.

00:46:41.216 --> 00:46:44.316 A:middle
Where with the other two,
things are a little more fuzzy,

00:46:44.316 --> 00:46:45.136 A:middle
answers that we're after,

00:46:45.136 --> 00:46:47.546 A:middle
things like somewhere
in between, closer.

00:46:48.106 --> 00:46:52.696 A:middle
Let's have a look at the system
that manages these rules.

00:46:52.696 --> 00:46:57.106 A:middle
Here we have the other
class, GKRuleSystem.

00:46:57.306 --> 00:47:02.986 A:middle
GKRuleSystem is an ordered
collection of rules and facts.



00:46:57.306 --> 00:47:02.986 A:middle
GKRuleSystem is an ordered
collection of rules and facts.

00:47:03.636 --> 00:47:07.586 A:middle
To assert facts about the world,
simply call evaluate on it.

00:47:08.496 --> 00:47:11.496 A:middle
This will to run through
the rules in the array

00:47:11.496 --> 00:47:14.136 A:middle
and those rules will use a
state dictionary as input

00:47:14.136 --> 00:47:16.776 A:middle
and insert facts later
based off of that.

00:47:17.806 --> 00:47:21.586 A:middle
The facts will be held in the
facts array and it's important

00:47:21.586 --> 00:47:24.396 A:middle
to know that whenever a fact
is asserted the evaluate will

00:47:24.396 --> 00:47:26.086 A:middle
actually go back
to the beginning,

00:47:26.386 --> 00:47:27.506 A:middle
and continue evaluating.

00:47:28.596 --> 00:47:30.646 A:middle
This is because when
you assert a fact,

00:47:30.726 --> 00:47:32.346 A:middle
this may affect the
way other rules work.

00:47:34.776 --> 00:47:37.326 A:middle
This ensures that when evaluate
is finished you know you have

00:47:37.476 --> 00:47:41.456 A:middle
the most concise and
accurate view of the game.

00:47:41.676 --> 00:47:44.916 A:middle
To start over again, like maybe
at the end of an update loop

00:47:45.036 --> 00:47:48.716 A:middle
or on a timer, simply call reset
and will clear up old facts

00:47:48.776 --> 00:47:50.706 A:middle
so that you can repeat
the evaluation.

00:47:50.706 --> 00:47:55.396 A:middle
Let's have a look
at the code example.

00:47:56.926 --> 00:47:59.666 A:middle
Here in the beginning, we
initialize our rule system,

00:47:59.936 --> 00:48:02.286 A:middle
and then later we
access the state



00:47:59.936 --> 00:48:02.286 A:middle
and then later we
access the state

00:48:02.846 --> 00:48:06.416 A:middle
and assert two facts
based off this.

00:48:06.646 --> 00:48:09.416 A:middle
Later in the game
code, excuse me.

00:48:09.826 --> 00:48:12.556 A:middle
We then grab these two
grades and sum them together

00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:14.616 A:middle
to get a sort of
fuzzy approximation

00:48:14.616 --> 00:48:15.916 A:middle
about how much we
should accelerate,

00:48:16.426 --> 00:48:17.676 A:middle
and feed this in our game code.

00:48:17.676 --> 00:48:24.056 A:middle
So let's take a look at
little example we have going.

00:48:44.046 --> 00:48:46.626 A:middle
Here we've got cars
driving along the freeway.

00:48:48.066 --> 00:48:50.246 A:middle
The cars in the intersections
are using one set of rules,

00:48:50.246 --> 00:48:52.296 A:middle
and the cars on the freeway
are using a different set.

00:48:52.866 --> 00:48:55.906 A:middle
The ones on the freeway are
deciding how much they should

00:48:55.906 --> 00:48:57.956 A:middle
slow down or speed up
based off the distance

00:48:57.956 --> 00:48:58.856 A:middle
of the car in front.

00:48:59.966 --> 00:49:01.366 A:middle
They're asserting two
facts about the world.



00:48:59.966 --> 00:49:01.366 A:middle
They're asserting two
facts about the world.

00:49:01.986 --> 00:49:04.596 A:middle
These are things like
distance, relative speed.

00:49:05.986 --> 00:49:07.926 A:middle
The cars in the intersection are
using a different set of rules

00:49:07.966 --> 00:49:11.456 A:middle
and asserting facts on
who has the right of way.

00:49:13.126 --> 00:49:19.756 A:middle
Putting them altogether we can
get very complex simulations

00:49:19.756 --> 00:49:20.596 A:middle
about the world.

00:49:20.596 --> 00:49:23.256 A:middle
This is a power of rule systems.

00:49:38.046 --> 00:49:39.256 A:middle
So before I go just
some best practices

00:49:39.256 --> 00:49:40.136 A:middle
on using the rule systems.

00:49:40.186 --> 00:49:43.536 A:middle
It is important to remember
that GKRuleSystem is isolated.

00:49:43.536 --> 00:49:45.636 A:middle
You should be using
the state dictionary

00:49:45.636 --> 00:49:46.786 A:middle
as a snapshot of the game world.

00:49:48.326 --> 00:49:50.956 A:middle
You should also use many simple
rules and assert many facts

00:49:50.956 --> 00:49:52.156 A:middle
about the game world as opposed

00:49:52.156 --> 00:49:54.566 A:middle
to large complex
rules and fewer facts.

00:49:55.256 --> 00:49:58.596 A:middle
It is also important to note
that facts are approximations

00:49:58.596 --> 00:50:00.716 A:middle
and it is up to you to decide
how you should use them.



00:49:58.596 --> 00:50:00.716 A:middle
and it is up to you to decide
how you should use them.

00:50:01.626 --> 00:50:03.496 A:middle
The grade of a fact is the
system's confidence in it,

00:50:04.016 --> 00:50:06.216 A:middle
and this allows us
to use fuzzy logic

00:50:06.216 --> 00:50:07.896 A:middle
to achieve more complex
reasoning.

00:50:08.996 --> 00:50:12.386 A:middle
With that, I would
like to hand it back

00:50:12.386 --> 00:50:14.256 A:middle
to my colleague Bruno
to finish up.

00:50:15.516 --> 00:50:20.006 A:middle

00:50:20.506 --> 00:50:21.026 A:middle
&gt;&gt; BRUNO SOMMER: Thanks, Josh.

00:50:24.086 --> 00:50:25.056 A:middle
So that's GameplayKit.

00:50:25.656 --> 00:50:28.626 A:middle
Today we talked about the seven
major systems in GameplayKit,

00:50:29.166 --> 00:50:31.016 A:middle
entities and components
which are a really great way

00:50:31.016 --> 00:50:32.226 A:middle
to structure your game logic.

00:50:32.766 --> 00:50:35.366 A:middle
State machines which deal with
the statefulness in our games

00:50:35.366 --> 00:50:37.466 A:middle
and the various state changes
that our objects undergo.

00:50:37.986 --> 00:50:41.696 A:middle
Agents, which are our
autonomously moving entities

00:50:41.696 --> 00:50:44.076 A:middle
controlled by realistic
behaviors and goals.

00:50:45.306 --> 00:50:47.646 A:middle
Pathfinding, which deals with
navigation graph generation

00:50:47.796 --> 00:50:49.336 A:middle
and finding paths
within our game world.

00:50:50.496 --> 00:50:52.896 A:middle
We also talked about our
great MinMax AI solution,

00:50:53.056 --> 00:50:53.846 A:middle
which helps you give life

00:50:53.846 --> 00:50:55.216 A:middle
to your computer
controlled opponents.

00:50:56.226 --> 00:51:00.116 A:middle
Also the slew of great random
sources and distributions



00:50:56.226 --> 00:51:00.116 A:middle
Also the slew of great random
sources and distributions

00:51:00.246 --> 00:51:01.596 A:middle
that are available to you.

00:51:01.896 --> 00:51:04.146 A:middle
Lastly we talked about rule
systems which are a great way

00:51:04.396 --> 00:51:06.766 A:middle
to describe discreet
and fuzzy logic.

00:51:08.046 --> 00:51:10.396 A:middle
We really are excited to finally
get GameplayKit in your hands

00:51:10.476 --> 00:51:13.006 A:middle
and can't wait to see
what you make with it.

00:51:15.636 --> 00:51:17.396 A:middle
Some great code samples
dropped this week,

00:51:17.526 --> 00:51:18.866 A:middle
you should definitely
check it out if you want

00:51:18.866 --> 00:51:20.236 A:middle
to learn a little more.

00:51:20.746 --> 00:51:23.376 A:middle
DemoBots is a SpriteKit
game covers a wide variety

00:51:23.376 --> 00:51:26.686 A:middle
of the GameplayKit API,
FourInARow is a good example

00:51:26.686 --> 00:51:28.036 A:middle
of MinMax AI in action,

00:51:28.276 --> 00:51:30.256 A:middle
and AgentsCatalog is
a really good example

00:51:30.256 --> 00:51:32.866 A:middle
of the agent's behaviors and
goals, so definitely check

00:51:32.866 --> 00:51:35.436 A:middle
that out if you want
to learn a little more.

00:51:36.056 --> 00:51:38.396 A:middle
There is also some sessions
coming up if you want to find

00:51:38.396 --> 00:51:40.766 A:middle
out a little more about our
related technologies, SpriteKit,

00:51:40.966 --> 00:51:43.306 A:middle
ReplayKit, Game Center,
SceneKit.

00:51:43.786 --> 00:51:46.246 A:middle
After lunch today we have
a deeper dive into DemoBots

00:51:46.246 --> 00:51:48.406 A:middle
which is that sample I talked
about, so definitely check

00:51:48.406 --> 00:51:49.946 A:middle
that out if you want to
learn a little bit more

00:51:50.086 --> 00:51:51.866 A:middle
about GameplayKit or SpriteKit.

00:51:52.976 --> 00:51:55.266 A:middle
There is also some
great labs coming up,

00:51:55.586 --> 00:51:56.846 A:middle
check out the Game
Controllers lab.

00:51:57.096 --> 00:51:59.216 A:middle
There is also a GameplayKit
lab today after lunch,

00:51:59.786 --> 00:52:01.726 A:middle
meet the team, ask questions,



00:51:59.786 --> 00:52:01.726 A:middle
meet the team, ask questions,

00:52:01.946 --> 00:52:03.946 A:middle
talk about any problems you
might have with the code.

00:52:04.596 --> 00:52:08.026 A:middle
If you need anymore information,
we direct you to check

00:52:08.026 --> 00:52:09.146 A:middle
out our great developer site

00:52:09.856 --> 00:52:12.056 A:middle
and for any general inquiries
contact Allan Schaffer,

00:52:12.056 --> 00:52:13.796 A:middle
