00:00:26.096 --> 00:00:26.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; DAVE VAN TASSELL:
Good morning.

00:00:28.186 --> 00:00:28.656 A:middle
Good morning.

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:31.016 A:middle
Welcome to What's New
in iTunes Connect.

00:00:31.436 --> 00:00:32.526 A:middle
I am Dave Van Tassell,

00:00:32.656 --> 00:00:35.016 A:middle
Engineering Manager
here at iTunes Connect.

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:38.246 A:middle
I am excited to tell you what we
have been up to this past year

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:42.476 A:middle
and where we are headed.

00:00:42.716 --> 00:00:44.326 A:middle
As many of you have noticed,

00:00:44.326 --> 00:00:46.906 A:middle
we started localizing iTunes
Connect over the past year.

00:00:47.256 --> 00:00:50.766 A:middle
We've added languages such
as Chinese, German, Japanese,

00:00:51.236 --> 00:00:53.496 A:middle
French, Spanish, Korean.

00:00:54.156 --> 00:00:56.966 A:middle
Just this week we added our
fourteenth language, Thai.

00:00:58.116 --> 00:01:00.676 A:middle
This is a long process, and
we are just getting started.



00:00:58.116 --> 00:01:00.676 A:middle
This is a long process, and
we are just getting started.

00:01:01.506 --> 00:01:02.956 A:middle
We can clap for localization.

00:01:02.956 --> 00:01:03.836 A:middle
That's okay.

00:01:04.476 --> 00:01:07.196 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:01:07.696 --> 00:01:09.026 A:middle
As you sign in to
iTunes Connect,

00:01:09.216 --> 00:01:11.896 A:middle
we come to our Home page,
and I want to start today

00:01:12.356 --> 00:01:16.196 A:middle
by talking briefly about a few
of the areas we made changes in.

00:01:16.196 --> 00:01:17.826 A:middle
We are making changes
across the whole site.

00:01:17.826 --> 00:01:18.976 A:middle
We don't have time
for everything.

00:01:18.976 --> 00:01:21.946 A:middle
So let's start with
three to begin with.

00:01:22.556 --> 00:01:24.076 A:middle
The first is App Analytics.

00:01:24.656 --> 00:01:27.366 A:middle
We launched it earlier
this year,

00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.146 A:middle
and it's become the best place

00:01:29.146 --> 00:01:31.136 A:middle
to measure acquisition
to engagement.

00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:34.006 A:middle
And it requires no
code from you,

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:37.536 A:middle
all the while protecting your
and our customers' privacy.

00:01:38.246 --> 00:01:42.306 A:middle
If you have more questions
about App Analytics, what it is,

00:01:42.306 --> 00:01:44.756 A:middle
how it can help you, and
where we are going with that,

00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:48.926 A:middle
there's a great session right
after lunch, Getting the Most

00:01:48.926 --> 00:01:51.396 A:middle
Out of App Analytics,
with Tristan and David.

00:01:51.396 --> 00:01:52.866 A:middle
I highly recommend it.

00:01:55.296 --> 00:01:57.876 A:middle
The second area is
agreements, tax, and banking.

00:01:58.496 --> 00:02:01.786 A:middle
As you may have heard,
we've unified our agreement.



00:01:58.496 --> 00:02:01.786 A:middle
As you may have heard,
we've unified our agreement.

00:02:02.326 --> 00:02:04.696 A:middle
With one agreement,
you have access

00:02:04.696 --> 00:02:06.176 A:middle
to both the Mac and iOS SDKs.

00:02:06.176 --> 00:02:08.856 A:middle
You go to the dev
portal, sign in,

00:02:09.816 --> 00:02:11.696 A:middle
you agree to the
single agreement.

00:02:12.506 --> 00:02:14.956 A:middle
Come into iTunes Connect,
and you set up your tax

00:02:14.956 --> 00:02:17.146 A:middle
and banking information
just for that one contract,

00:02:17.476 --> 00:02:18.596 A:middle
letting you set up paid apps

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:22.366 A:middle
and paid in-app purchases
for both Mac and iOS.

00:02:25.256 --> 00:02:28.026 A:middle
The third area I want to talk
about is resources and help.

00:02:28.026 --> 00:02:32.056 A:middle
We are overhauling our
support part of the site,

00:02:32.056 --> 00:02:34.176 A:middle
and the best part is
an integrated search.

00:02:34.346 --> 00:02:38.146 A:middle
This will work not only
across FAQs and guides,

00:02:38.206 --> 00:02:40.256 A:middle
but also the news
and announcements

00:02:41.076 --> 00:02:43.406 A:middle
for iTunes Connect,
both past and current.

00:02:44.186 --> 00:02:47.236 A:middle
And to make this even better,
we are integrating our guides

00:02:47.336 --> 00:02:49.946 A:middle
as web pages as opposed
to downloadable PDFs.

00:02:49.946 --> 00:02:52.866 A:middle
We are going to move all
of this content outside

00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:56.586 A:middle
of the iTunes Connect login
so you can access it and link

00:02:56.586 --> 00:02:59.946 A:middle
to these pages from
wherever you want.



00:03:01.476 --> 00:03:05.366 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:07.486 A:middle
For the rest of the
presentation, we want to focus

00:03:07.486 --> 00:03:11.066 A:middle
on two other areas, My
Apps and users and roles.

00:03:11.486 --> 00:03:13.196 A:middle
Let's start with My Apps.

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:18.256 A:middle
We are introducing a cleaner
organization to the tabs inside

00:03:18.256 --> 00:03:20.736 A:middle
of My Apps, as well
as a pricing redesign,

00:03:22.346 --> 00:03:23.656 A:middle
and some TestFlight updates.

00:03:25.016 --> 00:03:26.496 A:middle
So starting with
the organization.

00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:30.806 A:middle
Today iTunes Connect is broken
into seven distinct tabs:

00:03:32.026 --> 00:03:37.576 A:middle
Versions, Pricing, Prerelease,
In-App Purchases, Game Center,

00:03:37.756 --> 00:03:39.186 A:middle
Reviews, and Newsstand.

00:03:39.256 --> 00:03:41.856 A:middle
And we want to simplify
this a little bit.

00:03:42.726 --> 00:03:43.366 A:middle
First off, we are going

00:03:43.366 --> 00:03:45.836 A:middle
to create a new tab called App
Store, and we are going to put

00:03:45.836 --> 00:03:47.246 A:middle
in your version information,

00:03:47.246 --> 00:03:49.426 A:middle
pricing information,
as well as reviews.

00:03:50.706 --> 00:03:52.636 A:middle
Then we are going to move
all the In-App Purchases,

00:03:52.636 --> 00:03:55.136 A:middle
Game Center, and
Newsstand features

00:03:55.136 --> 00:03:57.046 A:middle
into a tab called Features.

00:03:57.476 --> 00:04:01.736 A:middle
Second, we are going to
take Prerelease and split it



00:03:57.476 --> 00:04:01.736 A:middle
Second, we are going to
take Prerelease and split it

00:04:01.736 --> 00:04:03.206 A:middle
into its two distinct areas:

00:04:04.006 --> 00:04:06.276 A:middle
TestFlight for managing
your internal

00:04:06.336 --> 00:04:08.816 A:middle
and external tester
information as well

00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:11.886 A:middle
as your TestFlight
builds, and also Activity,

00:04:11.886 --> 00:04:14.196 A:middle
where you can get information
on all of your builds,

00:04:14.196 --> 00:04:15.856 A:middle
whether they went
through TestFlight or not,

00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:24.546 A:middle
as well as your version status
history and Resolution Center.

00:04:24.696 --> 00:04:27.336 A:middle
Looking more into App Store,
in your version information,

00:04:27.336 --> 00:04:28.266 A:middle
there's a lot of metadata

00:04:28.266 --> 00:04:31.026 A:middle
to get your app ready
for the App Store.

00:04:31.606 --> 00:04:35.046 A:middle
Some of this information, it
changes from version to version

00:04:35.046 --> 00:04:37.436 A:middle
to version, such as
your What's New text,

00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:39.746 A:middle
your description,
or your screenshots.

00:04:41.036 --> 00:04:43.216 A:middle
Other information
tends to stay the same,

00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:45.626 A:middle
your app name, categories, EULA.

00:04:45.626 --> 00:04:49.996 A:middle
We want to break this into two
separate lists, your app info

00:04:49.996 --> 00:04:51.216 A:middle
and your version information.

00:04:52.296 --> 00:04:54.206 A:middle
Both of these lists
will be reviewed

00:04:54.206 --> 00:04:55.866 A:middle
with each version
submission, but we are going

00:04:55.866 --> 00:04:58.586 A:middle
to separate two distinct
areas under App Store,

00:04:58.926 --> 00:05:00.276 A:middle
App Info and Versions.



00:04:58.926 --> 00:05:00.276 A:middle
App Info and Versions.

00:05:00.726 --> 00:05:05.606 A:middle
Next under Versions, I want
to talk about version release.

00:05:06.166 --> 00:05:09.716 A:middle
When you submit your
app to App Review,

00:05:10.216 --> 00:05:11.996 A:middle
you decide what happens
after it's approved.

00:05:13.196 --> 00:05:15.266 A:middle
You can have automatically
release as soon

00:05:15.266 --> 00:05:16.986 A:middle
as App Review has
approved your version.

00:05:17.206 --> 00:05:19.176 A:middle
We begin processing for
App Store right away

00:05:19.176 --> 00:05:21.086 A:middle
and enter Ready for Sale.

00:05:22.316 --> 00:05:25.606 A:middle
Alternatively, you can choose
to manually release your app.

00:05:25.736 --> 00:05:28.356 A:middle
When you do this, after App
Review has approved your app,

00:05:28.656 --> 00:05:30.166 A:middle
it goes into Pending
Developer Release.

00:05:30.916 --> 00:05:34.446 A:middle
At this point, you can
continue to invite internal

00:05:34.446 --> 00:05:36.356 A:middle
and external testers
through TestFlight;

00:05:37.536 --> 00:05:40.506 A:middle
you can request promo codes,
and they will download this new

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:42.576 A:middle
and improved version as
opposed to the one live

00:05:42.576 --> 00:05:45.806 A:middle
in the App Store; and if
you find any critical bugs,

00:05:46.136 --> 00:05:50.386 A:middle
you can dev reject your app,
fix the bug, upload and submit,

00:05:50.386 --> 00:05:51.406 A:middle
and put it back into the system.

00:05:52.296 --> 00:05:53.796 A:middle
Whenever you are ready
to release your app,

00:05:53.796 --> 00:05:56.196 A:middle
you log into iTunes
Connect, and you decide

00:05:56.196 --> 00:05:58.486 A:middle
at what point it begins
processing for App Store

00:05:58.486 --> 00:05:59.396 A:middle
and enter ready for sale.



00:06:00.116 --> 00:06:02.186 A:middle
We are adding a third
new option,

00:06:02.366 --> 00:06:04.826 A:middle
which is called Scheduled
Release, and for this,

00:06:04.826 --> 00:06:08.306 A:middle
you can choose the date and
time when your app will move

00:06:08.306 --> 00:06:09.376 A:middle
through processing
for App Store.

00:06:10.016 --> 00:06:12.346 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:06:12.846 --> 00:06:15.036 A:middle
So just like manual
release, after it's approved,

00:06:15.036 --> 00:06:16.626 A:middle
it's going to go into
Pending Developer Release,

00:06:17.346 --> 00:06:22.556 A:middle
but instead of you logging into
iTunes Connect, we'll move it

00:06:22.556 --> 00:06:23.956 A:middle
for you at that given
date and time.

00:06:24.796 --> 00:06:26.506 A:middle
And iTunes Connect is
going to look like this

00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:27.376 A:middle
under the Version tab.

00:06:28.576 --> 00:06:30.646 A:middle
Come in here and
select which option

00:06:30.646 --> 00:06:32.146 A:middle
of version release
control you want.

00:06:35.856 --> 00:06:38.726 A:middle
So we now have three choices.

00:06:39.986 --> 00:06:43.636 A:middle
Automatically release goes
as soon as it's approved.

00:06:44.626 --> 00:06:48.056 A:middle
The second is a manual release,
you log into iTunes Connect

00:06:48.056 --> 00:06:49.306 A:middle
and click "release
this version,"

00:06:50.626 --> 00:06:53.786 A:middle
and the third is a scheduled
release, where after approval

00:06:54.286 --> 00:06:57.746 A:middle
and after your selected date
and time, then we release it

00:06:57.746 --> 00:06:58.776 A:middle
for processing to App Store.

00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:03.786 A:middle
Let's talk about
some pricing updates.



00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:03.786 A:middle
Let's talk about
some pricing updates.

00:07:04.196 --> 00:07:05.856 A:middle
Longtime users of
iTunes Connect,

00:07:06.046 --> 00:07:08.446 A:middle
you know we haven't made
a lot of changes to the UI

00:07:08.446 --> 00:07:09.856 A:middle
on the pricing section.

00:07:11.346 --> 00:07:15.996 A:middle
So along with a general redesign
of this page, I want to call

00:07:15.996 --> 00:07:17.806 A:middle
out some more subtle
features we are adding.

00:07:18.766 --> 00:07:21.636 A:middle
The first is in selecting
your tier.

00:07:21.636 --> 00:07:25.916 A:middle
We are going to add in the
customer price into the tier

00:07:25.916 --> 00:07:27.376 A:middle
in your preferred currency.

00:07:28.776 --> 00:07:29.946 A:middle
What is a preferred currency?

00:07:30.106 --> 00:07:32.696 A:middle
This is an iTunes Connect user
setting where you can choose

00:07:32.696 --> 00:07:34.896 A:middle
which currency we are going to
show in that tiered drop-down.

00:07:34.896 --> 00:07:37.786 A:middle
We are going to start it based
off of your contract location,

00:07:37.816 --> 00:07:42.656 A:middle
but you can log into iTunes
Connect and change it anytime.

00:07:42.756 --> 00:07:47.546 A:middle
Once you've selected your
currency, you can view

00:07:47.546 --> 00:07:51.226 A:middle
that same tier and all
the other currencies.

00:07:52.676 --> 00:07:54.656 A:middle
We've also made a
change to the All Prices

00:07:54.656 --> 00:07:55.566 A:middle
and Currencies section.

00:07:56.136 --> 00:08:00.076 A:middle
Here you can select up to
five different currencies



00:07:56.136 --> 00:08:00.076 A:middle
Here you can select up to
five different currencies

00:08:00.076 --> 00:08:05.336 A:middle
and see them side by side on the
screen, across all of the tiers

00:08:05.336 --> 00:08:06.576 A:middle
for these five currencies.

00:08:07.056 --> 00:08:09.246 A:middle
With that, I want to invite
Jennifer Stuart onto the stage,

00:08:09.246 --> 00:08:10.666 A:middle
and she is going to
give us a demo of some

00:08:10.666 --> 00:08:12.536 A:middle
of these new features
in iTunes Connect.

00:08:12.536 --> 00:08:12.856 A:middle
Jennifer [Applause].

00:08:13.556 --> 00:08:13.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER STUART: Hi.

00:08:13.966 --> 00:08:14.406 A:middle
I'm Jennifer.

00:08:15.046 --> 00:08:16.006 A:middle
I am going to walk
you through some

00:08:16.006 --> 00:08:17.876 A:middle
of the changes we have
coming up in iTunes Connect.

00:08:18.806 --> 00:08:21.616 A:middle
So I have an app in the
App Store, and according

00:08:21.616 --> 00:08:23.956 A:middle
to App Analytics, it's
doing really well in Italy,

00:08:24.486 --> 00:08:25.776 A:middle
but I think I can
do even better,

00:08:25.776 --> 00:08:28.056 A:middle
and localizing my app
will really do the job,

00:08:28.056 --> 00:08:29.646 A:middle
so I am going to
do three things.

00:08:30.116 --> 00:08:33.876 A:middle
The first thing I am going to
do is boost my marketing efforts

00:08:34.316 --> 00:08:35.836 A:middle
by localizing my app in Italian.

00:08:36.535 --> 00:08:40.216 A:middle
The second thing I am going to
do is carefully time the release

00:08:40.216 --> 00:08:42.446 A:middle
of this new version to coincide

00:08:42.446 --> 00:08:44.526 A:middle
with some other marketing
efforts I have in place.

00:08:45.136 --> 00:08:48.136 A:middle
The third thing I am going to
do is set up a special price

00:08:48.136 --> 00:08:49.196 A:middle
for the week of this
new release.

00:08:49.776 --> 00:08:50.556 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:59.946 A:middle
Okay. So we are starting off
at the My Apps page here,

00:08:59.946 --> 00:09:03.116 A:middle
and I can see - I'm
going to go into my apps.



00:08:59.946 --> 00:09:03.116 A:middle
and I can see - I'm
going to go into my apps.

00:09:03.116 --> 00:09:06.046 A:middle
I can see my app here,
TouchFighter III.

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:07.686 A:middle
I will click on it.

00:09:09.866 --> 00:09:11.236 A:middle
As Dave explained,

00:09:11.476 --> 00:09:13.246 A:middle
app information has
the metadata fields

00:09:13.246 --> 00:09:14.736 A:middle
that get updated
less frequently,

00:09:15.106 --> 00:09:16.826 A:middle
so these fields are
now on their own page.

00:09:17.336 --> 00:09:19.596 A:middle
Our first task is to
create a new localization.

00:09:19.596 --> 00:09:22.036 A:middle
I am going to click on the
locale here on the right,

00:09:22.776 --> 00:09:26.046 A:middle
and that will show
us localizations

00:09:26.046 --> 00:09:27.096 A:middle
that we have been set up for.

00:09:27.146 --> 00:09:30.346 A:middle
You will see that Italian
is not in this list,

00:09:30.346 --> 00:09:31.686 A:middle
and I can't create it just yet.

00:09:31.686 --> 00:09:33.376 A:middle
I will need to create
a new version.

00:09:33.866 --> 00:09:37.136 A:middle
So on the left nav here, I am
going to click on New Version.

00:09:37.136 --> 00:09:41.766 A:middle
We get a modal asking for
a new store version number.

00:09:41.766 --> 00:09:47.506 A:middle
I am going to give it 1.0.3,
and then click Create.

00:09:52.276 --> 00:09:54.486 A:middle
This will create the
new version for my app,

00:09:54.486 --> 00:09:55.876 A:middle
and I will also be brought right

00:09:55.876 --> 00:09:57.316 A:middle
to the version's
specific details.



00:10:06.716 --> 00:10:09.406 A:middle
I have my English text
ready for What's New.

00:10:09.946 --> 00:10:14.996 A:middle
And now I am ready to create
my Italian localization.

00:10:14.996 --> 00:10:17.736 A:middle
I will click on the
locale here and scroll

00:10:17.736 --> 00:10:18.796 A:middle
down and find Italian.

00:10:22.126 --> 00:10:23.676 A:middle
And that adds my localization.

00:10:23.676 --> 00:10:26.316 A:middle
I have my What's New text
also for that ready to go.

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:31.876 A:middle
So the next thing I wanted

00:10:31.876 --> 00:10:34.376 A:middle
to do was carefully time the
release of this new version.

00:10:34.376 --> 00:10:36.476 A:middle
So I am going to scroll
down to version release,

00:10:36.476 --> 00:10:38.016 A:middle
which is towards the
bottom of the page.

00:10:42.876 --> 00:10:46.476 A:middle
So before we just had the two
options, manual and automatic.

00:10:47.216 --> 00:10:51.216 A:middle
With manual release, after my
app was approved by App Review,

00:10:51.596 --> 00:10:53.676 A:middle
I would need to remember to
come in on the day I wanted

00:10:53.676 --> 00:10:55.056 A:middle
to release my app
to the App Store.

00:10:55.956 --> 00:10:58.886 A:middle
With automatic, it would release
automatically, but maybe not

00:10:58.886 --> 00:11:00.366 A:middle
on the exact day
I had planned for.



00:10:58.886 --> 00:11:00.366 A:middle
on the exact day
I had planned for.

00:11:01.016 --> 00:11:04.896 A:middle
So with this new option, I
can set up a date and time

00:11:05.066 --> 00:11:08.346 A:middle
for when I want it to release,
and it will move to Processing

00:11:08.516 --> 00:11:10.476 A:middle
for App Store on
that date and time.

00:11:11.256 --> 00:11:11.966 A:middle
After App Review.

00:11:12.636 --> 00:11:15.946 A:middle
So I am going to select July
1 here in the date drop-down.

00:11:20.886 --> 00:11:25.676 A:middle
And this is based on my local
date and time, just so you know

00:11:25.676 --> 00:11:27.436 A:middle
that when you are setting
that up for your app.

00:11:28.266 --> 00:11:30.926 A:middle
So I think everything
looks good here,

00:11:30.926 --> 00:11:40.476 A:middle
so I am going to click on Save.

00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:42.996 A:middle
And the last thing I wanted to
do was set up a special price

00:11:42.996 --> 00:11:44.826 A:middle
for this new version's
launch date.

00:11:45.386 --> 00:11:47.256 A:middle
To do that, I am going
to click on Pricing

00:11:47.256 --> 00:11:49.466 A:middle
and Availability
in the left nav.

00:11:51.716 --> 00:11:53.436 A:middle
You will see we have
this All Prices

00:11:53.436 --> 00:11:54.856 A:middle
and Currencies link
on the right.

00:11:54.926 --> 00:11:56.446 A:middle
I am going to click
and open that up.

00:11:58.246 --> 00:11:59.956 A:middle
So I can take a look
at all the price tiers



00:12:00.396 --> 00:12:02.206 A:middle
and what the price tier
will be in each storefront,

00:12:02.496 --> 00:12:04.496 A:middle
and I can change what
storefronts I'm comparing

00:12:04.496 --> 00:12:06.316 A:middle
by clicking on the
storefront name at the top.

00:12:06.316 --> 00:12:08.916 A:middle
I am going to go and
select Italy here

00:12:09.546 --> 00:12:14.746 A:middle
to see how the different tiers
compare in that storefront.

00:12:14.746 --> 00:12:16.836 A:middle
And I can see my
proceeds as well.

00:12:17.056 --> 00:12:21.056 A:middle
So I think I know which
tier I am going to move

00:12:21.056 --> 00:12:22.546 A:middle
to for my special price.

00:12:22.546 --> 00:12:23.686 A:middle
I am going to close this window.

00:12:25.396 --> 00:12:28.586 A:middle
And now I am going to click
on Plan a Price Change.

00:12:30.226 --> 00:12:34.896 A:middle
And here, under Price, I
am going to select Tier 1.

00:12:35.636 --> 00:12:37.826 A:middle
And you will see that we have
this Other Currencies link here

00:12:37.826 --> 00:12:42.356 A:middle
below, and now I can see what
this tier will look like,

00:12:42.356 --> 00:12:45.456 A:middle
what the price will be, and
what my proceeds will be

00:12:45.456 --> 00:12:46.886 A:middle
in each storefront
for this tier.

00:12:48.396 --> 00:12:52.446 A:middle
So again, we have our marketing
plan going on for July 1,

00:12:53.186 --> 00:12:56.406 A:middle
so I will go ahead and select
July 1 here, and we are going

00:12:56.406 --> 00:12:58.646 A:middle
to run this special
price for a week.

00:12:58.966 --> 00:13:01.466 A:middle
So I am going to go
and select July 8



00:12:58.966 --> 00:13:01.466 A:middle
So I am going to go
and select July 8

00:13:01.536 --> 00:13:03.616 A:middle
and the end date
and then click Done.

00:13:06.876 --> 00:13:09.556 A:middle
So you can see that the app
will go on sale on July 1

00:13:09.826 --> 00:13:12.046 A:middle
and then return to its original
price at the end of the week.

00:13:12.526 --> 00:13:14.436 A:middle
This all looks good to me,
so I am going to go ahead

00:13:14.436 --> 00:13:15.946 A:middle
and click Save at
the top corner.

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:20.526 A:middle
So that completes
all our main tasks.

00:13:20.526 --> 00:13:21.686 A:middle
And just so you are aware,

00:13:21.686 --> 00:13:24.786 A:middle
everything I've done just now
can also be done via XML feed.

00:13:25.116 --> 00:13:26.996 A:middle
If you'd like to learn more
about how to make these kinds

00:13:26.996 --> 00:13:28.666 A:middle
of updates via XML, check

00:13:28.666 --> 00:13:30.726 A:middle
out the session called
iTunes Connect: Development

00:13:30.726 --> 00:13:33.026 A:middle
and Distribution at 3:30
in the Mission Room.

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:34.666 A:middle
There will be a portion
of that session

00:13:34.666 --> 00:13:35.756 A:middle
that covers this process.

00:13:35.756 --> 00:13:39.096 A:middle
Now I will walk you through
some additional changes we have

00:13:39.096 --> 00:13:39.916 A:middle
in iTunes Connect.

00:13:40.106 --> 00:13:42.636 A:middle
I am going to go
under Features tab.

00:13:42.956 --> 00:13:45.736 A:middle
If I have an in-app
purchase that I want

00:13:45.736 --> 00:13:50.316 A:middle
to also add a localization
to, I can go to Features

00:13:50.316 --> 00:13:53.206 A:middle
and In-App Purchases, and this
will list my in-app purchases

00:13:53.206 --> 00:13:56.966 A:middle
that I have for this app, and I
can create new ones by clicking

00:13:56.966 --> 00:13:59.696 A:middle
on the plus symbol next to
the header, or I can click

00:13:59.696 --> 00:14:01.266 A:middle
on the name to add
the localization.



00:13:59.696 --> 00:14:01.266 A:middle
on the name to add
the localization.

00:14:02.116 --> 00:14:05.546 A:middle
As well, we have Game Center
under Features as well.

00:14:06.616 --> 00:14:08.836 A:middle
And here I can see my
leaderboards and achievements

00:14:09.276 --> 00:14:11.316 A:middle
and create new ones by
clicking the plus symbol next

00:14:11.316 --> 00:14:11.756 A:middle
to the header.

00:14:13.066 --> 00:14:14.626 A:middle
We also have Newsstand
in this section.

00:14:14.626 --> 00:14:15.806 A:middle
If this was a Newsstand app,

00:14:15.806 --> 00:14:17.476 A:middle
I can manage my Newsstand
issues there.

00:14:18.736 --> 00:14:22.156 A:middle
I can also see the builds I
have uploaded under Activity.

00:14:22.706 --> 00:14:24.116 A:middle
These are the builds
I have uploaded

00:14:24.116 --> 00:14:25.606 A:middle
for each version
would be shown here.

00:14:26.196 --> 00:14:30.296 A:middle
As Dave mentioned, we've
also updated the Resources

00:14:30.296 --> 00:14:33.046 A:middle
and Help section, so
let's take a look at that.

00:14:44.456 --> 00:14:47.276 A:middle
So you don't even need to be
logged into iTunes Connect now

00:14:47.276 --> 00:14:48.216 A:middle
to access this content.

00:14:48.636 --> 00:14:50.026 A:middle
There's four main sections here.

00:14:50.026 --> 00:14:52.236 A:middle
In the News section, you
can read about updates

00:14:52.236 --> 00:14:55.026 A:middle
to iTunes Connect and the latest
information about the App Store.

00:14:55.626 --> 00:14:57.676 A:middle
There's a Video section
where I can watch tutorials

00:14:57.676 --> 00:14:58.856 A:middle
and feature walkthroughs.

00:14:59.456 --> 00:15:01.246 A:middle
You can find style
guides, checklists,



00:14:59.456 --> 00:15:01.246 A:middle
You can find style
guides, checklists,

00:15:01.246 --> 00:15:03.076 A:middle
and sample content
in the Guide section.

00:15:03.586 --> 00:15:07.106 A:middle
Lastly, look for your answers to
your questions in the FAQ area.

00:15:07.546 --> 00:15:09.616 A:middle
Most recently updated
questions will get badged,

00:15:09.616 --> 00:15:10.936 A:middle
so you can easily find those.

00:15:11.676 --> 00:15:13.926 A:middle
The great thing is we
have a Search field here

00:15:13.926 --> 00:15:15.626 A:middle
that will search
across all the areas,

00:15:15.626 --> 00:15:18.616 A:middle
and you can find exactly what
you need easy and quickly.

00:15:18.766 --> 00:15:22.276 A:middle
So I am going to type in
Trends and see what we got.

00:15:22.276 --> 00:15:26.116 A:middle
So you can see we get responses
from all the different areas.

00:15:27.006 --> 00:15:29.116 A:middle
So that gives you a little
preview of what we have coming

00:15:29.116 --> 00:15:30.576 A:middle
up for iTunes Connect,
and with that,

00:15:30.576 --> 00:15:32.726 A:middle
I will give the floor
back to Dave.

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:41.336 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:15:41.836 --> 00:15:42.756 A:middle
&gt;&gt; DAVE VAN TASSELL:
Thank you, Jennifer.

00:15:42.926 --> 00:15:45.486 A:middle
We are excited about
these changes

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:46.946 A:middle
that we're making
to iTunes Connect.

00:15:49.136 --> 00:15:50.626 A:middle
Let's talk a little
bit about TestFlight.

00:15:51.276 --> 00:15:54.466 A:middle
One person likes TestFlight.

00:15:55.126 --> 00:15:56.146 A:middle
[Applause] There we go.

00:15:58.996 --> 00:16:00.826 A:middle
We launched TestFlight
last year,



00:15:58.996 --> 00:16:00.826 A:middle
We launched TestFlight
last year,

00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:02.396 A:middle
and it quickly became
the best place

00:16:02.546 --> 00:16:04.136 A:middle
to beta test your iOS apps.

00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:06.576 A:middle
No provisioning profile
is required.

00:16:07.386 --> 00:16:09.436 A:middle
We automatically generate
the sandbox accounts

00:16:09.436 --> 00:16:10.726 A:middle
for your in-app purchase
testing.

00:16:11.766 --> 00:16:13.916 A:middle
And with the release of
Apple Watch this year,

00:16:14.176 --> 00:16:16.296 A:middle
TestFlight also supports
Apple Watch.

00:16:16.826 --> 00:16:19.716 A:middle
And there's two kinds of
testers for TestFlight.

00:16:19.716 --> 00:16:21.606 A:middle
You have your internal
and external testers.

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:23.056 A:middle
I want to talk a little bit

00:16:23.286 --> 00:16:25.246 A:middle
about the differences
between those.

00:16:26.976 --> 00:16:28.476 A:middle
So your first is internal.

00:16:28.906 --> 00:16:32.186 A:middle
Internal testers are your
fellow iTunes Connect users.

00:16:32.186 --> 00:16:33.556 A:middle
They are part of your team.

00:16:34.426 --> 00:16:35.706 A:middle
You invite them to TestFlight

00:16:35.706 --> 00:16:37.166 A:middle
with their iTunes
Connect user name.

00:16:37.476 --> 00:16:40.646 A:middle
But when they accept their
invitation, they accept it

00:16:40.646 --> 00:16:41.956 A:middle
with their personal
App Store account.

00:16:42.776 --> 00:16:43.886 A:middle
It doesn't have to be the same

00:16:43.886 --> 00:16:45.016 A:middle
as their iTunes Connect
user name.

00:16:46.026 --> 00:16:48.686 A:middle
There's no beta app review
for internal testing.

00:16:50.736 --> 00:16:53.856 A:middle
For external testers, all
you need is an email address,

00:16:54.186 --> 00:16:56.716 A:middle
and again, when they accept
their TestFlight invitation,

00:16:56.896 --> 00:16:59.146 A:middle
they will do so with their
personal App Store account,

00:16:59.236 --> 00:17:00.646 A:middle
which can be a different email



00:16:59.236 --> 00:17:00.646 A:middle
which can be a different email

00:17:00.646 --> 00:17:03.556 A:middle
than the one you
invited them with.

00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:04.886 A:middle
With external testing,

00:17:05.616 --> 00:17:09.465 A:middle
we do require beta app
review with new versions.

00:17:10.425 --> 00:17:11.996 A:middle
What are new versions?

00:17:12.976 --> 00:17:14.506 A:middle
Let's talk about that.

00:17:15.756 --> 00:17:18.746 A:middle
There are two keys that are
important in Xcode when talking

00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:20.665 A:middle
about TestFlight,
versions, and builds.

00:17:21.136 --> 00:17:23.486 A:middle
The first is your CFbundle
short version string.

00:17:23.996 --> 00:17:25.106 A:middle
This is your version.

00:17:25.786 --> 00:17:28.136 A:middle
And the second is the CFbundle
version, or your build.

00:17:29.456 --> 00:17:32.456 A:middle
So when you select a build
to go into external testing,

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:36.486 A:middle
let's go with version 1.0,
build 100, this is going to go

00:17:36.486 --> 00:17:39.066 A:middle
through beta app review.

00:17:39.196 --> 00:17:41.726 A:middle
As you upload and
submit subsequent builds

00:17:41.726 --> 00:17:43.176 A:middle
to the same version, we ask,

00:17:43.176 --> 00:17:45.036 A:middle
have you made any
significant changes?

00:17:45.526 --> 00:17:48.576 A:middle
And if you haven't made
any significant changes,

00:17:49.376 --> 00:17:51.396 A:middle
then the beta app review
process is much quicker

00:17:51.396 --> 00:17:52.046 A:middle
for these builds.

00:17:52.396 --> 00:17:56.326 A:middle
Once you are ready to start
inviting external testers

00:17:56.586 --> 00:18:00.786 A:middle
to a new version -- in
this case, version 1.1 --



00:17:56.586 --> 00:18:00.786 A:middle
to a new version -- in
this case, version 1.1 --

00:18:00.976 --> 00:18:04.436 A:middle
this version will go through
the same kind of beta app review

00:18:04.956 --> 00:18:10.156 A:middle
that your initial build on
version 1.0 went through.

00:18:10.386 --> 00:18:13.136 A:middle
Another difference between
internal and external testing is

00:18:13.136 --> 00:18:16.686 A:middle
which build is available
for your testers.

00:18:17.966 --> 00:18:20.926 A:middle
So for internal here,
we have version 1.0,

00:18:21.046 --> 00:18:25.046 A:middle
and it's the latest build, build
101, that is always available

00:18:25.046 --> 00:18:26.106 A:middle
for your internal testers.

00:18:27.496 --> 00:18:30.016 A:middle
As we switch to testing
version 1.1,

00:18:30.176 --> 00:18:33.206 A:middle
the last build we've uploaded,
103, is what's available.

00:18:33.326 --> 00:18:36.876 A:middle
If I upload a new build, it will
automatically be distributed

00:18:36.876 --> 00:18:37.836 A:middle
to the internal testers.

00:18:38.246 --> 00:18:42.886 A:middle
Whereas for external
testers, you get to select

00:18:43.126 --> 00:18:46.166 A:middle
which build they see, so we
can start with build 100,

00:18:46.166 --> 00:18:52.236 A:middle
move on to build 102, all the
while our internal testers were

00:18:52.236 --> 00:18:54.496 A:middle
a little bit later
on in build 103.

00:18:55.516 --> 00:18:59.396 A:middle
I'd like to turn the time
over to Jason Gregori.

00:18:59.396 --> 00:19:01.236 A:middle
He is going to give us a
demo of TestFlight and talk



00:18:59.396 --> 00:19:01.236 A:middle
He is going to give us a
demo of TestFlight and talk

00:19:01.236 --> 00:19:02.616 A:middle
about some new features there.

00:19:03.056 --> 00:19:03.346 A:middle
Jason?

00:19:04.516 --> 00:19:08.796 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:09.296 --> 00:19:09.706 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JASON GREGORI: Thanks, Dave.

00:19:10.326 --> 00:19:10.826 A:middle
Hi, everyone.

00:19:10.896 --> 00:19:11.956 A:middle
My name is Jason.

00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:14.286 A:middle
I am going to give you a
quick preview of what's coming

00:19:14.386 --> 00:19:15.776 A:middle
with TestFlight in iOS 9.

00:19:17.126 --> 00:19:20.716 A:middle
Okay. Let's get started
with the new TestFlight tab

00:19:20.716 --> 00:19:21.406 A:middle
in iTunes Connect.

00:19:23.136 --> 00:19:25.526 A:middle
To get there from the My
Apps page, click on your app,

00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:30.366 A:middle
and then click on
the TestFlight tab.

00:19:31.106 --> 00:19:32.516 A:middle
Right away, you can see internal

00:19:32.516 --> 00:19:34.306 A:middle
and external testing
have been broken

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:35.726 A:middle
into their own separate
sections.

00:19:36.596 --> 00:19:39.176 A:middle
Not only does this help with
clarity, it also allows you

00:19:39.176 --> 00:19:41.476 A:middle
to give two completely
different versions of your app

00:19:41.476 --> 00:19:43.286 A:middle
to your internal and
external testers.

00:19:44.226 --> 00:19:46.006 A:middle
Here in the internal
testing section,

00:19:46.036 --> 00:19:48.016 A:middle
you can see the current
build being tested,

00:19:48.506 --> 00:19:51.066 A:middle
your internal testers,
and their current status.

00:19:52.436 --> 00:19:54.786 A:middle
After you've selected the
version of your app you want

00:19:54.786 --> 00:19:59.426 A:middle
to beta test, internal testers
will always get the latest build

00:19:59.426 --> 00:20:02.316 A:middle
sent to them automatically
without beta review.



00:19:59.426 --> 00:20:02.316 A:middle
sent to them automatically
without beta review.

00:20:03.306 --> 00:20:06.676 A:middle
That means once you set internal
testing up, you don't even have

00:20:06.676 --> 00:20:07.876 A:middle
to come to iTunes
Connect at all.

00:20:08.936 --> 00:20:12.146 A:middle
New builds uploaded to iTunes
Connect just automatically go

00:20:12.146 --> 00:20:13.466 A:middle
out to your internal testers.

00:20:16.916 --> 00:20:19.266 A:middle
To change the current version
you want your internal testers

00:20:19.266 --> 00:20:22.096 A:middle
to see, click on the Select
link over on the right.

00:20:22.096 --> 00:20:25.096 A:middle
Here you can choose
which version

00:20:25.096 --> 00:20:27.296 A:middle
of your app internal
testing gets builds from.

00:20:28.336 --> 00:20:29.846 A:middle
Remember that the
version number comes

00:20:29.846 --> 00:20:32.106 A:middle
from your app's CFbundle
short version string,

00:20:32.656 --> 00:20:35.076 A:middle
and the build number comes
from its CFbundle version.

00:20:37.576 --> 00:20:40.076 A:middle
Down below you can
see your testers.

00:20:41.126 --> 00:20:42.916 A:middle
You can see a little
information about them

00:20:42.916 --> 00:20:44.406 A:middle
and whether they've
accepted your invite

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:45.366 A:middle
or installed your app.

00:20:46.466 --> 00:20:49.126 A:middle
You can also add or
edit testers from here.

00:20:50.056 --> 00:20:53.326 A:middle
Let's add another tester.

00:20:54.176 --> 00:20:56.756 A:middle
Everyone eligible for
testing but not yet invited

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:58.736 A:middle
to the app shows up here.

00:20:59.846 --> 00:21:03.156 A:middle
Remember, you only have
up to 25 internal testers,



00:20:59.846 --> 00:21:03.156 A:middle
Remember, you only have
up to 25 internal testers,

00:21:03.506 --> 00:21:05.896 A:middle
and for someone to be
eligible, they must be

00:21:05.896 --> 00:21:07.096 A:middle
on your iTunes Connect team.

00:21:07.986 --> 00:21:11.456 A:middle
Let's add Eric.

00:21:11.886 --> 00:21:15.726 A:middle
After I add and save, Eric
will get an invite sent right

00:21:15.726 --> 00:21:16.306 A:middle
to his inbox.

00:21:21.786 --> 00:21:23.246 A:middle
Over on the external
testing side,

00:21:23.806 --> 00:21:26.586 A:middle
you'll see your currently
testable builds as well

00:21:26.586 --> 00:21:27.576 A:middle
as your external testers.

00:21:28.866 --> 00:21:30.846 A:middle
The great thing about
external testing is

00:21:30.846 --> 00:21:33.696 A:middle
that you get a thousand tester
slots, and to add a tester,

00:21:34.066 --> 00:21:35.166 A:middle
all you need is an
email address.

00:21:37.376 --> 00:21:39.316 A:middle
There are some new changes
to external testing.

00:21:39.896 --> 00:21:42.756 A:middle
One, you can now give your
external testers a completely

00:21:42.756 --> 00:21:45.176 A:middle
different version of your app
than your internal testers.

00:21:45.646 --> 00:21:48.326 A:middle
Which is great for letting
external testers test the latest

00:21:48.326 --> 00:21:50.816 A:middle
minor update while
internal testers are

00:21:50.816 --> 00:21:51.696 A:middle
on the next big release.

00:21:52.466 --> 00:21:55.186 A:middle
And two, you can now
submit a version of your app

00:21:55.186 --> 00:21:58.266 A:middle
to beta review while your
external testers continue

00:21:58.266 --> 00:22:00.046 A:middle
to test a different
version of your app.



00:21:58.266 --> 00:22:00.046 A:middle
to test a different
version of your app.

00:22:01.676 --> 00:22:05.506 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:22:06.006 --> 00:22:09.386 A:middle
Okay. Let's look at adding
a new version to test.

00:22:09.776 --> 00:22:12.056 A:middle
Clicking the Add link brings
me to the build chooser.

00:22:12.886 --> 00:22:14.966 A:middle
Notice I am specifying exactly

00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:18.446 A:middle
which build external
testers will get.

00:22:18.516 --> 00:22:21.026 A:middle
Let's add this build.

00:22:21.326 --> 00:22:24.006 A:middle
We are immediately taken
to a submission page

00:22:24.146 --> 00:22:25.516 A:middle
for this specific build.

00:22:26.436 --> 00:22:30.046 A:middle
Unlike for internal testing,
external testers always get What

00:22:30.046 --> 00:22:32.966 A:middle
to Test information,
an app description,

00:22:33.396 --> 00:22:34.686 A:middle
and a feedback email address.

00:22:35.676 --> 00:22:41.236 A:middle
Next up, export compliance.

00:22:41.936 --> 00:22:43.436 A:middle
Don't you wish you could
just skip this page?

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:45.266 A:middle
Well, now you can.

00:22:45.266 --> 00:22:47.656 A:middle
Dave will show you later
in this presentation.

00:22:48.626 --> 00:22:50.016 A:middle
But for now, I will just
answer the question.

00:22:57.106 --> 00:22:58.626 A:middle
After submitting,
we are taken back

00:22:58.656 --> 00:22:59.816 A:middle
to the external testing page,



00:23:00.306 --> 00:23:02.026 A:middle
and we can see our new
build is in review.

00:23:04.486 --> 00:23:06.716 A:middle
Notice how even though I have
a new build in beta review,

00:23:06.716 --> 00:23:08.466 A:middle
my testers still have access

00:23:08.466 --> 00:23:10.376 A:middle
to the build they were
previously testing.

00:23:10.846 --> 00:23:12.536 A:middle
I can even swap out the build

00:23:12.576 --> 00:23:14.186 A:middle
for one that's already
been approved.

00:23:19.116 --> 00:23:20.266 A:middle
Let's add an external tester.

00:23:20.896 --> 00:23:29.036 A:middle
I'm going to add my friend Ben.

00:23:30.396 --> 00:23:32.206 A:middle
All I need to add Ben
is his email address.

00:23:33.146 --> 00:23:36.036 A:middle
I want to again point out here
that the email address you use

00:23:36.036 --> 00:23:38.706 A:middle
for a tester does not
have to be their Apple ID.

00:23:39.476 --> 00:23:41.166 A:middle
Any email address
they have access

00:23:41.166 --> 00:23:43.656 A:middle
to on their iOS device
is perfectly valid.

00:23:44.686 --> 00:23:47.486 A:middle
Once they accept the invite,
your app will become linked

00:23:47.546 --> 00:23:49.206 A:middle
to their logged-in Apple ID.

00:23:49.766 --> 00:23:51.816 A:middle
What this means for
you is don't worry

00:23:51.816 --> 00:23:53.326 A:middle
about which email
address you use.

00:23:55.386 --> 00:23:59.366 A:middle
Now, I just save,
confirm, and I am done.

00:23:59.626 --> 00:24:01.196 A:middle
The invite is sent.



00:23:59.626 --> 00:24:01.196 A:middle
The invite is sent.

00:24:02.156 --> 00:24:03.556 A:middle
Now, you might be
asking yourself,

00:24:04.126 --> 00:24:05.646 A:middle
where do all the old builds go?

00:24:06.416 --> 00:24:07.736 A:middle
I am glad you asked that.

00:24:08.866 --> 00:24:14.106 A:middle
[Laughter] They go to the
TestFlight build section.

00:24:15.096 --> 00:24:17.656 A:middle
The build section includes
not just the old builds

00:24:17.706 --> 00:24:19.746 A:middle
but every single build
you've added to TestFlight.

00:24:20.696 --> 00:24:23.506 A:middle
You can view each build's
current internal status,

00:24:23.946 --> 00:24:26.646 A:middle
external status, and the number
of times it was installed.

00:24:27.376 --> 00:24:31.476 A:middle
Click on a build, and you can
see even more information,

00:24:32.566 --> 00:24:37.566 A:middle
including who tested it and
detailed technical information.

00:24:39.436 --> 00:24:40.366 A:middle
All right.

00:24:41.126 --> 00:24:43.896 A:middle
Let's move on to
the TestFlight app.

00:24:46.856 --> 00:24:47.886 A:middle
Here's an invite for our app.

00:24:47.886 --> 00:24:52.926 A:middle
Right in the email, I get this
nice, big Start Testing button.

00:24:54.286 --> 00:24:55.946 A:middle
Now, if I don't have
the TestFlight app,

00:24:56.516 --> 00:24:58.016 A:middle
tapping Start Testing
will take me

00:24:58.016 --> 00:24:59.326 A:middle
to the App Store to install it.



00:25:00.016 --> 00:25:02.776 A:middle
Or if I am in a third-party
browser or email client,

00:25:02.806 --> 00:25:05.186 A:middle
I will get options to
install or open TestFlight.

00:25:06.356 --> 00:25:09.936 A:middle
Since I already have
TestFlight installed,

00:25:10.366 --> 00:25:12.296 A:middle
it's going to take me straight
into the TestFlight app,

00:25:12.296 --> 00:25:15.296 A:middle
where I can view and install the
beta, which I will do right now.

00:25:18.256 --> 00:25:21.076 A:middle
Since this beta supports Apple
Watch, I get this Watch bar app

00:25:21.076 --> 00:25:24.976 A:middle
at the top, which lets me
install the WatchKit app right

00:25:24.976 --> 00:25:29.336 A:middle
onto my Watch right
from in TestFlight.

00:25:31.436 --> 00:25:35.606 A:middle
TestFlight will support both
watchOS 1 and watchOS 2 apps

00:25:35.796 --> 00:25:38.766 A:middle
and will install the best app
supported by the user's Watch.

00:25:38.876 --> 00:25:43.776 A:middle
I am happy to report TestFlight
will also auto-install beta

00:25:43.776 --> 00:25:45.786 A:middle
WatchKit apps if
that's your preference.

00:25:48.286 --> 00:25:52.366 A:middle
We are also adding a new
screen for incompatible apps.

00:25:53.036 --> 00:25:55.506 A:middle
When a tester has a device
that doesn't support your app,

00:25:56.016 --> 00:25:57.166 A:middle
they'll now get a new screen,

00:25:57.166 --> 00:25:58.696 A:middle
which helps explain
what's going on.



00:26:01.156 --> 00:26:04.716 A:middle
Here's an iPad app with
instructions on how to get it.

00:26:04.716 --> 00:26:07.346 A:middle
Open TestFlight on your
iPad, much more obvious.

00:26:10.156 --> 00:26:12.506 A:middle
Another change we are making
is adding more control

00:26:12.506 --> 00:26:13.466 A:middle
over notifications.

00:26:13.996 --> 00:26:15.356 A:middle
Down at the bottom of this page,

00:26:15.956 --> 00:26:17.416 A:middle
there's a new Notifications
button.

00:26:17.996 --> 00:26:21.336 A:middle
Some people prefer to
get only email updates,

00:26:21.766 --> 00:26:23.766 A:middle
some prefer to get only
push notifications,

00:26:24.476 --> 00:26:27.376 A:middle
and in the new notifications
menu, you can choose

00:26:27.376 --> 00:26:30.716 A:middle
to turn push notifications
and email notifications on

00:26:30.716 --> 00:26:33.016 A:middle
or off on a per-app basis.

00:26:34.616 --> 00:26:35.896 A:middle
And there you have it.

00:26:36.336 --> 00:26:37.916 A:middle
Back to you, Dave.

00:26:39.476 --> 00:26:47.516 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:26:48.016 --> 00:26:48.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; DAVE VAN TASSELL:
Thank you, Jason.

00:26:49.736 --> 00:26:52.786 A:middle
I want to recap one of the
changes that Jason talked about,

00:26:52.786 --> 00:26:56.126 A:middle
and this is about your
internal and external testers.

00:26:57.016 --> 00:26:59.376 A:middle
The ability to let your
internal testers be working

00:26:59.376 --> 00:27:02.856 A:middle
on one version -- in
this case, version 1.1 --



00:26:59.376 --> 00:27:02.856 A:middle
on one version -- in
this case, version 1.1 --

00:27:03.906 --> 00:27:06.166 A:middle
and your external testers
can then be invited

00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:09.026 A:middle
to a completely separate
version, version 1.0.

00:27:09.616 --> 00:27:13.566 A:middle
Some other changes we
will be rolling out are

00:27:13.566 --> 00:27:15.236 A:middle
about the metrics
for TestFlight.

00:27:15.536 --> 00:27:20.096 A:middle
Today we support installs,
counts across your builds

00:27:20.096 --> 00:27:23.716 A:middle
and versions, and we will be
rolling out the same metrics

00:27:23.866 --> 00:27:28.006 A:middle
for sessions across builds and
versions as well as crashes

00:27:28.696 --> 00:27:30.976 A:middle
at your build and version level.

00:27:31.516 --> 00:27:36.356 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:36.856 --> 00:27:39.286 A:middle
And all three of these metrics
will also be able to show you

00:27:39.286 --> 00:27:41.546 A:middle
at the tester level,
so you can then see

00:27:41.546 --> 00:27:43.256 A:middle
which testers are
having the most success

00:27:43.306 --> 00:27:46.026 A:middle
and which testers are having the
most problems, and you can reach

00:27:46.066 --> 00:27:48.806 A:middle
out to them with that same
email address they gave you

00:27:48.846 --> 00:27:50.066 A:middle
when you invited
them to TestFlight.

00:27:50.596 --> 00:27:54.926 A:middle
In iTunes Connect,
it looks like this.

00:27:55.956 --> 00:28:00.556 A:middle
You can see those numbers for
installs, sessions, and crashes.



00:27:55.956 --> 00:28:00.556 A:middle
You can see those numbers for
installs, sessions, and crashes.

00:28:04.836 --> 00:28:08.456 A:middle
I'd also like to talk about
some new TestFlight limits.

00:28:09.356 --> 00:28:12.726 A:middle
Currently, you can upload two
builds a day, and we are going

00:28:12.726 --> 00:28:14.926 A:middle
to bump that up to six
external builds a day.

00:28:16.476 --> 00:28:19.016 A:middle
We also want to increase the
number of apps you can have

00:28:19.016 --> 00:28:21.636 A:middle
in active TestFlight
from 10 to 100.

00:28:22.476 --> 00:28:26.346 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:26.846 --> 00:28:28.116 A:middle
That one was worth
clapping about [Laughter].

00:28:30.556 --> 00:28:32.096 A:middle
Build expiration,
we are going to bump

00:28:32.096 --> 00:28:33.846 A:middle
that up from 30 to 60 days.

00:28:34.676 --> 00:28:37.296 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:37.796 --> 00:28:42.026 A:middle
Internal testers, 25 unique user
names per account, we are going

00:28:42.026 --> 00:28:44.756 A:middle
to change that to
25 users per app.

00:28:45.046 --> 00:28:49.006 A:middle
And then for internal testing,
we want to go from 1,000

00:28:49.006 --> 00:28:51.176 A:middle
to 2,000 external
testers per app.

00:28:52.016 --> 00:28:55.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:56.066 --> 00:28:58.386 A:middle
Today for TestFlight,
you can TestFlight all

00:28:58.386 --> 00:28:59.426 A:middle
of your iOS 8 apps.



00:29:00.016 --> 00:29:02.466 A:middle
Also with Monday's
C1 release of iOS 9,

00:29:02.506 --> 00:29:05.016 A:middle
you can invite your internal
testers to test those apps,

00:29:05.536 --> 00:29:09.066 A:middle
and we have Apple
Watch support 1.0.

00:29:09.256 --> 00:29:12.136 A:middle
Later this summer, we will be
extending iOS 9 beta testing

00:29:12.136 --> 00:29:14.846 A:middle
to external testers,
as well as watchOS 2,

00:29:14.846 --> 00:29:17.636 A:middle
and we will begin
supporting app thinning

00:29:17.806 --> 00:29:20.656 A:middle
and ODR support natively with
the App Store infrastructure

00:29:21.336 --> 00:29:23.446 A:middle
that you will be using when
your customers get their hands

00:29:23.716 --> 00:29:25.086 A:middle
on these same apps.

00:29:26.616 --> 00:29:28.276 A:middle
Those are our changes
to TestFlight,

00:29:28.346 --> 00:29:32.426 A:middle
but as Jason mentioned, we
have a change around encryption

00:29:32.786 --> 00:29:33.756 A:middle
and export compliance.

00:29:33.756 --> 00:29:35.896 A:middle
We have added a new
tab under Features.

00:29:36.436 --> 00:29:40.766 A:middle
Today, when you submit your
app, whether it's for beta

00:29:40.766 --> 00:29:42.126 A:middle
or for the App Store, we ask,

00:29:42.166 --> 00:29:43.506 A:middle
does your app use
any encryption?

00:29:43.986 --> 00:29:48.236 A:middle
And based on the encryption
that you use, we require upload

00:29:48.236 --> 00:29:49.756 A:middle
of export compliance
documentation.

00:29:50.306 --> 00:29:53.066 A:middle
So we are going to
add a new plist key

00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:57.546 A:middle
in Xcode called ITS app
uses nonexempt encryption.

00:29:58.556 --> 00:30:02.086 A:middle
Enter False in here, and that
will let us know what kind



00:29:58.556 --> 00:30:02.086 A:middle
Enter False in here, and that
will let us know what kind

00:30:02.086 --> 00:30:03.296 A:middle
of encryption that you use.

00:30:03.456 --> 00:30:07.816 A:middle
If your app does use nonstandard
encryption, answer Yes.

00:30:07.816 --> 00:30:10.356 A:middle
And then you can go back
into iTunes Connect,

00:30:11.696 --> 00:30:12.716 A:middle
tell us about the encryption,

00:30:13.696 --> 00:30:16.786 A:middle
upload the correct export
compliance ERN documents,

00:30:16.826 --> 00:30:18.566 A:middle
and we are going
to give you a code.

00:30:19.186 --> 00:30:23.146 A:middle
With that code, you can
enter that into Xcode

00:30:23.146 --> 00:30:27.636 A:middle
with the plist key ITS
encryption export compliance

00:30:27.636 --> 00:30:30.566 A:middle
code, and we will link
the encryption you told us

00:30:30.566 --> 00:30:33.856 A:middle
about in iTunes Connect with the
build that you are uploading,

00:30:33.856 --> 00:30:36.036 A:middle
and you can reuse this code
across many different builds

00:30:36.386 --> 00:30:39.436 A:middle
to let us know the form of
encryption you are using.

00:30:39.956 --> 00:30:42.556 A:middle
If you change your encryption,
log back into iTunes Connect,

00:30:42.556 --> 00:30:45.326 A:middle
let us know about it, upload
the correct documentation,

00:30:45.496 --> 00:30:47.516 A:middle
we will give you another code,
and you can use that code

00:30:47.516 --> 00:30:50.036 A:middle
with the builds that support
this new version of encryption.

00:30:50.586 --> 00:30:54.796 A:middle
And those are our
changes to My Apps.

00:30:54.916 --> 00:30:59.686 A:middle
I want to talk about
users and roles,



00:31:00.566 --> 00:31:03.076 A:middle
and there's three new features
we are going to be introducing.

00:31:03.216 --> 00:31:06.526 A:middle
The first is account switching,
the ability to use one user name

00:31:06.526 --> 00:31:08.176 A:middle
to log into multiple accounts.

00:31:09.476 --> 00:31:12.086 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:12.586 --> 00:31:14.976 A:middle
The second is app siloing,
where you can separate

00:31:14.976 --> 00:31:16.706 A:middle
which apps different
users can see.

00:31:18.016 --> 00:31:20.216 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:20.716 --> 00:31:22.346 A:middle
And the third are some
new users and roles

00:31:22.346 --> 00:31:23.636 A:middle
to help with these features.

00:31:24.146 --> 00:31:26.256 A:middle
Let's start with
account switching.

00:31:27.206 --> 00:31:29.126 A:middle
As you log in, you
have your user name,

00:31:29.126 --> 00:31:31.656 A:middle
you log into your account,
and as you get access to more

00:31:31.656 --> 00:31:34.966 A:middle
and more accounts, you create
new user names for each account.

00:31:36.156 --> 00:31:37.916 A:middle
With account switching,
you'll be able

00:31:37.916 --> 00:31:39.686 A:middle
to use a single user name to log

00:31:39.686 --> 00:31:41.616 A:middle
into all these different
accounts.

00:31:42.836 --> 00:31:45.226 A:middle
But with each account, you have
different apps that you see,

00:31:45.226 --> 00:31:46.236 A:middle
you have different roles.

00:31:46.236 --> 00:31:50.456 A:middle
So we will make it so that as
you log in and you can switch

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:53.516 A:middle
which account that
you want to view,

00:31:54.456 --> 00:31:56.146 A:middle
will change those
apps that you see.

00:31:56.506 --> 00:31:59.076 A:middle
You will get those roles and
permissions that you have

00:31:59.126 --> 00:32:00.946 A:middle
for the account that
you've now moved to.



00:31:59.126 --> 00:32:00.946 A:middle
for the account that
you've now moved to.

00:32:02.156 --> 00:32:02.986 A:middle
And that's account switching.

00:32:03.486 --> 00:32:10.456 A:middle
Every account starts with
one user, your admin user.

00:32:11.476 --> 00:32:16.696 A:middle
As you start adding more and
more apps to this account,

00:32:17.246 --> 00:32:19.456 A:middle
you start adding
more and more users.

00:32:20.866 --> 00:32:22.646 A:middle
Most of these users
are technical users,

00:32:23.386 --> 00:32:26.946 A:middle
but what you found is you want
some users to see some apps

00:32:27.516 --> 00:32:29.086 A:middle
and some users to
see other apps.

00:32:29.086 --> 00:32:32.636 A:middle
So what we are going to do is
we are going to separate this

00:32:33.246 --> 00:32:34.886 A:middle
into three different areas.

00:32:37.256 --> 00:32:39.836 A:middle
We also realize that Technical
User is a little bit broad,

00:32:40.196 --> 00:32:41.726 A:middle
so we are going to
deprecate Technical

00:32:42.066 --> 00:32:44.216 A:middle
with a new role called
App Manager.

00:32:45.066 --> 00:32:47.836 A:middle
This App Manager will be
able to manage these apps

00:32:49.006 --> 00:32:49.946 A:middle
in iTunes Connect for you.

00:32:50.026 --> 00:32:54.046 A:middle
We are going to add two new
roles, Developer and Marketer,

00:32:54.046 --> 00:32:55.406 A:middle
to help out with this.

00:32:55.656 --> 00:32:57.146 A:middle
Let's talk about what
these roles entail.

00:32:57.756 --> 00:33:01.706 A:middle
In App Manager, they will
be able to create users,



00:32:57.756 --> 00:33:01.706 A:middle
In App Manager, they will
be able to create users,

00:33:01.796 --> 00:33:07.546 A:middle
change pricing, invite new
people to these different roles

00:33:07.546 --> 00:33:09.976 A:middle
that we have, as well as
submit apps for review,

00:33:09.976 --> 00:33:14.246 A:middle
both beta and for App Store.

00:33:14.456 --> 00:33:17.106 A:middle
The Developer role will be able
to do developer kinds of things,

00:33:17.346 --> 00:33:19.686 A:middle
upload the binaries,
view the crash logs,

00:33:20.106 --> 00:33:23.266 A:middle
and view the store
metadata in iTunes Connect.

00:33:26.516 --> 00:33:29.106 A:middle
Marketing role will be
able to actually change

00:33:29.216 --> 00:33:32.686 A:middle
that stored metadata in iTunes
Connect, upload promo art,

00:33:32.686 --> 00:33:40.316 A:middle
as well as request promo codes
for the apps on your team.

00:33:40.526 --> 00:33:42.686 A:middle
All three of these
roles will be eligible

00:33:43.116 --> 00:33:47.206 A:middle
for internal TestFlight
users, as well as have access

00:33:47.206 --> 00:33:50.086 A:middle
to create in-app purchases,
leaderboards, achievements,

00:33:50.436 --> 00:33:52.116 A:middle
and view Resolution Center.

00:33:53.796 --> 00:33:55.396 A:middle
And these are the changes
that we are rolling

00:33:55.396 --> 00:33:58.016 A:middle
out for users and roles.

00:33:59.476 --> 00:34:02.746 A:middle
[ Applause ]



00:33:59.476 --> 00:34:02.746 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:34:03.246 --> 00:34:04.436 A:middle
So what's new in iTunes Connect?

00:34:04.866 --> 00:34:08.676 A:middle
We have a new version release
control, a new pricing design,

00:34:09.686 --> 00:34:13.196 A:middle
separate TestFlight versions
for internal and external users,

00:34:13.755 --> 00:34:17.735 A:middle
increased TestFlight limits,
new encryption plist keys,

00:34:18.146 --> 00:34:23.076 A:middle
account switching, app siloing,
and new users and roles.

00:34:23.806 --> 00:34:28.496 A:middle
And all these features will
be coming out later this fall.

00:34:28.496 --> 00:34:32.306 A:middle
Now, each year we like to ask
App Review if they had a chance

00:34:32.306 --> 00:34:35.356 A:middle
to help explain to some
developers, such as yourselves,

00:34:36.866 --> 00:34:39.525 A:middle
what could I impart on you
to help your apps make it

00:34:39.525 --> 00:34:40.275 A:middle
through App Review better?

00:34:41.065 --> 00:34:41.916 A:middle
And they give us a list.

00:34:41.916 --> 00:34:43.446 A:middle
This year they have
gone one step better

00:34:43.446 --> 00:34:46.216 A:middle
and they have a web page
you can look up and see:

00:34:46.216 --> 00:34:47.545 A:middle
What are the common rejections?

00:34:47.846 --> 00:34:49.106 A:middle
What problems are
people are having?

00:34:49.656 --> 00:34:51.446 A:middle
Such as your demo account info.

00:34:52.636 --> 00:34:55.585 A:middle
If your app requires a login to
function, you need to provide

00:34:55.585 --> 00:34:57.966 A:middle
that in iTunes Connect
beforehand.

00:34:58.506 --> 00:35:00.706 A:middle
Or if you have an in-app
purchase that requires services



00:34:58.506 --> 00:35:00.706 A:middle
Or if you have an in-app
purchase that requires services

00:35:00.806 --> 00:35:04.286 A:middle
to be running before the in-app
purchase works, have that ready

00:35:04.366 --> 00:35:06.946 A:middle
at app submission time, not
just when you want your app

00:35:06.946 --> 00:35:07.796 A:middle
to go live in the Store.

00:35:07.876 --> 00:35:10.696 A:middle
This is a really great web page,

00:35:10.696 --> 00:35:11.976 A:middle
and I highly recommend
checking it out.

00:35:13.576 --> 00:35:15.416 A:middle
We also have another web page

00:35:15.416 --> 00:35:18.676 A:middle
about what makes good
information about my app.

00:35:18.986 --> 00:35:20.156 A:middle
What makes a good name?

00:35:20.526 --> 00:35:21.586 A:middle
What is a good description?

00:35:22.186 --> 00:35:26.236 A:middle
This is another great resource
for understanding your metadata

00:35:26.236 --> 00:35:27.246 A:middle
and filling that out well.

00:35:27.936 --> 00:35:30.026 A:middle
And the third page
I want to talk

00:35:30.026 --> 00:35:32.346 A:middle
about is dedicated
just to app previews.

00:35:32.686 --> 00:35:34.876 A:middle
We launched this last
year, and it's a great way

00:35:34.876 --> 00:35:36.996 A:middle
to give your customers
a dynamic feel

00:35:36.996 --> 00:35:40.506 A:middle
for what your app is
before they download it.

00:35:40.596 --> 00:35:42.426 A:middle
You want to know what it
is and how to get started?

00:35:42.646 --> 00:35:43.386 A:middle
Check out this page.

00:35:43.926 --> 00:35:46.746 A:middle
Now, for more information,
of course,

00:35:46.746 --> 00:35:48.806 A:middle
the iTunes Connect Guide
is a great resource.

00:35:49.276 --> 00:35:51.586 A:middle
The dev forums as well.

00:35:51.776 --> 00:35:53.246 A:middle
We have our Evangelist,
Mark Malone.

00:35:53.246 --> 00:35:56.106 A:middle
If you have any questions,
these are all great resources.

00:35:56.186 --> 00:35:58.936 A:middle
I want to call out
some related sessions.

00:35:59.016 --> 00:36:01.156 A:middle
We had one on Tuesday about iAd,



00:35:59.016 --> 00:36:01.156 A:middle
We had one on Tuesday about iAd,

00:36:01.156 --> 00:36:04.416 A:middle
as well as one earlier this
morning all about app thinning.

00:36:05.636 --> 00:36:07.816 A:middle
Later today, Getting the
Most Out of App Analytics

00:36:08.776 --> 00:36:10.346 A:middle
and iTunes Connect: Development

00:36:10.346 --> 00:36:11.926 A:middle
to Distribution will
be this afternoon.

00:36:11.926 --> 00:36:14.296 A:middle
And with that, I want
to wish you a great rest

00:36:14.296 --> 00:36:14.986 A:middle
of your conference.

00:36:15.416 --> 00:36:15.996 A:middle
Have a good day.

00:36:17.476 --> 00:36:29.310 A:middle
