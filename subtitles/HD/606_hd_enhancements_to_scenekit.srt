00:00:24.516 --> 00:00:29.826 A:middle
[Applause]

00:00:30.326 --> 00:00:30.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:33.176 A:middle
So good afternoon, and welcome

00:00:33.176 --> 00:00:35.586 A:middle
to the enhancements
to SceneKit session.

00:00:35.886 --> 00:00:37.896 A:middle
My name is Thomas Goossens.

00:00:37.896 --> 00:00:43.096 A:middle
If you don't already know what
SceneKit is, here is an overview

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:46.156 A:middle
of the different
frameworks on iOS 10.

00:00:46.996 --> 00:00:50.296 A:middle
SceneKit and SpriteKit
are the high-level APIs.

00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.926 A:middle
SpriteKit for 2D
and SceneKit for 3D.

00:00:54.656 --> 00:00:57.986 A:middle
You can use them with other game
technologies like Model I/O,

00:00:58.396 --> 00:01:02.706 A:middle
GameplayKit, and GameController,
and give you access



00:00:58.396 --> 00:01:02.706 A:middle
GameplayKit, and GameController,
and give you access

00:01:02.706 --> 00:01:07.236 A:middle
to the low-level APIs,
which are OpenGL and Metal.

00:01:07.786 --> 00:01:12.476 A:middle
SceneKit was introduced
on OS X on Mountain Lion

00:01:12.886 --> 00:01:15.476 A:middle
and last year on iOS in iOS 8.

00:01:17.216 --> 00:01:21.616 A:middle
Last year, we added a few
new features to SceneKit

00:01:21.836 --> 00:01:25.306 A:middle
to make it ready for casual
games, like particle systems,

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:29.276 A:middle
physics, force fields, and the
integration with SpriteKit,

00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:32.026 A:middle
for example, for all
the 2D game overlays.

00:01:34.036 --> 00:01:36.506 A:middle
This year, the two
main additions

00:01:36.506 --> 00:01:38.786 A:middle
to SceneKit are the
transition to Metal

00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:40.796 A:middle
and the new Scene Editor.

00:01:40.896 --> 00:01:43.866 A:middle
In this presentation
we will start

00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:45.726 A:middle
by showing you the
new Scene Editor,

00:01:46.226 --> 00:01:48.806 A:middle
then explain why we are
transitioning to Metal

00:01:48.806 --> 00:01:51.146 A:middle
and what it means for
you in terms of adoption.

00:01:51.876 --> 00:01:55.236 A:middle
And we will finish by presenting
a few new features that we added

00:01:55.236 --> 00:01:56.456 A:middle
to the engine this year.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:57.326 A:middle
All right.

00:01:57.956 --> 00:02:00.076 A:middle
The new Scene Editor.



00:01:57.956 --> 00:02:00.076 A:middle
The new Scene Editor.

00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:06.696 A:middle
It is available in Xcode 7,
so we can run it in El Capitan

00:02:07.176 --> 00:02:10.916 A:middle
or Yosemite, and it is
available in the force field.

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:18.816 A:middle
To open it, simply open a 3D
file with SceneKit, for example,

00:02:18.816 --> 00:02:26.586 A:middle
DAE, OBJ, olympic, or you can
create using template chooser.

00:02:27.476 --> 00:02:32.186 A:middle
In that case, it will create
a new empty SceneKit document

00:02:32.696 --> 00:02:34.606 A:middle
with the extension .scn,

00:02:35.966 --> 00:02:41.436 A:middle
and an scn file is simply an
scn scene instance archived

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:42.916 A:middle
with an archiver.

00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:46.996 A:middle
That means that you can produce
your own SceneKit document

00:02:47.476 --> 00:02:50.226 A:middle
programmatically if you
want, and this is very handy

00:02:50.226 --> 00:02:51.316 A:middle
for the production flow.

00:02:51.846 --> 00:02:55.676 A:middle
Then the main goal of
the Scene Editor is

00:02:55.726 --> 00:02:57.986 A:middle
to let you build the
levels of your game.

00:02:58.546 --> 00:03:01.956 A:middle
You will see that it's really
easy to combine multiple assets



00:02:58.546 --> 00:03:01.956 A:middle
You will see that it's really
easy to combine multiple assets

00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:04.206 A:middle
from different files
into a single scene

00:03:04.406 --> 00:03:08.216 A:middle
by keeping references
to the original assets.

00:03:09.416 --> 00:03:13.496 A:middle
The Scene Editor also includes
some visual editors for some

00:03:13.496 --> 00:03:16.046 A:middle
of the key features of
SceneKit, for example,

00:03:16.046 --> 00:03:20.336 A:middle
to let you configure particle
systems live in a 3D scene,

00:03:21.356 --> 00:03:25.546 A:middle
configure your physics, inspect
and configure the physics shapes

00:03:25.546 --> 00:03:28.176 A:middle
of your objects, and preview
a simulation for example,

00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:33.156 A:middle
sensing for force fields, and
it includes an action editor

00:03:33.156 --> 00:03:35.166 A:middle
to let you build
action sequences

00:03:35.466 --> 00:03:36.846 A:middle
with a graphic user interface.

00:03:38.236 --> 00:03:40.866 A:middle
Scene Editor also includes
some more advanced features,

00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:42.226 A:middle
for example, if you want

00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:45.726 A:middle
to editor your shared
modifiers live in your scene,

00:03:46.546 --> 00:03:49.296 A:middle
and some baking tools,
for example,

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:52.226 A:middle
to bake ambient occlusion,
and for this please refer

00:03:52.226 --> 00:03:56.906 A:middle
to the Model IO session for
more information about this.

00:03:57.326 --> 00:03:59.866 A:middle
Okay. But nothing better
than a demo to show you this,



00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:03.616 A:middle
so let me bring Amaury on stage
for presentation of Xcode 7.

00:04:03.616 --> 00:04:03.896 A:middle
Thank you.

00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:10.206 A:middle
[Applause]

00:04:10.706 --> 00:04:11.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; AMAURY BALLIET: Hello.

00:04:11.346 --> 00:04:13.656 A:middle
My name is Amaury, and
I am a software engineer

00:04:13.876 --> 00:04:14.736 A:middle
with the SceneKit team.

00:04:15.346 --> 00:04:18.906 A:middle
We dramatically improved the
SceneKit editor in Xcode 7,

00:04:19.505 --> 00:04:22.096 A:middle
and with its new
editing capabilities,

00:04:22.196 --> 00:04:24.566 A:middle
it's now really easy to
build scenes from the ground

00:04:24.566 --> 00:04:28.526 A:middle
up in a visual and
interactive manner.

00:04:28.586 --> 00:04:33.996 A:middle
Later on in the session, I will
show you how we used SceneKit

00:04:33.996 --> 00:04:38.336 A:middle
in editor to build Red
Panda, the puzzle game,

00:04:38.336 --> 00:04:41.516 A:middle
but right now we will start
with something more simple,

00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:45.166 A:middle
a small game of physical
scale, which consists

00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:48.506 A:middle
of building a tower of blocks
that will eventually collapse

00:04:48.666 --> 00:04:54.866 A:middle
as we remove blocks from it.

00:04:55.176 --> 00:04:58.446 A:middle
So what you see here is a
SceneKit Scene Editor showing an

00:04:58.446 --> 00:04:59.006 A:middle
empty scene.



00:05:00.056 --> 00:05:03.536 A:middle
On the right side, you have
the usually utility area,

00:05:03.716 --> 00:05:06.116 A:middle
with its inspectors
and libraries.

00:05:07.196 --> 00:05:10.106 A:middle
In the object library, you can
find many SceneKit objects,

00:05:10.666 --> 00:05:17.666 A:middle
such as modes, lights,
cameras, parametric geometries,

00:05:18.176 --> 00:05:19.936 A:middle
as well as physics fields.

00:05:20.406 --> 00:05:24.856 A:middle
Now, for our wooden block, we
use a simple box geometric.

00:05:26.776 --> 00:05:32.376 A:middle
To customize its appearance,
I can drop and imagine it.

00:05:33.906 --> 00:05:36.456 A:middle
Okay. So now just like
in Interface Builder,

00:05:36.956 --> 00:05:39.656 A:middle
inspectors as well can
edit all the properties

00:05:39.656 --> 00:05:40.646 A:middle
of your 3D objects.

00:05:41.386 --> 00:05:45.136 A:middle
For instance, in the attributes
inspector, I can change the size

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:49.746 A:middle
of my geometry to
be 2 by 1 by 6.

00:05:50.316 --> 00:05:54.916 A:middle
And to center it in the scene,
I can use the node inspector

00:05:55.896 --> 00:05:58.426 A:middle
and set its position to zero.

00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:01.706 A:middle
But actually, there is a
more simple way to do that.



00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:01.706 A:middle
But actually, there is a
more simple way to do that.

00:06:03.106 --> 00:06:04.626 A:middle
Using the 3D manipulator,

00:06:04.816 --> 00:06:08.996 A:middle
I can freely move the
object in the scene.

00:06:09.226 --> 00:06:11.966 A:middle
Okay. So now that our wooden
block is ready, we will use it

00:06:11.966 --> 00:06:14.406 A:middle
as a template to
build other blocks.

00:06:15.696 --> 00:06:19.196 A:middle
Using the 3D manipulator,
I can easily make copies

00:06:19.516 --> 00:06:21.146 A:middle
by holding the alt key.

00:06:22.456 --> 00:06:29.746 A:middle
I can repeat the
operation, make a selection,

00:06:30.236 --> 00:06:36.046 A:middle
duplicate that selection,
rotate it, make a new selection,

00:06:37.116 --> 00:06:43.446 A:middle
repeat the operation, and one
last time to finish the tower.

00:06:43.656 --> 00:06:47.996 A:middle
Okay. We are now ready to use
the physics engine that's built

00:06:47.996 --> 00:06:50.516 A:middle
into SceneKit to make the
scene more interesting.

00:06:51.586 --> 00:06:53.386 A:middle
I will simply select
all the objects,

00:06:54.336 --> 00:06:56.666 A:middle
head to the physics inspector,

00:06:57.736 --> 00:07:00.546 A:middle
and add a dynamic
body to each block.



00:06:57.736 --> 00:07:00.546 A:middle
and add a dynamic
body to each block.

00:07:01.916 --> 00:07:04.646 A:middle
We are now ready to
run the simulation.

00:07:05.606 --> 00:07:08.526 A:middle
As you can see, our blocks
are now subject to gravity

00:07:08.606 --> 00:07:09.846 A:middle
and fall indefinitely.

00:07:10.766 --> 00:07:13.596 A:middle
To prevent that, we will
add a floor to the scene,

00:07:14.746 --> 00:07:20.606 A:middle
so I open the objects library,
put a floor, position it,

00:07:22.066 --> 00:07:24.986 A:middle
and I need a static body
so that it participates

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:29.336 A:middle
in the simulation but
is not allowed to move.

00:07:29.336 --> 00:07:31.756 A:middle
If we run the simulation
again, nothing happens.

00:07:32.696 --> 00:07:39.776 A:middle
But as we remove a few
blocks from the tower,

00:07:39.996 --> 00:07:43.666 A:middle
we get a fair idea of what
the game could look like.

00:07:44.516 --> 00:07:49.366 A:middle
[Applause]

00:07:49.866 --> 00:07:50.926 A:middle
One additional thing I would

00:07:50.926 --> 00:07:52.726 A:middle
like to show you
is a scene review.

00:07:53.196 --> 00:07:54.516 A:middle
You can review the scene review

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:56.276 A:middle
in the lower left
corner of the editor.

00:07:57.696 --> 00:08:00.416 A:middle
The scene review is where
you can see all the nodes



00:07:57.696 --> 00:08:00.416 A:middle
The scene review is where
you can see all the nodes

00:08:00.416 --> 00:08:04.256 A:middle
in your scene, and it is where
you can edit the node hierarchy.

00:08:05.116 --> 00:08:09.056 A:middle
For instance, we have our
floor, the many wooden boxes,

00:08:09.506 --> 00:08:12.116 A:middle
but we also have a spotlight.

00:08:12.116 --> 00:08:14.556 A:middle
I placed this light
in the scene right

00:08:14.556 --> 00:08:16.316 A:middle
after I created the project.

00:08:17.056 --> 00:08:21.146 A:middle
It is currently hidden and has
no effect, so let's show it.

00:08:22.036 --> 00:08:23.776 A:middle
To further improve the lighting,

00:08:24.296 --> 00:08:26.276 A:middle
and to avoid these
completely dark areas,

00:08:26.796 --> 00:08:29.476 A:middle
I will simply add an
ambient light to the scene.

00:08:30.006 --> 00:08:32.946 A:middle
And that's it.

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.076 A:middle
Just through the editor,
we built an entire scene

00:08:36.155 --> 00:08:40.836 A:middle
with 3D objects, textures,
lighting, and dynamic bodies

00:08:41.236 --> 00:08:43.846 A:middle
that could make a nice game
after we implement gestures.

00:08:43.846 --> 00:08:49.476 A:middle
So the SceneKit Scene Editor
really allows you to build more

00:08:49.476 --> 00:08:53.316 A:middle
of your game up by
writing less code.

00:08:53.886 --> 00:08:56.206 A:middle
And there's actually much
more things that you can do

00:08:56.206 --> 00:08:59.556 A:middle
with Editor, and to
cover that, let's switch

00:08:59.556 --> 00:09:06.146 A:middle
to the Red Panda demo, and
let's see the demo again.



00:08:59.556 --> 00:09:06.146 A:middle
to the Red Panda demo, and
let's see the demo again.

00:09:06.256 --> 00:09:09.266 A:middle
So Red Panda is a puzzle
game in the 3D world,

00:09:09.586 --> 00:09:12.896 A:middle
where you can manipulate
the camera with pan gestures

00:09:12.896 --> 00:09:17.156 A:middle
and control the character
on his path.

00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:23.206 A:middle
The goal of this game is
to collect these flowers

00:09:23.706 --> 00:09:25.776 A:middle
and here is the first one.

00:09:25.776 --> 00:09:32.886 A:middle
On his path, Red Panda will
also have to collect items.

00:09:32.886 --> 00:09:35.366 A:middle
See how the world is rich and
animated with many details?

00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:39.386 A:middle
We have lots of particle
systems and animated vegetation.

00:09:39.876 --> 00:09:44.326 A:middle
Now, Red Panda can go
everywhere in the level.

00:09:44.476 --> 00:09:47.126 A:middle
For instance, he
can climb hills.

00:09:47.126 --> 00:09:54.286 A:middle
But on his path Red Panda will
also have to avoid obstacles.

00:09:54.286 --> 00:09:58.276 A:middle
Notice the sound became
louder as we pushed.

00:09:58.276 --> 00:10:02.666 A:middle
It's because we used one of
SceneKit new API's 3D audio.



00:09:58.276 --> 00:10:02.666 A:middle
It's because we used one of
SceneKit new API's 3D audio.

00:10:02.666 --> 00:10:06.646 A:middle
Many of the features
are in play here.

00:10:06.646 --> 00:10:08.846 A:middle
We have the physics
engine for navigation

00:10:08.846 --> 00:10:09.946 A:middle
and collision detection.

00:10:10.266 --> 00:10:12.496 A:middle
Lots of particle systems.

00:10:12.496 --> 00:10:15.716 A:middle
And shadow modifiers and actions
help to bring the scene to life.

00:10:15.716 --> 00:10:18.726 A:middle
So we just collected
our seventh flower,

00:10:18.726 --> 00:10:23.816 A:middle
and by moving the camera, we
can see where objects hide.

00:10:23.816 --> 00:10:26.126 A:middle
We have a quick tour
under the arch,

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:30.976 A:middle
and the level is completed.

00:10:31.516 --> 00:10:35.306 A:middle
[Music]

00:10:35.806 --> 00:10:36.486 A:middle
Thank you, Thomas.

00:10:37.516 --> 00:10:42.906 A:middle
[Applause]

00:10:43.406 --> 00:10:46.456 A:middle
So we are now going to see how
we built this game using the

00:10:46.456 --> 00:10:47.686 A:middle
SceneKit Scene Editor.

00:10:53.696 --> 00:10:57.406 A:middle
So this is a starting
point for our game.

00:10:57.406 --> 00:10:58.486 A:middle
A quick and easy way

00:10:58.626 --> 00:11:02.396 A:middle
to immediately improve your
scene is to add a skybox.



00:10:58.626 --> 00:11:02.396 A:middle
to immediately improve your
scene is to add a skybox.

00:11:03.046 --> 00:11:09.096 A:middle
A skybox is simply a
collection of six images

00:11:09.286 --> 00:11:11.076 A:middle
that represent the environment.

00:11:12.096 --> 00:11:15.486 A:middle
After we add a skybox to
the scene, we have a context

00:11:15.486 --> 00:11:17.066 A:middle
in which we can build the level.

00:11:17.806 --> 00:11:22.276 A:middle
So if we now take a look at
the resources in our project,

00:11:22.876 --> 00:11:25.146 A:middle
we can see that our
artist provided us

00:11:25.186 --> 00:11:27.636 A:middle
with many building
blocks, and by that I mean

00:11:27.636 --> 00:11:34.326 A:middle
that we have separate files for
the bamboos, for the flowers

00:11:35.096 --> 00:11:38.306 A:middle
to collect, for the
pearls to collect,

00:11:38.306 --> 00:11:40.156 A:middle
as well as the many
structural elements.

00:11:41.426 --> 00:11:45.506 A:middle
So now how do you use these
external building blocks

00:11:45.506 --> 00:11:46.106 A:middle
in your scene?

00:11:46.546 --> 00:11:49.976 A:middle
Well, you go to the
scene, and if you drag

00:11:49.976 --> 00:11:52.646 A:middle
and drop an external
building block in the scene,

00:11:53.226 --> 00:11:55.556 A:middle
you can see that the
reference node has been created

00:11:55.736 --> 00:11:57.966 A:middle
as indicated by this
little arrow icon.

00:11:59.056 --> 00:12:02.976 A:middle
It is very nice and convenient
to have these external resources



00:11:59.056 --> 00:12:02.976 A:middle
It is very nice and convenient
to have these external resources

00:12:02.976 --> 00:12:06.886 A:middle
as external files because that
way you can design the level

00:12:07.096 --> 00:12:09.926 A:middle
and still have a chance
to save the assets,

00:12:10.386 --> 00:12:12.396 A:middle
and you can also
reuse these assets

00:12:12.566 --> 00:12:15.066 A:middle
to build other levels
for your game.

00:12:15.916 --> 00:12:22.526 A:middle
So as you can see, I've already
included other reference nodes

00:12:23.456 --> 00:12:26.066 A:middle
for other industrial elements.

00:12:26.066 --> 00:12:30.706 A:middle
So this is how you
typically build a level.

00:12:31.146 --> 00:12:33.686 A:middle
You would add your
building blocks one

00:12:34.046 --> 00:12:36.656 A:middle
after the other and iterate.

00:12:36.656 --> 00:12:43.246 A:middle
You would do the same thing
for the flowers to collect.

00:12:43.376 --> 00:12:43.986 A:middle
The pearls.

00:12:43.986 --> 00:12:46.546 A:middle
And finally, the vegetation.

00:12:47.186 --> 00:12:51.836 A:middle
So here you can see
how far we went

00:12:52.426 --> 00:12:54.036 A:middle
with just a simple operation.

00:12:55.616 --> 00:12:58.196 A:middle
So as you remember,
our scene is rich

00:12:58.196 --> 00:12:59.856 A:middle
and animated with many details.



00:13:00.096 --> 00:13:01.646 A:middle
We have a lot of
particle systems,

00:13:02.846 --> 00:13:05.206 A:middle
but we also have
animated vegetation.

00:13:05.876 --> 00:13:09.086 A:middle
Many were animated with skimming

00:13:09.346 --> 00:13:12.236 A:middle
which is a fairly Complicated
animation technique that has

00:13:12.236 --> 00:13:14.806 A:middle
to be done in a special tool.

00:13:15.316 --> 00:13:17.956 A:middle
But for we use shadow modifiers.

00:13:18.946 --> 00:13:22.856 A:middle
Actually, there is one last
element to animate here

00:13:23.566 --> 00:13:24.726 A:middle
in the small waterfall.

00:13:25.326 --> 00:13:31.316 A:middle
So to do that, I will open
the scene for our waterfall,

00:13:31.776 --> 00:13:33.956 A:middle
and the SceneKit's
editor now allows you

00:13:34.536 --> 00:13:38.676 A:middle
to add modifiers right into this
scene for immediate feedback

00:13:39.466 --> 00:13:40.866 A:middle
and live compilation issues.

00:13:42.456 --> 00:13:44.726 A:middle
You can add and edit
each of the modifiers

00:13:45.006 --> 00:13:46.306 A:middle
in the assistant editor.

00:13:47.616 --> 00:13:50.926 A:middle
So here I select the
waterfall and choose

00:13:50.926 --> 00:13:52.406 A:middle
to add a geometry modifier.

00:13:52.596 --> 00:13:59.426 A:middle
I add the modifier, and you
can immediately see its effect.



00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:03.056 A:middle
You can play with your
shadow modifier and try

00:14:03.056 --> 00:14:05.396 A:middle
to tweak the final rendering.

00:14:05.666 --> 00:14:09.246 A:middle
You can try to find what
the final modifiers are.

00:14:10.706 --> 00:14:12.116 A:middle
Once you are happy
with your scene,

00:14:13.456 --> 00:14:17.286 A:middle
you close the assistant editor
and go back to your main level.

00:14:17.916 --> 00:14:22.636 A:middle
As you can see, our
mountain is now animated.

00:14:23.336 --> 00:14:26.826 A:middle
This is because we
used reference nodes,

00:14:27.226 --> 00:14:29.586 A:middle
and when you edit assets,

00:14:29.886 --> 00:14:32.166 A:middle
they are automatically
reflected in the scene.

00:14:33.316 --> 00:14:36.086 A:middle
One last thing we
want to do here is

00:14:36.086 --> 00:14:37.526 A:middle
to add an enemy in the scene.

00:14:39.566 --> 00:14:41.476 A:middle
So this is a scene
for our enemy.

00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:44.426 A:middle
As you can see, it is static.

00:14:44.736 --> 00:14:45.606 A:middle
It has no behavior.

00:14:45.606 --> 00:14:49.846 A:middle
To add the behavior,
we will use actions.

00:14:50.686 --> 00:14:52.916 A:middle
The Scene Editor now
allows you to add

00:14:53.446 --> 00:14:55.386 A:middle
and edit actions
right in the scene.

00:14:56.736 --> 00:14:58.486 A:middle
So this is the action editor.

00:14:59.256 --> 00:15:00.446 A:middle
I will select my enemy.



00:14:59.256 --> 00:15:00.446 A:middle
I will select my enemy.

00:15:00.446 --> 00:15:03.656 A:middle
Choose a row detection.

00:15:04.316 --> 00:15:11.176 A:middle
Add it. Set it to
rotate along the Y axis.

00:15:12.636 --> 00:15:14.646 A:middle
And make it repeat forever.

00:15:15.286 --> 00:15:20.496 A:middle
So this is a simple behavior
that we have for our enemy,

00:15:21.326 --> 00:15:25.176 A:middle
but the action editor allows you
to build some complex scenarios,

00:15:25.416 --> 00:15:27.686 A:middle
and for more information
about that, I invite you

00:15:27.686 --> 00:15:29.566 A:middle
to watch the What's New
in SpriteKit session.

00:15:30.976 --> 00:15:36.746 A:middle
We can now go back to our level,
add a reference to our enemy,

00:15:38.176 --> 00:15:39.816 A:middle
and our scene is finished.

00:15:40.366 --> 00:15:44.216 A:middle
So just -- we just saw
how the editor allows you

00:15:44.216 --> 00:15:47.526 A:middle
to build an entire level
from external building blocks

00:15:47.886 --> 00:15:49.756 A:middle
and how you can bring
life to the scene

00:15:49.756 --> 00:15:51.586 A:middle
with shadow modifiers
and actions.

00:15:52.216 --> 00:15:55.206 A:middle
And with that, I hand over
to Thomas, who will talk

00:15:55.206 --> 00:15:57.346 A:middle
about the architecture
of the game.

00:15:58.201 --> 00:16:00.201 A:middle
[Applause]



00:15:58.201 --> 00:16:00.201 A:middle
[Applause]

00:16:00.386 --> 00:16:01.606 A:middle
&gt;&gt; THOMAS GOOSSENS: So
yeah, we are very happy

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:04.786 A:middle
to give you this nice
demo as a sample code.

00:16:05.546 --> 00:16:07.076 A:middle
It's available on the
developer website.

00:16:07.076 --> 00:16:11.016 A:middle
You will see it's very
simple and straightforward.

00:16:11.146 --> 00:16:14.606 A:middle
It's about 1,000 items of
code for both iOS and OS X,

00:16:14.716 --> 00:16:17.916 A:middle
it includes everything like
the sound, the controls,

00:16:18.176 --> 00:16:21.386 A:middle
everything you just saw.

00:16:21.636 --> 00:16:24.556 A:middle
So Amaury showed
you what was done

00:16:24.556 --> 00:16:26.376 A:middle
in Xcode 7 to build this demo.

00:16:26.416 --> 00:16:29.586 A:middle
I will quickly present
the rest, what was done

00:16:29.586 --> 00:16:32.476 A:middle
on the inside and the outside.

00:16:33.246 --> 00:16:37.186 A:middle
The first thing we did
was to define a direction

00:16:37.846 --> 00:16:40.076 A:middle
and a simple game
play for our game.

00:16:40.076 --> 00:16:42.086 A:middle
So we started with
our main character.

00:16:42.606 --> 00:16:44.706 A:middle
Then we defined the
shape of our level,

00:16:44.936 --> 00:16:47.336 A:middle
including where the
collectible items should be

00:16:47.616 --> 00:16:48.786 A:middle
and where the enemy should be.

00:16:49.766 --> 00:16:53.046 A:middle
And we defined the final
appearance we wanted

00:16:53.046 --> 00:16:54.416 A:middle
to achieve using SceneKit.

00:16:55.716 --> 00:17:00.836 A:middle
Then the next step was to scope
the 3D models in the 3D tool,



00:16:55.716 --> 00:17:00.836 A:middle
Then the next step was to scope
the 3D models in the 3D tool,

00:17:02.086 --> 00:17:05.596 A:middle
to paint the different
textures, configure,

00:17:05.596 --> 00:17:07.816 A:middle
and animate our character.

00:17:08.786 --> 00:17:12.616 A:middle
And the final polish was done
by adding some particles,

00:17:12.886 --> 00:17:16.185 A:middle
vegetation, and fog,
and we finished the game

00:17:16.185 --> 00:17:20.766 A:middle
by adding some 2D
overlays on top of that.

00:17:20.766 --> 00:17:23.506 A:middle
Then the first challenge
on the code side was

00:17:23.506 --> 00:17:24.856 A:middle
to manage the collisions.

00:17:25.356 --> 00:17:28.076 A:middle
For example, we don't want our
character to cross the walls.

00:17:28.966 --> 00:17:32.246 A:middle
To do this with collisions,
we work with collision meshes.

00:17:32.246 --> 00:17:37.056 A:middle
A collision mesh is a simplified
version of a rounded mesh

00:17:37.616 --> 00:17:41.146 A:middle
that has a similar shape so that
the collision feels consistent

00:17:41.146 --> 00:17:42.136 A:middle
with what you see on the screen.

00:17:43.366 --> 00:17:45.756 A:middle
It's very important to
work with collision meshes

00:17:45.806 --> 00:17:49.206 A:middle
and not the rendered mesh
when you deal with physics

00:17:49.206 --> 00:17:51.156 A:middle
and collisions for
performance reasons.

00:17:51.206 --> 00:17:56.726 A:middle
And as for the ground, we
want our character to be able

00:17:56.726 --> 00:17:58.946 A:middle
to progress everywhere
in the level

00:17:59.286 --> 00:18:00.706 A:middle
but always stick on the ground.



00:17:59.286 --> 00:18:00.706 A:middle
but always stick on the ground.

00:18:01.326 --> 00:18:03.696 A:middle
So we need to know
what is the elevation

00:18:03.696 --> 00:18:05.366 A:middle
at any point in the 3D world.

00:18:06.616 --> 00:18:08.396 A:middle
For that, there are
several solutions.

00:18:08.666 --> 00:18:12.036 A:middle
What we did here was to again
work with the collision meshes.

00:18:13.676 --> 00:18:18.956 A:middle
And we do array intersection,
vertical array and meshes,

00:18:19.696 --> 00:18:21.446 A:middle
this I was go us an
intersection point,

00:18:22.136 --> 00:18:23.796 A:middle
and this is where we
can place our character.

00:18:24.816 --> 00:18:27.756 A:middle
Then whe we move the
character with the touchscreen

00:18:27.906 --> 00:18:32.186 A:middle
of the keyboard, we simply
move it on the X and Z plane.

00:18:33.376 --> 00:18:36.656 A:middle
Then we do a new intersection
where the character is.

00:18:37.896 --> 00:18:40.726 A:middle
This gives us a new intersection
point, and we use that point

00:18:40.726 --> 00:18:43.426 A:middle
to adjust the Y position
of our character.

00:18:44.296 --> 00:18:48.086 A:middle
We redo that at every frame,
and this is how simple it is

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:51.946 A:middle
to animate our character
in the game.

00:18:52.816 --> 00:18:53.686 A:middle
Then animations.

00:18:54.276 --> 00:18:56.236 A:middle
There are several animated
elements in the game.

00:18:56.936 --> 00:19:01.186 A:middle
The character is animated
when it is idle or working.



00:18:56.936 --> 00:19:01.186 A:middle
The character is animated
when it is idle or working.

00:19:02.506 --> 00:19:04.596 A:middle
The grass and the
bamboos are animated

00:19:04.596 --> 00:19:06.336 A:middle
to simulate wind effect.

00:19:07.026 --> 00:19:09.696 A:middle
And as a nice side effect, you
can see that the shadows casted

00:19:09.696 --> 00:19:12.956 A:middle
by the bamboos are also
automatically animated.

00:19:13.596 --> 00:19:15.546 A:middle
And all these animations
are important

00:19:16.066 --> 00:19:18.936 A:middle
because they contribute
making your game more live.

00:19:20.346 --> 00:19:23.626 A:middle
And technically, the character

00:19:23.626 --> 00:19:26.036 A:middle
and the bamboos are
animated using skinning.

00:19:26.186 --> 00:19:30.456 A:middle
So the artist already built
the skeleton and the animations

00:19:30.616 --> 00:19:33.736 A:middle
in the 3D tool and
exported that to a DAE file,

00:19:34.236 --> 00:19:37.206 A:middle
so they are absolutely no good
to do here for the developer.

00:19:37.786 --> 00:19:40.896 A:middle
And the grass was animated

00:19:41.086 --> 00:19:45.736 A:middle
with a shadow modifier
directly in Xcode 7.

00:19:45.856 --> 00:19:48.276 A:middle
Related to animations,
particle effects.

00:19:49.956 --> 00:19:52.636 A:middle
So there are several particle
effects in the game, and again,

00:19:52.636 --> 00:19:57.886 A:middle
they were all done entirely
in Xcode 7, no code here.

00:19:57.886 --> 00:20:03.656 A:middle
The pearl and the flower
with some sparkles emitted.



00:19:57.886 --> 00:20:03.656 A:middle
The pearl and the flower
with some sparkles emitted.

00:20:04.116 --> 00:20:07.226 A:middle
And the enemy throws some fire.

00:20:07.386 --> 00:20:14.296 A:middle
That was done with a --
modulated with a color gradient.

00:20:14.436 --> 00:20:18.726 A:middle
The particle was done with
four images of dots more

00:20:18.856 --> 00:20:22.986 A:middle
or less blurred with random
sizes and an initial velocity

00:20:22.986 --> 00:20:26.426 A:middle
to simulate the wind effect.

00:20:26.556 --> 00:20:28.226 A:middle
Now, one note about
our materials

00:20:29.086 --> 00:20:31.286 A:middle
and how we achieve this
great-looking materials

00:20:31.286 --> 00:20:32.976 A:middle
in the game.

00:20:33.196 --> 00:20:36.686 A:middle
So here is our looks
like in the game,

00:20:37.046 --> 00:20:39.306 A:middle
but if you just take its
geometry and render it

00:20:39.306 --> 00:20:41.396 A:middle
with flat colors, it
would look like this,

00:20:41.816 --> 00:20:43.416 A:middle
which is a little
bit too simplistic.

00:20:44.146 --> 00:20:47.606 A:middle
So the first thing we did was
to set a diffused texture,

00:20:48.086 --> 00:20:50.386 A:middle
and this gives us a base
color of our objects.

00:20:51.156 --> 00:20:55.806 A:middle
Then we added a normal map
that added very fine details

00:20:56.036 --> 00:20:58.706 A:middle
to our surface without
adding many polygons.

00:20:58.776 --> 00:21:00.266 A:middle
So this is quite cheap.



00:20:58.776 --> 00:21:00.266 A:middle
So this is quite cheap.

00:21:00.976 --> 00:21:06.626 A:middle
Then we added a light map using
the self-illumination property,

00:21:07.066 --> 00:21:08.536 A:middle
which is new in this release.

00:21:09.976 --> 00:21:11.966 A:middle
And the light map
adds very fine details

00:21:11.966 --> 00:21:14.566 A:middle
about global illumination
to our objects.

00:21:14.566 --> 00:21:17.306 A:middle
You can see in the
corner of the stone,

00:21:17.856 --> 00:21:20.896 A:middle
you can see some
occlusion, for example,

00:21:20.896 --> 00:21:24.726 A:middle
that is baked in the light map.

00:21:24.946 --> 00:21:27.946 A:middle
Then the last thing we did
was a reflective cube map

00:21:28.376 --> 00:21:31.126 A:middle
to reflect an environment
and, in particular, the sky.

00:21:31.126 --> 00:21:35.276 A:middle
So the reflective cube
map looks like this.

00:21:35.276 --> 00:21:38.306 A:middle
We attenuate its effect
using an attenuateer

00:21:39.166 --> 00:21:42.846 A:middle
to attenuate the
reflection on the surfaces

00:21:42.956 --> 00:21:46.476 A:middle
that are facing the
point of view.

00:21:46.686 --> 00:21:50.256 A:middle
Now, one note about
the light map.

00:21:50.256 --> 00:21:52.746 A:middle
It only baked the
global illumination

00:21:52.746 --> 00:21:56.446 A:middle
and not the main direct light
and not the main shadows

00:21:57.066 --> 00:21:59.066 A:middle
because we want the
main lighting

00:21:59.066 --> 00:22:00.776 A:middle
to continue to be fully dynamic.



00:21:59.066 --> 00:22:00.776 A:middle
to continue to be fully dynamic.

00:22:01.416 --> 00:22:04.326 A:middle
That way if we want, we can
animate the position of the sun

00:22:04.326 --> 00:22:07.996 A:middle
if needed, but most of all,
a character can progress

00:22:07.996 --> 00:22:11.076 A:middle
in the game, and its shadows
are live and automatically,

00:22:11.076 --> 00:22:14.226 A:middle
you have nothing to do here.

00:22:14.446 --> 00:22:16.076 A:middle
So that's about it
for this demo,

00:22:16.076 --> 00:22:17.936 A:middle
and I hand over to
Sebastien to talk

00:22:17.936 --> 00:22:19.396 A:middle
about the transition to Metal.

00:22:19.746 --> 00:22:19.976 A:middle
Thank you.

00:22:20.516 --> 00:22:24.596 A:middle
[Applause]

00:22:25.096 --> 00:22:27.276 A:middle
&gt;&gt; SEBASTIEN METROT:
Thank you, Thomas.

00:22:27.276 --> 00:22:30.556 A:middle
So I am Sebastien, and I
am working on SceneKit,

00:22:30.946 --> 00:22:34.316 A:middle
and I am going to talk to you
about the transition to Metal

00:22:34.316 --> 00:22:37.096 A:middle
as well as a bunch
of new features

00:22:37.096 --> 00:22:38.366 A:middle
that we have added this year.

00:22:39.946 --> 00:22:43.136 A:middle
So SceneKit is transitioning
to Metal.

00:22:43.136 --> 00:22:45.036 A:middle
Metal, as you know,
is very low-level

00:22:45.226 --> 00:22:50.476 A:middle
and low-overhead graphic API
that brings better performances

00:22:50.636 --> 00:22:54.646 A:middle
and in much more modern
API to the platforms,

00:22:55.406 --> 00:22:58.266 A:middle
and most importantly for you
SceneKit users, it just works.



00:23:00.216 --> 00:23:02.486 A:middle
It also brings some new
features to SceneKit,

00:23:03.206 --> 00:23:06.516 A:middle
like compute shaders so
you can just use a Metal --

00:23:06.516 --> 00:23:13.086 A:middle
or the geometry source or Metal
texture as material property.

00:23:14.046 --> 00:23:16.836 A:middle
It also allows us to
do automatic batching.

00:23:17.216 --> 00:23:19.876 A:middle
So if you have the geometry used

00:23:19.876 --> 00:23:22.306 A:middle
by multiple objects
using the same material,

00:23:22.566 --> 00:23:25.666 A:middle
we can dramatically reduce
the number of [Inaudible].

00:23:26.446 --> 00:23:28.226 A:middle
I will show you that
with a demo.

00:23:29.326 --> 00:23:32.266 A:middle
So what you see is a simple
SceneKit application running

00:23:32.266 --> 00:23:33.976 A:middle
on the OpenGL ES editor.

00:23:34.346 --> 00:23:37.666 A:middle
It is displaying a planet
with orbiting asteroids,

00:23:38.266 --> 00:23:41.176 A:middle
and on the OpenGL
is eating up much

00:23:41.176 --> 00:23:43.076 A:middle
of the CPU just displaying
the asteroids.

00:23:43.116 --> 00:23:46.986 A:middle
As you can see, we cannot
add many more asteroids

00:23:47.106 --> 00:23:49.866 A:middle
without maxing CPU and
reducing the frame rate.

00:23:51.066 --> 00:23:54.136 A:middle
But if we move to the
same application running

00:23:55.306 --> 00:23:58.486 A:middle
on the Metal renderer, we
can add many more asteroids,

00:23:58.916 --> 00:24:02.586 A:middle
as you will see in a moment.



00:23:58.916 --> 00:24:02.586 A:middle
as you will see in a moment.

00:24:02.716 --> 00:24:06.326 A:middle
Yes. Of course, the CPU
starts to be eaten too,

00:24:06.666 --> 00:24:10.686 A:middle
but we can raise the number
of asteroids dramatically.

00:24:11.336 --> 00:24:14.566 A:middle
I think it's quite awesome.

00:24:15.366 --> 00:24:17.366 A:middle
[Applause]

00:24:17.716 --> 00:24:17.976 A:middle
Thank you.

00:24:24.536 --> 00:24:29.196 A:middle
So how do you adopt Metal with
your SceneKit applications?

00:24:30.416 --> 00:24:33.356 A:middle
Well, first is the default
on iOS 9, so you just have

00:24:33.356 --> 00:24:35.726 A:middle
to recompile your
application with the new SDK,

00:24:36.096 --> 00:24:39.156 A:middle
and it will use Metal on all
the hardware that supports it.

00:24:40.316 --> 00:24:41.626 A:middle
It's also backward compatible,

00:24:41.626 --> 00:24:43.476 A:middle
so if you have an
existing application

00:24:43.476 --> 00:24:46.146 A:middle
that you didn't change
and didn't recompile,

00:24:46.146 --> 00:24:48.496 A:middle
it will work on OpenGL
by default.

00:24:49.686 --> 00:24:53.536 A:middle
And you can opt for using the
OpenGL renderer, if you want to,

00:24:53.896 --> 00:24:55.946 A:middle
for example, if you
have custom shaders

00:24:55.986 --> 00:24:57.746 A:middle
that are OpenGL specific.

00:24:58.896 --> 00:25:02.106 A:middle
Choosing the renderer
is really easy,



00:24:58.896 --> 00:25:02.106 A:middle
Choosing the renderer
is really easy,

00:25:02.106 --> 00:25:03.816 A:middle
if you have a built-in
application

00:25:03.816 --> 00:25:08.966 A:middle
with built-in renderer, you just
have to use this small button

00:25:08.966 --> 00:25:10.016 A:middle
to change the default.

00:25:11.186 --> 00:25:12.916 A:middle
You can also do it
programmatically.

00:25:12.916 --> 00:25:16.916 A:middle
So if you created your
scene view at runtime,

00:25:17.326 --> 00:25:21.486 A:middle
you will give it the
right option, use Metal

00:25:21.546 --> 00:25:23.136 A:middle
or OpenGL, as you want.

00:25:23.756 --> 00:25:27.366 A:middle
And what's new also is
that we have added support

00:25:27.366 --> 00:25:28.446 A:middle
for Metal shaders.

00:25:28.446 --> 00:25:31.696 A:middle
So how do you deal with shaders
in SceneKit with the new API?

00:25:32.696 --> 00:25:37.226 A:middle
The first way to use custom
shaders with SceneKit is

00:25:37.496 --> 00:25:39.556 A:middle
to use Metal shader modifiers.

00:25:39.886 --> 00:25:43.016 A:middle
Shadow modifyers used
to be only in GSL.

00:25:43.126 --> 00:25:45.296 A:middle
Now we support both languages.

00:25:45.566 --> 00:25:51.396 A:middle
If you add on GLSL modifier, it
will work as it is on OpenGL,

00:25:51.396 --> 00:25:53.336 A:middle
and it will be translated
to Metal.

00:25:54.006 --> 00:25:55.586 A:middle
It works in most situations.

00:25:56.156 --> 00:25:58.206 A:middle
If you write your
shadow modifier

00:25:58.206 --> 00:26:01.056 A:middle
with Metal shadow
language, it will not work,



00:25:58.206 --> 00:26:01.056 A:middle
with Metal shadow
language, it will not work,

00:26:01.056 --> 00:26:05.356 A:middle
it will be ignored, but
it will work as Metal.

00:26:06.676 --> 00:26:13.496 A:middle
The second way to use shaders in
SceneKit is to use SCNPrograms.

00:26:14.286 --> 00:26:16.246 A:middle
In this case, there is
no automatic translation,

00:26:16.246 --> 00:26:17.716 A:middle
so you will do it by hand.

00:26:17.946 --> 00:26:19.546 A:middle
Will you have to
translate all your code.

00:26:20.276 --> 00:26:23.196 A:middle
It's supported -- it
supports both GLSL

00:26:23.296 --> 00:26:28.266 A:middle
and Metal shading languages,
so you can support both

00:26:28.266 --> 00:26:29.396 A:middle
in the same application.

00:26:30.146 --> 00:26:31.516 A:middle
You can compile them offline.

00:26:32.316 --> 00:26:35.356 A:middle
You just have to provide the
function names for the shader

00:26:35.356 --> 00:26:37.526 A:middle
for the fragment
and vertex shader,

00:26:38.176 --> 00:26:39.926 A:middle
or you can compile
it at runtime.

00:26:39.956 --> 00:26:42.466 A:middle
In this case, you just have to
give the source code in addition

00:26:42.466 --> 00:26:44.586 A:middle
to the function names.

00:26:45.256 --> 00:26:47.106 A:middle
I will show you now
how you do it

00:26:47.776 --> 00:26:51.316 A:middle
by creating a very small shader
that would work in SceneKit.

00:26:51.386 --> 00:26:53.786 A:middle
The first operation that
you will have to do is

00:26:53.926 --> 00:26:58.526 A:middle
to include our SceneKit header
so that you can have access

00:26:58.926 --> 00:27:03.726 A:middle
to some semantics and, for
example, the default metrics.



00:26:58.926 --> 00:27:03.726 A:middle
to some semantics and, for
example, the default metrics.

00:27:04.416 --> 00:27:09.726 A:middle
Here we define our custom
vertex structure that is

00:27:09.726 --> 00:27:13.486 A:middle
in the correct data
in SceneKit thanks

00:27:13.486 --> 00:27:15.106 A:middle
to the semantic definition.

00:27:16.116 --> 00:27:21.316 A:middle
We can also define the use of
a metrics that is, for example,

00:27:21.386 --> 00:27:22.386 A:middle
the model view projection.

00:27:23.086 --> 00:27:28.116 A:middle
And we can define our own
structure with our own data

00:27:28.116 --> 00:27:30.836 A:middle
for the algorithm we
are trying to create.

00:27:32.146 --> 00:27:36.196 A:middle
Then we just have to
create the vertex function

00:27:36.776 --> 00:27:42.566 A:middle
by giving the arguments for the
structure that we have defined.

00:27:42.566 --> 00:27:43.046 A:middle
Really easy.

00:27:44.146 --> 00:27:47.916 A:middle
Then in the program, we just
define the same structures,

00:27:47.916 --> 00:27:50.236 A:middle
we have to use the same
types and the same layout

00:27:50.236 --> 00:27:52.486 A:middle
for the structure as we used
in the Metal definition.

00:27:53.626 --> 00:27:56.686 A:middle
We created a program,
give the vertex

00:27:56.686 --> 00:27:58.446 A:middle
and fragment function names.

00:27:59.736 --> 00:28:03.756 A:middle
And then we can give some
data by using the structure



00:27:59.736 --> 00:28:03.756 A:middle
And then we can give some
data by using the structure

00:28:03.756 --> 00:28:06.566 A:middle
and wrapping it around
time stamps.

00:28:07.476 --> 00:28:08.046 A:middle
Very simple.

00:28:09.696 --> 00:28:14.516 A:middle
The last way to use shaders in
SceneKit is to use techniques,

00:28:14.996 --> 00:28:16.836 A:middle
techniques were introduced
last year.

00:28:17.216 --> 00:28:19.376 A:middle
It's a great way to
do post-processing

00:28:19.376 --> 00:28:25.456 A:middle
for all your applications on the
role scene, and in this case,

00:28:25.766 --> 00:28:28.456 A:middle
you just have to give the
correct function names

00:28:28.756 --> 00:28:32.666 A:middle
for the Metal shaders in your
pass definition, and that's it.

00:28:32.836 --> 00:28:34.706 A:middle
It will work just like
the OpenGL version.

00:28:35.706 --> 00:28:37.116 A:middle
That was it for Metal.

00:28:37.116 --> 00:28:38.966 A:middle
Let's move on to
some new features

00:28:38.966 --> 00:28:40.236 A:middle
that we have added
for you this year.

00:28:41.616 --> 00:28:46.226 A:middle
The first one is the
integration with Model I/O,

00:28:46.226 --> 00:28:50.496 A:middle
so we have added the support for
Model I/O, both for importing

00:28:50.496 --> 00:28:53.426 A:middle
and exporting of your
models and scenes.

00:28:54.036 --> 00:29:01.266 A:middle
As you can see, not all the file
formats support all the data



00:28:54.036 --> 00:29:01.266 A:middle
As you can see, not all the file
formats support all the data

00:29:01.266 --> 00:29:04.376 A:middle
that we are supporting in
SceneKit, so choose the one

00:29:04.376 --> 00:29:06.886 A:middle
that is most suited
for your application.

00:29:07.496 --> 00:29:12.206 A:middle
We have also added scene
transition with one line

00:29:12.206 --> 00:29:14.336 A:middle
of code, very easy, you
can create transitions

00:29:14.336 --> 00:29:17.076 A:middle
between scenes, and
with great animations.

00:29:18.236 --> 00:29:19.886 A:middle
Really easy to use.

00:29:21.596 --> 00:29:23.596 A:middle
We have added also
debug options,

00:29:24.066 --> 00:29:27.076 A:middle
so you can visualize your
boxes, your physics shapes,

00:29:27.386 --> 00:29:30.076 A:middle
everything at one time
for debugging purposes.

00:29:30.656 --> 00:29:36.056 A:middle
We have also added
blend modes to material

00:29:36.516 --> 00:29:38.756 A:middle
so you can choose how
transparency works

00:29:38.886 --> 00:29:42.786 A:middle
for each node -- for each
material in your application.

00:29:43.446 --> 00:29:45.026 A:middle
You can create new
effects with that.

00:29:45.666 --> 00:29:50.256 A:middle
And we have also added an
audio engine that works

00:29:50.256 --> 00:29:52.266 A:middle
for everything in SceneKit.

00:29:52.796 --> 00:29:57.326 A:middle
We can create 3D sounds,
attach them to nodes,

00:29:57.436 --> 00:30:00.196 A:middle
and they will move with
the nodes in the scene.



00:29:57.436 --> 00:30:00.196 A:middle
and they will move with
the nodes in the scene.

00:30:01.076 --> 00:30:03.236 A:middle
It also works with
ambience and music,

00:30:03.236 --> 00:30:07.886 A:middle
so you can digital position
audio and loop the sound.

00:30:07.886 --> 00:30:11.196 A:middle
The listener is placed on the
camera node, but you can move it

00:30:11.196 --> 00:30:12.326 A:middle
to any node in the scene.

00:30:12.326 --> 00:30:12.996 A:middle
It's really easy.

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:18.016 A:middle
It's based on the AVAudioEngine,
so you just have to annotate

00:30:18.236 --> 00:30:22.246 A:middle
from AV audio node, and you can
do your own audio processing

00:30:22.246 --> 00:30:24.536 A:middle
if you want to if you have
an existing audio engine.

00:30:25.326 --> 00:30:29.086 A:middle
And last, we have added also
a way to created sound action

00:30:29.086 --> 00:30:32.406 A:middle
so you can integrate sound
into your action sequences.

00:30:32.406 --> 00:30:35.476 A:middle
That's really easy to do.

00:30:35.736 --> 00:30:39.076 A:middle
And here is how you
use the sound API.

00:30:39.576 --> 00:30:43.756 A:middle
First you have to instantiate an
audio sound from the file fame.

00:30:44.236 --> 00:30:46.846 A:middle
Then you create a player and
attach the player to any node

00:30:47.016 --> 00:30:50.206 A:middle
in the scene, and it will start
to play right away and stop

00:30:50.256 --> 00:30:51.136 A:middle
when the sound is finished.

00:30:51.926 --> 00:30:53.666 A:middle
If you want to do
ambience or music,

00:30:53.936 --> 00:30:57.656 A:middle
you have to just flip a switch,

00:30:58.076 --> 00:31:01.356 A:middle
like digital positional
audio and start looping.



00:30:58.076 --> 00:31:01.356 A:middle
like digital positional
audio and start looping.

00:31:03.006 --> 00:31:06.866 A:middle
And last, it's really easy to
create a play song selection.

00:31:06.866 --> 00:31:10.046 A:middle
It's just one line, and you
can run the action or add it

00:31:10.136 --> 00:31:12.226 A:middle
to an existing action sequence.

00:31:13.956 --> 00:31:18.086 A:middle
This API was used in the
sample code for all the sound,

00:31:18.606 --> 00:31:21.906 A:middle
and we used the collision
mesh as --

00:31:21.906 --> 00:31:26.436 A:middle
that Thomas showed you
sooner to detect kind

00:31:26.436 --> 00:31:29.916 A:middle
of ground the character
is working on.

00:31:30.246 --> 00:31:35.746 A:middle
For example [scratching sound]
when he walks on the grass.

00:31:36.036 --> 00:31:37.626 A:middle
Or when he walks on a rock.

00:31:38.276 --> 00:31:41.766 A:middle
It was really easy to do.

00:31:42.036 --> 00:31:42.766 A:middle
So that's about it.

00:31:42.766 --> 00:31:46.386 A:middle
And I give you back to Thomas
for the wrap-up of this session.

00:31:46.556 --> 00:31:46.866 A:middle
Thank you.

00:31:48.516 --> 00:31:52.756 A:middle
[Applause]

00:31:53.256 --> 00:31:53.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; THOMAS GOOSSENS: Okay.

00:31:53.506 --> 00:31:56.706 A:middle
So that was an overview of what
we added to SceneKit this year.

00:31:57.356 --> 00:32:00.936 A:middle
So a great new Scene Editor
that will save you tons of lines



00:31:57.356 --> 00:32:00.936 A:middle
So a great new Scene Editor
that will save you tons of lines

00:32:00.936 --> 00:32:03.736 A:middle
of code and do more for
your game insight tools,

00:32:03.926 --> 00:32:06.146 A:middle
which is usually a good idea.

00:32:06.146 --> 00:32:07.776 A:middle
A smooth transition to Metal

00:32:08.126 --> 00:32:10.386 A:middle
which should boost the
performance of your game

00:32:11.306 --> 00:32:13.786 A:middle
with nothing to do on your
side most of the time.

00:32:15.146 --> 00:32:18.336 A:middle
And some new features that were
presented, and we covered some

00:32:18.336 --> 00:32:19.406 A:middle
of them in this session,

00:32:19.576 --> 00:32:23.976 A:middle
but check the documentation
for a list.

00:32:24.726 --> 00:32:27.976 A:middle
And an amazing demo app
that we are really proud

00:32:27.976 --> 00:32:29.116 A:middle
to share the code with you.

00:32:30.066 --> 00:32:32.816 A:middle
Search for fox on the developer
website, and you should find it.

00:32:34.526 --> 00:32:38.686 A:middle
Now for more information,
please check the resources

00:32:38.686 --> 00:32:40.276 A:middle
and documentation
we have online,

00:32:41.086 --> 00:32:42.476 A:middle
and for general inquiries,

00:32:42.586 --> 00:32:44.606 A:middle
contact our Evangelist,
Allan Schaffer.

00:32:45.856 --> 00:32:49.436 A:middle
Some related sessions,
Model I/O,

00:32:49.436 --> 00:32:51.496 A:middle
great new frameworks
introduced this year,

00:32:52.536 --> 00:32:55.806 A:middle
and check the What's New
in SpriteKit session.

00:32:55.896 --> 00:32:58.786 A:middle
They have a really great
demo of the scene editors

00:32:58.786 --> 00:33:00.476 A:middle
that go much deeper
into details.



00:32:58.786 --> 00:33:00.476 A:middle
that go much deeper
into details.

00:33:00.476 --> 00:33:02.416 A:middle
So you definitely
want to see that one.

00:33:03.236 --> 00:33:04.146 A:middle
And that's about it.

00:33:04.426 --> 00:33:05.806 A:middle
Thanks, and enjoy
the conference.

00:33:05.916 --> 00:33:06.176 A:middle
Thank you.

00:33:07.508 --> 00:33:09.508 A:middle
[Applause]
