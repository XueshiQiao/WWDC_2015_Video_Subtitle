[Applause]

00:00:26.346 --> 00:00:27.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; IVAN KRSTIC: My name is
Ivan, and I head the Security

00:00:27.886 --> 00:00:31.686 A:middle
and Privacy Strategy group at
Apple, and today we are going

00:00:31.686 --> 00:00:32.555 A:middle
to talk about security.

00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:36.846 A:middle
And, in fact, most of
today's talk will focus

00:00:36.846 --> 00:00:38.626 A:middle
on security on devices.

00:00:39.436 --> 00:00:42.046 A:middle
Now, as you know, we
have a very strong lineup

00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:43.906 A:middle
of device security
features, some of them unique

00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:47.356 A:middle
to OS X others to iOS, and some
present on both our platforms.

00:00:47.456 --> 00:00:50.446 A:middle
We are continually working to
make these features better,

00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:52.126 A:middle
and you're going
to see us continue

00:00:52.126 --> 00:00:54.046 A:middle
to relentlessly innovate
in this space.

00:00:54.736 --> 00:00:57.256 A:middle
But I'm actually here today to
have a brief interlude with you

00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.476 A:middle
about network security.

00:00:58.476 --> 00:01:02.376 A:middle
When we think about network
security most of you think



00:00:58.476 --> 00:01:02.376 A:middle
When we think about network
security most of you think

00:01:02.376 --> 00:01:05.135 A:middle
of HTTPS, which most
of us experience

00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:06.846 A:middle
as the lock icon in the browser.

00:01:07.996 --> 00:01:13.076 A:middle
It used to be that
websites used HTTPS and TLS

00:01:13.286 --> 00:01:15.476 A:middle
if they were transmitting
sensitive information.

00:01:16.836 --> 00:01:18.706 A:middle
But we no longer think of things

00:01:18.706 --> 00:01:20.496 A:middle
like credit card
information as sensitive.

00:01:20.496 --> 00:01:24.166 A:middle
In fact, today we think of
all kinds of user information

00:01:24.296 --> 00:01:26.386 A:middle
as being sensitive, and
even some things that you

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:29.496 A:middle
as a developer may not think
of as sensitive, a user may.

00:01:31.436 --> 00:01:33.356 A:middle
One other really
important thing about TLS

00:01:33.356 --> 00:01:34.866 A:middle
that we don't often
think about is

00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:37.756 A:middle
that it doesn't just protect
the secrecy of information

00:01:37.756 --> 00:01:39.056 A:middle
as it moves across the network.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.876 A:middle
It also protects the
integrity of those connections.

00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:44.896 A:middle
And the threats on the
network have changed.

00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:48.856 A:middle
It's no longer just someone
wearing a black ski mask hiding

00:01:48.856 --> 00:01:50.096 A:middle
on some corner of
the Internet trying

00:01:50.096 --> 00:01:51.336 A:middle
to get your credit card numbers.

00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:53.936 A:middle
In fact, users may want
to protect themselves

00:01:53.936 --> 00:01:55.196 A:middle
against other kinds of threats.

00:01:55.606 --> 00:01:58.256 A:middle
For example, Internet
service providers

00:01:58.256 --> 00:02:00.826 A:middle
that are injecting tracking
headers into every request,



00:01:58.256 --> 00:02:00.826 A:middle
that are injecting tracking
headers into every request,

00:02:01.186 --> 00:02:03.476 A:middle
or even outright
recording browsing histories

00:02:03.526 --> 00:02:04.566 A:middle
to support ad targeting.

00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:09.795 A:middle
So in 2015 we believe that TLS
is really a minimum base line

00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:11.856 A:middle
for responsibly protecting
customer information

00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:12.796 A:middle
on the network.

00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:17.756 A:middle
But TLS is not quite enough.

00:02:18.526 --> 00:02:20.716 A:middle
Many servers still
use version 1 of TLS,

00:02:21.256 --> 00:02:23.026 A:middle
which is very old,
it's 16 years old.

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:26.756 A:middle
And the newest version of TLS,
1.2, which is 7 years old,

00:02:27.076 --> 00:02:29.206 A:middle
contains a number of really
important cryptographic

00:02:29.206 --> 00:02:31.856 A:middle
improvements to the protocol,
which make it more resilient

00:02:31.856 --> 00:02:33.986 A:middle
to the kinds of threats
that we are seeing today

00:02:33.986 --> 00:02:35.336 A:middle
and will be facing
in the future.

00:02:35.336 --> 00:02:40.036 A:middle
And in fact, even TLS
1.2 is not quite enough.

00:02:40.586 --> 00:02:43.626 A:middle
With the way TLS works,
if an attacker is able

00:02:43.626 --> 00:02:47.146 A:middle
to compromise a server and
steal your TLS key, they can use

00:02:47.146 --> 00:02:50.936 A:middle
that key to retroactively
decrypt all previously encrypted

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:51.936 A:middle
data by that server.

00:02:52.446 --> 00:02:53.906 A:middle
That's obviously
very undesirable.

00:02:54.486 --> 00:02:56.146 A:middle
There's a property
called forward secrecy

00:02:56.146 --> 00:02:57.416 A:middle
that makes it not true.

00:02:57.526 --> 00:02:59.726 A:middle
With forward secrecy,
if an attacker is able

00:02:59.726 --> 00:03:03.166 A:middle
to compromise a server and steal
the TLS key, they can only use



00:02:59.726 --> 00:03:03.166 A:middle
to compromise a server and steal
the TLS key, they can only use

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:04.986 A:middle
that key to decrypt
future traffic

00:03:05.166 --> 00:03:07.546 A:middle
that the server encrypts,
but no prior traffic.

00:03:08.556 --> 00:03:10.816 A:middle
And this is great because
it mitigates bulk recording

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:13.686 A:middle
of network encrypted data.

00:03:13.876 --> 00:03:17.246 A:middle
TLS supports forward secrecy
and it does it through the use

00:03:17.246 --> 00:03:19.436 A:middle
of what are called cipher
suites which are combinations

00:03:19.436 --> 00:03:21.506 A:middle
of cryptographic primitives
that you actually have

00:03:21.506 --> 00:03:22.746 A:middle
to enable on your server.

00:03:23.356 --> 00:03:26.786 A:middle
So your server need only not
run just TLS, but in fact needs

00:03:26.846 --> 00:03:29.746 A:middle
to run TLS 1.2, and in order
to get forward secrecy,

00:03:29.746 --> 00:03:31.076 A:middle
you must configure
it to do that.

00:03:32.236 --> 00:03:33.696 A:middle
So why am I telling
you all of this?

00:03:33.696 --> 00:03:42.506 A:middle
Well, here is a quote from Tim,
and I will let you read it.

00:03:42.786 --> 00:03:44.366 A:middle
&gt;&gt; "We must get this right."

00:03:45.026 --> 00:03:47.366 A:middle
And to help you get it right,

00:03:48.586 --> 00:03:50.926 A:middle
we're introducing a feature
called App Transport Security.

00:03:51.696 --> 00:03:52.666 A:middle
Here's how it works.

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:58.406 A:middle
If you link your app against
OS X El Capitan or iOS 9,

00:03:59.546 --> 00:04:00.736 A:middle
by default it won't be able



00:03:59.546 --> 00:04:00.736 A:middle
by default it won't be able

00:04:00.736 --> 00:04:03.106 A:middle
to make any unprotected
HTTP connections;

00:04:03.106 --> 00:04:05.816 A:middle
they will simply fail,
and any TLS connections

00:04:05.816 --> 00:04:09.276 A:middle
that your app makes will have no
adhere to these best practices

00:04:09.276 --> 00:04:10.196 A:middle
that I just described.

00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:12.456 A:middle
And that's TLS 1.2
with forward secrecy.

00:04:13.016 --> 00:04:14.446 A:middle
Cryptographic primitives
that are known

00:04:14.446 --> 00:04:16.176 A:middle
to be insecure are not allowed,

00:04:16.505 --> 00:04:18.826 A:middle
and there are minimum key size
requirements put in place.

00:04:19.516 --> 00:04:21.776 A:middle
Now, you may not be
able to comply with all

00:04:21.776 --> 00:04:25.116 A:middle
of these restrictions
immediately, and that's okay,

00:04:25.116 --> 00:04:27.636 A:middle
you can specify exceptions
in your Info.plist either

00:04:27.636 --> 00:04:31.856 A:middle
on a case-by-case basis for each
domain or as a global override.

00:04:32.456 --> 00:04:35.826 A:middle
But, as an industry we have
to very soon get to a point

00:04:35.826 --> 00:04:38.366 A:middle
where no user information
hits the network unencrypted,

00:04:39.486 --> 00:04:40.166 A:middle
and we need your help.

00:04:41.676 --> 00:04:42.996 A:middle
Thank you for that
and I will turn it

00:04:42.996 --> 00:04:44.986 A:middle
over to my colleague Pierre
who's going to tell you

00:04:44.986 --> 00:04:46.276 A:middle
about System Integrity
Protection.

00:04:47.516 --> 00:04:50.976 A:middle
[Applause]

00:04:51.476 --> 00:04:52.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; PIERRE-OLIVIER
MARTEL: Thank you Ivan.

00:04:54.466 --> 00:04:57.466 A:middle
Hi everyone, my name is
Pierre-Olivier Martel.

00:04:57.546 --> 00:04:59.086 A:middle
I'm the engineering manager

00:04:59.086 --> 00:05:01.116 A:middle
for Sandboxing Technologies
here at Apple.



00:04:59.086 --> 00:05:01.116 A:middle
for Sandboxing Technologies
here at Apple.

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:03.386 A:middle
And today I'm here
to talk to you

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:04.836 A:middle
about System Integrity
Protection

00:05:05.396 --> 00:05:07.036 A:middle
which is a new hardening
mechanism

00:05:07.236 --> 00:05:08.926 A:middle
that we are introducing
in El Capitan.

00:05:10.346 --> 00:05:13.546 A:middle
Before I dive into the details,
I would like to take a step back

00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:15.386 A:middle
and provide some context

00:05:15.386 --> 00:05:16.646 A:middle
around what we're
trying to achieve here.

00:05:17.906 --> 00:05:23.176 A:middle
My team's mission at Apple is
to make sure that our users get

00:05:23.176 --> 00:05:25.766 A:middle
to enjoy the great user
experience that comes

00:05:25.766 --> 00:05:28.056 A:middle
with our product,
with the confidence

00:05:28.096 --> 00:05:32.376 A:middle
that their personal data is
protected and that malware

00:05:32.656 --> 00:05:35.586 A:middle
or even simply a poorly
written piece of software,

00:05:35.946 --> 00:05:39.196 A:middle
only has a limited impact
on their user experience.

00:05:39.616 --> 00:05:44.376 A:middle
So to that end we've designed
and integrated various pieces

00:05:44.376 --> 00:05:47.516 A:middle
of security technologies,
as Ivan mentioned before,

00:05:47.996 --> 00:05:51.296 A:middle
over the year in iOS and OS X.

00:05:51.296 --> 00:05:52.546 A:middle
One of the quotas and principles

00:05:52.546 --> 00:05:56.446 A:middle
that we applied there is the
concept of defense in depth.

00:05:57.196 --> 00:06:00.096 A:middle
Now, the key principle here is
something you've probably heard



00:05:57.196 --> 00:06:00.096 A:middle
Now, the key principle here is
something you've probably heard

00:06:00.096 --> 00:06:03.186 A:middle
before, which is that
security is all about layers.

00:06:04.226 --> 00:06:06.956 A:middle
And for the same reason that you
shouldn't put all of your eggs

00:06:06.956 --> 00:06:11.106 A:middle
in the same basket, you
shouldn't rely on a single layer

00:06:11.106 --> 00:06:12.996 A:middle
of protection to
defend the device,

00:06:13.786 --> 00:06:18.166 A:middle
because no matter how
bulletproof, or water resistant,

00:06:18.166 --> 00:06:21.636 A:middle
or shock absorbent this layer
is, when it starts failing you,

00:06:22.376 --> 00:06:25.426 A:middle
then it's complete game over.

00:06:25.666 --> 00:06:28.746 A:middle
Instead, you should rely on
multiple layers of protection,

00:06:29.456 --> 00:06:32.796 A:middle
ideally with different
security properties

00:06:33.296 --> 00:06:35.576 A:middle
that will delay the
advance of an attacker

00:06:36.086 --> 00:06:37.386 A:middle
and reduce your attack surface.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:41.286 A:middle
Now, the concept of defense

00:06:41.286 --> 00:06:43.626 A:middle
in depth is an old military
concept that's been used

00:06:43.756 --> 00:06:48.296 A:middle
to defend fortresses all around
the world for centuries for now.

00:06:48.656 --> 00:06:49.886 A:middle
Because I you know
you guys like trivia,

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:52.656 A:middle
I can tell that you it
was actually formalized

00:06:52.656 --> 00:06:57.516 A:middle
by this gentleman, Sebastien
de Vauban, in the 1670s,

00:06:57.516 --> 00:06:59.056 A:middle
when he was asked by
the King of France

00:06:59.496 --> 00:07:01.566 A:middle
to rebuild all the
fortresses around the country



00:06:59.496 --> 00:07:01.566 A:middle
to rebuild all the
fortresses around the country

00:07:02.166 --> 00:07:04.766 A:middle
that were used to
defend the kingdom.

00:07:05.696 --> 00:07:08.086 A:middle
And you may not be
familiar with the character,

00:07:08.086 --> 00:07:11.026 A:middle
but maybe you've seen
some of his work before.

00:07:11.286 --> 00:07:13.636 A:middle
That's the design of
one of his castles.

00:07:14.046 --> 00:07:16.056 A:middle
You can clearly see several
layers of protection here

00:07:16.056 --> 00:07:17.966 A:middle
that are designed to stop
different kinds of attacks

00:07:18.946 --> 00:07:22.216 A:middle
and that will basically delay
the attacker and funnel him

00:07:22.296 --> 00:07:27.446 A:middle
through different bottlenecks
that are easier to defend.

00:07:28.196 --> 00:07:31.656 A:middle
So let's see how this applies
to the OS X security model.

00:07:32.526 --> 00:07:34.906 A:middle
And I don't know about you,
but I've always dreamed

00:07:34.906 --> 00:07:37.206 A:middle
to build my own fort,
so there it is,

00:07:37.836 --> 00:07:41.186 A:middle
and we'll put our own
security layers on it.

00:07:41.736 --> 00:07:44.556 A:middle
Starting from the bottom,
we'll start with Gatekeeper.

00:07:45.736 --> 00:07:49.406 A:middle
So Gatekeeper makes sure that an
application that gets downloaded

00:07:49.406 --> 00:07:54.046 A:middle
from the Internet onto the
user's machine has to be signed

00:07:54.326 --> 00:07:56.596 A:middle
by a -- we have a
Developer ID certificate

00:07:56.656 --> 00:07:58.416 A:middle
that Apple has issued
to a developer,

00:07:59.106 --> 00:08:02.596 A:middle
otherwise the application
does not get to launch.



00:07:59.106 --> 00:08:02.596 A:middle
otherwise the application
does not get to launch.

00:08:03.886 --> 00:08:06.146 A:middle
And combined with some
other mechanism that we have

00:08:06.146 --> 00:08:08.856 A:middle
on the system, like some
malware detection mechanism,

00:08:09.306 --> 00:08:11.586 A:middle
then it's actually a
pretty effective measure

00:08:12.446 --> 00:08:16.106 A:middle
to stop a massive malware
attack on our ecosystem.

00:08:16.596 --> 00:08:19.436 A:middle
The second layer is Sandbox.

00:08:20.786 --> 00:08:23.526 A:middle
So back in Lion, we
introduced App Sandbox

00:08:23.976 --> 00:08:24.936 A:middle
and we mad it mandatory

00:08:24.936 --> 00:08:28.676 A:middle
for applications coming
from the App Store.

00:08:28.896 --> 00:08:32.196 A:middle
We also highly recommended it
for applications coming outside

00:08:32.196 --> 00:08:34.546 A:middle
of the App Store, like for
instance using the Developer

00:08:34.546 --> 00:08:35.066 A:middle
ID program.

00:08:36.496 --> 00:08:38.476 A:middle
Sandbox is a containment
mechanism.

00:08:39.236 --> 00:08:40.736 A:middle
Which means that it
makes sure that even

00:08:40.736 --> 00:08:42.296 A:middle
if your application
gets exploited,

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:46.106 A:middle
then the application only
has access to the data

00:08:46.106 --> 00:08:47.346 A:middle
that the user actually gave it,

00:08:47.786 --> 00:08:50.466 A:middle
which means the application
cannot steal all the user's

00:08:50.466 --> 00:08:53.766 A:middle
data, and cannot compromise
the rest of the system.

00:08:54.236 --> 00:08:58.376 A:middle
The third layer, if you
manage to go through

00:08:58.376 --> 00:09:02.426 A:middle
or around the first two, is the
classic POSIX permission scheme,



00:08:58.376 --> 00:09:02.426 A:middle
or around the first two, is the
classic POSIX permission scheme,

00:09:03.196 --> 00:09:05.776 A:middle
which means that your
application only runs

00:09:05.776 --> 00:09:09.206 A:middle
with the set of privileges that
the system granted to your user.

00:09:09.796 --> 00:09:12.586 A:middle
So the application won't be
able to access data owned

00:09:12.586 --> 00:09:14.826 A:middle
by a different user
and it won't be able

00:09:14.826 --> 00:09:17.396 A:middle
to modify a systemwide
configuration settings

00:09:17.396 --> 00:09:19.706 A:middle
that are usually owned
by the root user.

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:25.386 A:middle
And finally, we can think of the
Keychain as yet another layer

00:09:25.386 --> 00:09:26.866 A:middle
on top of that, which
is designed

00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:28.886 A:middle
to protect the user's secrets.

00:09:29.416 --> 00:09:33.666 A:middle
It relies on cryptography
and application separation

00:09:34.266 --> 00:09:37.866 A:middle
to make sure that only the
application that's stored a

00:09:37.866 --> 00:09:40.736 A:middle
secret in the first place
can get back to it later.

00:09:42.656 --> 00:09:44.366 A:middle
So when you look at
the big picture here,

00:09:45.066 --> 00:09:46.476 A:middle
you realize a couple of things.

00:09:47.576 --> 00:09:51.896 A:middle
First, Gatekeeper will stop
untrusted code downloaded

00:09:51.896 --> 00:09:54.416 A:middle
on the machine from
being launched.

00:09:55.336 --> 00:09:57.366 A:middle
But it's not actually a
containment mechanism.

00:09:57.366 --> 00:09:59.126 A:middle
It doesn't stop the application

00:09:59.126 --> 00:10:01.486 A:middle
when it's run from
doing anything.



00:09:59.126 --> 00:10:01.486 A:middle
when it's run from
doing anything.

00:10:02.276 --> 00:10:05.516 A:middle
Also, it does not protect code
that's already on the machine.

00:10:05.516 --> 00:10:07.196 A:middle
So code that ships with
the OS, for instance,

00:10:07.196 --> 00:10:08.946 A:middle
is not protected by it.

00:10:09.916 --> 00:10:13.926 A:middle
Then, sandboxing, although it's
probably the most effective

00:10:14.216 --> 00:10:17.256 A:middle
containment mechanism
we have on the platform,

00:10:17.256 --> 00:10:19.196 A:middle
is only an opt-in in OS X.

00:10:19.856 --> 00:10:22.646 A:middle
So there's no requirement
for every single process

00:10:22.966 --> 00:10:26.936 A:middle
to actually run in a sandbox.

00:10:26.936 --> 00:10:30.366 A:middle
Finally, when you look at the
POSIX layer, you realize that,

00:10:31.516 --> 00:10:36.476 A:middle
well, most of the Macs out there
are actually single user systems

00:10:37.066 --> 00:10:40.466 A:middle
where the user is the de
facto administrator running

00:10:40.466 --> 00:10:43.716 A:middle
with administrative
privileges all the time.

00:10:44.836 --> 00:10:46.866 A:middle
The root account is
usually protected

00:10:46.866 --> 00:10:52.186 A:middle
or hidden behind an often weak
password or no password at all.

00:10:52.186 --> 00:10:55.296 A:middle
And in fact, if there is a
password and you ask for it,

00:10:55.506 --> 00:10:56.946 A:middle
the users likely give it to you.

00:10:58.186 --> 00:11:02.926 A:middle
And finally, when you root, then
you actually have full control



00:10:58.186 --> 00:11:02.926 A:middle
And finally, when you root, then
you actually have full control

00:11:02.926 --> 00:11:06.266 A:middle
on the machine, because root can
disable all security measures

00:11:06.376 --> 00:11:06.986 A:middle
on the device.

00:11:07.686 --> 00:11:10.956 A:middle
It can replace the
kernel extensions,

00:11:11.466 --> 00:11:15.286 A:middle
it can replace launchd, any
other security services,

00:11:15.816 --> 00:11:17.956 A:middle
it can even interfere
with the Keychain layers

00:11:17.956 --> 00:11:20.426 A:middle
that sit on top of it.

00:11:20.686 --> 00:11:24.036 A:middle
So the reality is that once you
have code running on the Mac,

00:11:24.536 --> 00:11:26.706 A:middle
it's actually not that
hard to become root,

00:11:27.196 --> 00:11:28.986 A:middle
and once you are root, you have
full control of the machine.

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:31.806 A:middle
Which means that any piece

00:11:31.806 --> 00:11:33.786 A:middle
of malware is actually
one password,

00:11:33.786 --> 00:11:35.546 A:middle
or one vulnerability away

00:11:35.916 --> 00:11:40.336 A:middle
from taking full
control of the device.

00:11:40.416 --> 00:11:44.336 A:middle
This shows us that we
need another layer.

00:11:45.416 --> 00:11:48.346 A:middle
We need a layer that will
eliminate the power of root

00:11:48.516 --> 00:11:52.046 A:middle
on the machine and protect
the system by default,

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:54.506 A:middle
as it was installed by
Apple on the machine.

00:11:55.346 --> 00:11:57.026 A:middle
Both on disk and at runtime.

00:11:57.566 --> 00:12:02.036 A:middle
And because we are talking
about taking some power away



00:11:57.566 --> 00:12:02.036 A:middle
And because we are talking
about taking some power away

00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:05.276 A:middle
from root, then we need

00:12:05.276 --> 00:12:06.856 A:middle
to provide a configuration
mechanism

00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:09.886 A:middle
that root itself
cannot compromise,

00:12:10.846 --> 00:12:14.126 A:middle
but that can give away
this power back to root.

00:12:15.296 --> 00:12:18.086 A:middle
This is what System
Integrated Protection is.

00:12:18.876 --> 00:12:21.366 A:middle
It is a new security
policy that applies

00:12:21.406 --> 00:12:24.006 A:middle
to every single process
running on the system.

00:12:24.646 --> 00:12:26.526 A:middle
Regardless of whether
this process is running

00:12:26.526 --> 00:12:29.856 A:middle
with extra privileges, or
if it's running unsandboxed.

00:12:30.296 --> 00:12:33.896 A:middle
It's designed to
provide extra protections

00:12:34.216 --> 00:12:37.916 A:middle
to system components, both
on disk and at runtime,

00:12:39.096 --> 00:12:43.106 A:middle
and it makes it so that system
binaries are only modifiable

00:12:43.106 --> 00:12:46.886 A:middle
by the installer, if it installs
an Apple signed package,

00:12:48.096 --> 00:12:50.006 A:middle
or the Software Update
mechanism.

00:12:50.706 --> 00:12:54.316 A:middle
And finally, that the system
binaries are protected

00:12:54.386 --> 00:12:58.426 A:middle
from runtime attachments,
and from code injection.

00:12:58.976 --> 00:13:01.556 A:middle
So before we dive
into the details here,



00:12:58.976 --> 00:13:01.556 A:middle
So before we dive
into the details here,

00:13:01.976 --> 00:13:05.276 A:middle
let's see how this is going
to impact you the developers.

00:13:06.426 --> 00:13:09.556 A:middle
Well the good news is that
if you ship your application

00:13:09.556 --> 00:13:12.256 A:middle
on the App Store, then your
application is not impacted

00:13:12.256 --> 00:13:16.496 A:middle
by any of this, because
the App Store guidelines

00:13:16.636 --> 00:13:18.616 A:middle
and the app sandbox policy,

00:13:18.796 --> 00:13:20.546 A:middle
already prohibits all
of these behaviors.

00:13:21.506 --> 00:13:23.616 A:middle
However, if you ship
outside of the store,

00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:26.606 A:middle
then your application is
potentially impacted by this,

00:13:27.136 --> 00:13:31.616 A:middle
if it relies on being able
to modify system binaries

00:13:31.736 --> 00:13:32.896 A:middle
or frameworks on disk.

00:13:33.436 --> 00:13:36.276 A:middle
If it needs to be able
to install content

00:13:36.686 --> 00:13:39.966 A:middle
in system locations, and I
will explain a little bit

00:13:39.966 --> 00:13:41.756 A:middle
about what system
locations mean in here.

00:13:42.416 --> 00:13:45.176 A:middle
And finally, if your
application needs

00:13:45.176 --> 00:13:47.986 A:middle
to inspect the memory
states of any process

00:13:48.096 --> 00:13:52.046 A:middle
on a system including system
processes, or if it needs

00:13:52.046 --> 00:13:56.536 A:middle
to be able to inject libraries
or debug over processes,

00:13:56.696 --> 00:13:57.706 A:middle
including system processes.

00:13:59.456 --> 00:14:02.576 A:middle
So let's look at the key
aspects of this new mechanism.



00:13:59.456 --> 00:14:02.576 A:middle
So let's look at the key
aspects of this new mechanism.

00:14:03.076 --> 00:14:05.666 A:middle
First, we look at new
filesystem restrictions

00:14:05.946 --> 00:14:08.566 A:middle
that we are introducing
in Capitan,

00:14:08.566 --> 00:14:11.006 A:middle
and then we'll see
how these extend

00:14:11.316 --> 00:14:13.426 A:middle
to new runtime protections.

00:14:14.736 --> 00:14:17.206 A:middle
Finally, we'll see
how this all ties

00:14:17.206 --> 00:14:20.166 A:middle
in with the kernel
extension development workflow

00:14:20.166 --> 00:14:23.526 A:middle
and how it potentially impacts
you if you are a kext developer.

00:14:23.526 --> 00:14:27.346 A:middle
And then because the feature
can entirely be disabled,

00:14:28.006 --> 00:14:29.516 A:middle
I will just show you how.

00:14:30.016 --> 00:14:32.536 A:middle
Let's talk about the
filesystem first.

00:14:33.966 --> 00:14:35.456 A:middle
What we're trying to
achieve here is we want

00:14:35.456 --> 00:14:39.866 A:middle
to protect system content
from being modified.

00:14:40.486 --> 00:14:45.876 A:middle
To do so, the installer will
actually flag system content

00:14:45.876 --> 00:14:47.866 A:middle
as it installs the
files on disk.

00:14:48.646 --> 00:14:50.976 A:middle
We have a new filesystem flag
that we introduced in Capitan.

00:14:51.986 --> 00:14:56.536 A:middle
And then later on, at runtime,
the kernel will stop any attempt

00:14:56.846 --> 00:14:58.946 A:middle
at modifying these
protected files

00:14:58.946 --> 00:15:02.046 A:middle
or protected folders
unless the attempt comes



00:14:58.946 --> 00:15:02.046 A:middle
or protected folders
unless the attempt comes

00:15:02.046 --> 00:15:05.196 A:middle
from a specially
entitled process,

00:15:05.416 --> 00:15:07.916 A:middle
of which there's only
a handful on Capitan.

00:15:09.016 --> 00:15:12.136 A:middle
It will also stop you from
writing to the block devices

00:15:12.306 --> 00:15:13.886 A:middle
that back this protected
content.

00:15:15.216 --> 00:15:16.776 A:middle
And it will stop
you from mounting

00:15:16.966 --> 00:15:18.886 A:middle
over this protected content.

00:15:19.846 --> 00:15:22.126 A:middle
And one thing you have to
keep in mind is that for now,

00:15:22.406 --> 00:15:25.166 A:middle
this only applies to the
root, and the boot volume

00:15:25.576 --> 00:15:27.906 A:middle
of the currently running OS.

00:15:27.996 --> 00:15:30.736 A:middle
So you should see this
as a way for the system

00:15:31.046 --> 00:15:36.126 A:middle
to protect itself at runtime.

00:15:36.266 --> 00:15:39.316 A:middle
Now, because we are trying to
protect system content on disk,

00:15:39.316 --> 00:15:41.326 A:middle
we need to have a
clear separation

00:15:41.326 --> 00:15:43.596 A:middle
between system content
and third-party content.

00:15:44.896 --> 00:15:48.876 A:middle
So in Capitan, all the
locations that are on the left

00:15:48.876 --> 00:15:52.016 A:middle
of this chart will now be
considered system locations.

00:15:52.846 --> 00:15:54.426 A:middle
Which means that the system
will actually stop you

00:15:54.426 --> 00:15:56.986 A:middle
from writing there,
including if it comes

00:15:57.036 --> 00:15:57.886 A:middle
in an installer package.

00:15:58.366 --> 00:16:01.226 A:middle
So it should not
impact many of you here



00:15:58.366 --> 00:16:01.226 A:middle
So it should not
impact many of you here

00:16:01.226 --> 00:16:03.686 A:middle
because we've been
advising for many years now,

00:16:03.986 --> 00:16:05.376 A:middle
that you shouldn't write
to these locations.

00:16:05.746 --> 00:16:08.556 A:middle
But it's not going to be
a hard failure in Capitan

00:16:08.556 --> 00:16:10.666 A:middle
if your package installs
content in there.

00:16:11.506 --> 00:16:13.216 A:middle
So if you install
anything in /System,

00:16:13.216 --> 00:16:16.776 A:middle
you need to move this content
into the appropriate subfolder

00:16:17.116 --> 00:16:20.666 A:middle
of /Library, if it's supposed
to be system wide content,

00:16:21.256 --> 00:16:24.316 A:middle
or (tilde)/Library if it's
supposed to be user content.

00:16:24.836 --> 00:16:32.156 A:middle
If you install anything in /bin,
or /sbin, or anywhere under /usr

00:16:32.186 --> 00:16:36.446 A:middle
like /usr/bin, /usr/lib,
/usr/libexec, then you need

00:16:36.446 --> 00:16:39.266 A:middle
to move this content into
the appropriate subfolder

00:16:39.596 --> 00:16:44.336 A:middle
of the /usr/local folder,
because that's the only location

00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:45.926 A:middle
that is now available
to third-parties.

00:16:46.356 --> 00:16:50.466 A:middle
And then a reminder
that the best location

00:16:50.466 --> 00:16:52.516 A:middle
for your content is
still /Applications

00:16:52.656 --> 00:16:55.536 A:middle
because that's the location
that is visible to the user

00:16:56.136 --> 00:16:58.796 A:middle
and it's easy for them to
actually drag your application

00:16:58.796 --> 00:17:00.516 A:middle
to the trash and just
remove all content.



00:16:58.796 --> 00:17:00.516 A:middle
to the trash and just
remove all content.

00:17:01.856 --> 00:17:07.506 A:middle
One important note here,
that when the user upgrades

00:17:07.685 --> 00:17:10.695 A:middle
from a Yosemite install,
to a Capitan install,

00:17:11.435 --> 00:17:14.806 A:middle
the installer will actually
migrate any third-party content

00:17:14.806 --> 00:17:17.766 A:middle
that it finds in
system locations outside

00:17:17.766 --> 00:17:18.506 A:middle
of these locations.

00:17:19.656 --> 00:17:23.165 A:middle
So you need to make sure that
today you start migrating

00:17:23.165 --> 00:17:25.945 A:middle
that content away as soon
as possible so as not

00:17:25.945 --> 00:17:26.816 A:middle
to impact these users.

00:17:26.816 --> 00:17:31.606 A:middle
Now, let's look at the
runtime protections.

00:17:33.086 --> 00:17:35.766 A:middle
Being able to modify the
behavior of a process

00:17:35.906 --> 00:17:39.016 A:middle
at runtime is more
equivalent to being able

00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:40.836 A:middle
to modify the binary on disk.

00:17:41.506 --> 00:17:43.256 A:middle
So if you try to protect
the binary on disk

00:17:43.516 --> 00:17:46.126 A:middle
and the system content on
disk, we have to make sure

00:17:46.396 --> 00:17:49.616 A:middle
that it's not possible to inject
code or modify the behavior

00:17:50.276 --> 00:17:51.536 A:middle
of these system processes.

00:17:52.696 --> 00:17:56.716 A:middle
To do so, we are introducing
a new restricted flag

00:17:57.356 --> 00:18:00.426 A:middle
in the process structure
that the kernel holds



00:17:57.356 --> 00:18:00.426 A:middle
in the process structure
that the kernel holds

00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:01.806 A:middle
for every single process.

00:18:03.046 --> 00:18:06.086 A:middle
And a kernel will set
that flag at exact time

00:18:06.846 --> 00:18:11.116 A:middle
if the main executable
is protected on disk,

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:13.306 A:middle
or if the main executable
is signed

00:18:13.306 --> 00:18:14.606 A:middle
with an Apple-private
entitlement.

00:18:15.036 --> 00:18:22.546 A:middle
And then later on, the system
will actually treat these

00:18:22.846 --> 00:18:24.906 A:middle
restricted processes
slightly differently

00:18:24.906 --> 00:18:26.076 A:middle
than regular processes.

00:18:26.196 --> 00:18:29.406 A:middle
For one, the task-for-pid

00:18:29.956 --> 00:18:35.016 A:middle
and the processor-set-tasks SPI
will now fail if they are called

00:18:35.116 --> 00:18:36.296 A:middle
on a restricted process.

00:18:37.236 --> 00:18:39.626 A:middle
And will set an 0 to EPERM.

00:18:40.616 --> 00:18:44.196 A:middle
Which means that if part of your
product relies on being able

00:18:44.196 --> 00:18:48.076 A:middle
to attach to a system process
at runtime, for instance,

00:18:48.266 --> 00:18:51.226 A:middle
the Finder, and that you expect
to be able to inject code

00:18:51.226 --> 00:18:56.246 A:middle
into the Finder, that is
not going to work anymore.

00:18:56.276 --> 00:19:00.676 A:middle
Then if you fork an exec,
a binary that will result



00:18:56.276 --> 00:19:00.676 A:middle
Then if you fork an exec,
a binary that will result

00:19:00.796 --> 00:19:03.236 A:middle
in the child process
being restricted,

00:19:03.286 --> 00:19:07.246 A:middle
then the system will
automatically reset the mach

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:08.956 A:middle
special ports on
this child process,

00:19:09.666 --> 00:19:11.976 A:middle
which means you won't
be able to keep control

00:19:12.366 --> 00:19:13.576 A:middle
over the child process.

00:19:14.436 --> 00:19:18.156 A:middle
So if you expect to be able
to fork a privileged tool

00:19:18.586 --> 00:19:19.776 A:middle
and then keep control on it,

00:19:19.896 --> 00:19:23.156 A:middle
that's not going
to work anymore.

00:19:23.256 --> 00:19:27.526 A:middle
The linker is going to ignore
all the dyld environment

00:19:27.526 --> 00:19:29.486 A:middle
variables on these
protected binaries.

00:19:30.256 --> 00:19:33.396 A:middle
So if you expect to be
able to inject the library

00:19:33.566 --> 00:19:35.506 A:middle
into a system binary
when you exec it,

00:19:36.116 --> 00:19:38.746 A:middle
the linker will just
ignore the new library.

00:19:39.286 --> 00:19:44.386 A:middle
And finally, if you use
dtrace, all dtrace probes

00:19:44.556 --> 00:19:49.176 A:middle
that target a restricted process
will not be matched anymore,

00:19:49.876 --> 00:19:51.786 A:middle
which means you won't be
able to see an interaction

00:19:51.786 --> 00:19:55.076 A:middle
between the process
and the kernel.

00:19:55.076 --> 00:19:58.716 A:middle
You won't be able to inspect the
restricted process memory space

00:19:58.926 --> 00:20:00.956 A:middle
and you won't be able to
inspect the kernel memory.



00:19:58.926 --> 00:20:00.956 A:middle
and you won't be able to
inspect the kernel memory.

00:20:01.556 --> 00:20:05.386 A:middle
Of course, this applies
to our own debugger, LLDB.

00:20:05.386 --> 00:20:09.586 A:middle
If you try to invoke lldb
even as root and try to attach

00:20:09.586 --> 00:20:15.046 A:middle
to the Finder, then
this is going to fail.

00:20:15.276 --> 00:20:17.386 A:middle
Now, when it comes to
the kext signing program,

00:20:17.756 --> 00:20:21.336 A:middle
I'm sure you know by now, all
extensions have to be signed

00:20:21.606 --> 00:20:24.966 A:middle
with a Developer ID for Kexts
certificate that was issued

00:20:24.966 --> 00:20:28.856 A:middle
by Apple, and then these
extensions have to be installed

00:20:29.236 --> 00:20:31.096 A:middle
into /Library/Extensions.

00:20:31.576 --> 00:20:33.826 A:middle
The new thing here is

00:20:33.826 --> 00:20:37.626 A:middle
that because we are pulling
the kext signing program

00:20:38.346 --> 00:20:42.026 A:middle
under the System Integrity
Protection umbrella,

00:20:42.576 --> 00:20:45.116 A:middle
the kext-dev-mode
boot-arg is now obsolete.

00:20:46.196 --> 00:20:49.996 A:middle
If you are a kext developer,
you need to be able to test

00:20:50.096 --> 00:20:52.416 A:middle
with unsigned kernel
extensions, you will need

00:20:52.416 --> 00:20:55.596 A:middle
to disable this protection, and
I'll show you how in a minute.

00:20:56.036 --> 00:20:59.696 A:middle
But it also means that,
this comment line here

00:20:59.696 --> 00:21:02.846 A:middle
that you probably saw out
there to disable kext signing,



00:20:59.696 --> 00:21:02.846 A:middle
that you probably saw out
there to disable kext signing,

00:21:03.096 --> 00:21:04.196 A:middle
is not doing anything anymore.

00:21:04.196 --> 00:21:10.326 A:middle
So let's talk about the
configuration mechanism.

00:21:10.326 --> 00:21:14.506 A:middle
We strongly believe
that this new mechanism,

00:21:14.506 --> 00:21:17.126 A:middle
this new protection, is
critical for our users.

00:21:17.536 --> 00:21:21.856 A:middle
That being said, we realize that
it gets in the way of people

00:21:21.856 --> 00:21:24.416 A:middle
who want to have complete
control over their machine,

00:21:25.386 --> 00:21:26.636 A:middle
and because of what
I said before,

00:21:26.876 --> 00:21:28.406 A:middle
because it protects
the kernel on disk

00:21:28.906 --> 00:21:31.536 A:middle
and requires all kernel
extensions to be signed,

00:21:32.196 --> 00:21:34.806 A:middle
then it also gets in the way
of kext developers who want

00:21:34.806 --> 00:21:36.766 A:middle
to be able to test
with unsigned kext.

00:21:37.716 --> 00:21:40.186 A:middle
So because of that, it
can be entirely disabled.

00:21:41.206 --> 00:21:44.776 A:middle
The configuration is stored
in your NVRAM setting,

00:21:45.256 --> 00:21:48.136 A:middle
which means that it applies
to the entire machine.

00:21:48.476 --> 00:21:50.416 A:middle
So if you have several
installs of Capitan,

00:21:50.766 --> 00:21:52.496 A:middle
they will all be
configured the same way

00:21:53.466 --> 00:21:55.516 A:middle
and it's persistent
across OS install.

00:21:55.646 --> 00:21:59.196 A:middle
So as you move from seed 1 to
seed 2 up to GM and even later,

00:21:59.766 --> 00:22:01.306 A:middle
the configuration will persist.



00:21:59.766 --> 00:22:01.306 A:middle
the configuration will persist.

00:22:01.446 --> 00:22:03.256 A:middle
So we won't reset it
every time we install.

00:22:03.256 --> 00:22:08.156 A:middle
Now, because root can
actually set a NVRAM setting

00:22:08.266 --> 00:22:10.636 A:middle
and we can't trust root to
do the right thing here,

00:22:11.086 --> 00:22:13.326 A:middle
it means we cannot have
the configuration mechanism

00:22:13.426 --> 00:22:14.446 A:middle
in the OS itself.

00:22:15.076 --> 00:22:17.556 A:middle
So we actually pulled it and
installed it in the Recovery OS.

00:22:17.716 --> 00:22:20.656 A:middle
So this NVRAM setting can
only be set in Recovery.

00:22:21.766 --> 00:22:23.026 A:middle
If you want to change
the configuration,

00:22:23.786 --> 00:22:26.336 A:middle
you need to reboot your machine
in Recovery OS, and you can do

00:22:26.336 --> 00:22:29.526 A:middle
so by holding the
Command+R key on boot.

00:22:30.546 --> 00:22:32.566 A:middle
Then all you have to do
is launch the Security

00:22:32.566 --> 00:22:35.246 A:middle
Configuration application
from the Utilities menu,

00:22:36.326 --> 00:22:38.556 A:middle
and check the System
Integrity Protection box,

00:22:39.376 --> 00:22:40.706 A:middle
apply and reboot.

00:22:41.536 --> 00:22:44.506 A:middle
Keep in mind that these types
that I just describe are likely

00:22:44.506 --> 00:22:46.316 A:middle
to change in an upcoming seed.

00:22:46.446 --> 00:22:49.416 A:middle
So make sure you read
the release notes

00:22:49.536 --> 00:22:51.666 A:middle
to know what the new steps are.

00:22:53.676 --> 00:22:57.066 A:middle
So let's summarize what
we discussed so far.

00:22:57.276 --> 00:22:59.996 A:middle
System Integrity Protection
is a new policy that applies

00:22:59.996 --> 00:23:01.196 A:middle
to every process on the system.



00:22:59.996 --> 00:23:01.196 A:middle
to every process on the system.

00:23:02.276 --> 00:23:06.516 A:middle
It protects the system as it was
installed by Apple, both on disk

00:23:06.616 --> 00:23:10.436 A:middle
and at runtime, by
restricting write access

00:23:10.846 --> 00:23:14.986 A:middle
to system locations, and by
preventing runtime attachment

00:23:15.946 --> 00:23:18.596 A:middle
and code injection
on system processes.

00:23:19.076 --> 00:23:23.216 A:middle
The installer will actively
migrate third-party content

00:23:23.336 --> 00:23:25.216 A:middle
outside of system locations,

00:23:25.216 --> 00:23:27.046 A:middle
so make sure you actually
migrate your content as soon

00:23:27.046 --> 00:23:29.396 A:middle
as possible or that you
fall back gracefully

00:23:29.396 --> 00:23:30.726 A:middle
when you can't find it.

00:23:31.356 --> 00:23:35.526 A:middle
Then finally, the feature can be
disabled using the configuration

00:23:35.526 --> 00:23:38.526 A:middle
mechanism that is
in the Recovery OS.

00:23:39.416 --> 00:23:40.216 A:middle
That's it for me.

00:23:40.456 --> 00:23:41.236 A:middle
Thank you very much, guys.

00:23:41.646 --> 00:23:42.556 A:middle
I will leave the
stage to Andrew.

00:23:43.516 --> 00:23:48.506 A:middle
[Applause]

00:23:49.006 --> 00:23:49.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; ANDREW WHALLEY:
Thank you, Pierre.

00:23:51.666 --> 00:23:54.716 A:middle
I'm Andrew Whalley, and I
manage the data security group

00:23:54.846 --> 00:23:56.966 A:middle
within Core OS Security
Engineering.

00:23:57.516 --> 00:24:01.466 A:middle
You heard about app
transport security,



00:23:57.516 --> 00:24:01.466 A:middle
You heard about app
transport security,

00:24:02.136 --> 00:24:04.626 A:middle
and how it helps
protect data in motion,

00:24:05.026 --> 00:24:07.006 A:middle
through the network
connections your app makes.

00:24:07.626 --> 00:24:09.746 A:middle
I'm going to look
at the various ways

00:24:09.746 --> 00:24:12.326 A:middle
that you can protect
data at rest.

00:24:12.876 --> 00:24:16.206 A:middle
I will touch on the Keychain
and storing user secrets,

00:24:17.496 --> 00:24:21.796 A:middle
look at Touch ID and how you
can use it to balance security

00:24:21.846 --> 00:24:24.186 A:middle
and convenience in your app.

00:24:25.236 --> 00:24:29.306 A:middle
Along the way, I will be looking
at existing technologies as well

00:24:29.306 --> 00:24:32.936 A:middle
as what's new in iOS 9 and
how they can fit together

00:24:33.406 --> 00:24:37.256 A:middle
to deliver a level of security
appropriate for your apps.

00:24:39.696 --> 00:24:42.656 A:middle
So let's start with a quick
overview of the Keychain.

00:24:43.226 --> 00:24:46.586 A:middle
You can think of it as a
very specialized database.

00:24:47.456 --> 00:24:51.416 A:middle
You store data by adding rows,
which we call Keychain items,

00:24:51.896 --> 00:24:54.696 A:middle
and then query for them
with the attributes.

00:24:55.196 --> 00:25:01.316 A:middle
It's optimized for small secrets
and by secret I mean a password,



00:24:55.196 --> 00:25:01.316 A:middle
It's optimized for small secrets
and by secret I mean a password,

00:25:01.316 --> 00:25:04.766 A:middle
a token or cookie,
or cryptographic key.

00:25:06.126 --> 00:25:10.516 A:middle
If you have tens of thousands,
thousands of megabytes to store,

00:25:10.856 --> 00:25:15.556 A:middle
consider using file-based data
protection or a bulk encryption

00:25:16.036 --> 00:25:18.326 A:middle
through an API like
Common Crypto

00:25:18.406 --> 00:25:20.176 A:middle
and then just store the
key in the Keychain.

00:25:24.956 --> 00:25:27.976 A:middle
These SecItem APIs have
been around a long time,

00:25:28.256 --> 00:25:30.646 A:middle
but they're still the best
place to store secrets,

00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:33.066 A:middle
including in your
new Swift apps.

00:25:34.176 --> 00:25:37.906 A:middle
So here we have a secret
and we want to store it

00:25:37.906 --> 00:25:40.206 A:middle
in the Keychain using
SecItemAdd.

00:25:41.146 --> 00:25:44.356 A:middle
To do that, we construct
a dictionary

00:25:44.716 --> 00:25:46.486 A:middle
which includes both the secret

00:25:46.956 --> 00:25:51.726 A:middle
and some attributes describing
how to find it in the future

00:25:52.296 --> 00:25:54.166 A:middle
and what protection
it should have.

00:25:55.576 --> 00:25:59.606 A:middle
This pattern of creating a
dictionary to describe or query

00:25:59.606 --> 00:26:05.106 A:middle
for an item, is also used by
the calls to query, delete,



00:25:59.606 --> 00:26:05.106 A:middle
for an item, is also used by
the calls to query, delete,

00:26:05.106 --> 00:26:08.536 A:middle
and update an item, as well
as some of the other APIs,

00:26:08.536 --> 00:26:10.046 A:middle
I should be talking about later.

00:26:11.396 --> 00:26:13.466 A:middle
There's a lot more
about Keychain APIs

00:26:13.506 --> 00:26:17.076 A:middle
in Session 709 from 2013's WWDC.

00:26:17.076 --> 00:26:21.866 A:middle
So here's some things
to consider

00:26:22.416 --> 00:26:25.156 A:middle
when you are writing code
to access the Keychain.

00:26:26.696 --> 00:26:30.866 A:middle
The first is dealing with user
secrets is a really security

00:26:30.866 --> 00:26:32.326 A:middle
sensitive part of your code.

00:26:33.106 --> 00:26:37.456 A:middle
So you should factor it into
small, simple, testable units.

00:26:37.926 --> 00:26:44.256 A:middle
Often this is done
with a wrapper class.

00:26:44.426 --> 00:26:46.586 A:middle
Whether you are using it
directly or through a wrapper,

00:26:47.116 --> 00:26:49.716 A:middle
make sure it has the
highest level of protection

00:26:50.396 --> 00:26:52.296 A:middle
that your application can use.

00:26:53.666 --> 00:26:56.996 A:middle
We describe and talk about
data protection classes,

00:26:57.526 --> 00:27:02.926 A:middle
which are the times at which
cryptographic access is provided



00:26:57.526 --> 00:27:02.926 A:middle
which are the times at which
cryptographic access is provided

00:27:02.926 --> 00:27:03.796 A:middle
to those items.

00:27:03.926 --> 00:27:06.366 A:middle
For example, when the
device is unlocked.

00:27:06.956 --> 00:27:11.646 A:middle
In iOS 8, we added the
AfterFirstUnlock --

00:27:11.646 --> 00:27:15.046 A:middle
I beg your pardon.

00:27:15.046 --> 00:27:18.326 A:middle
That's been around for a while,
but you can use it if you have

00:27:18.576 --> 00:27:21.776 A:middle
to access items in the
background, for example,

00:27:21.776 --> 00:27:26.926 A:middle
if you are a VoIP app.

00:27:27.156 --> 00:27:30.636 A:middle
Always accessible is going
to be deprecated in iOS 9.

00:27:31.056 --> 00:27:33.126 A:middle
So you need to start
moving items out of

00:27:33.246 --> 00:27:34.686 A:middle
that into a higher level.

00:27:40.216 --> 00:27:44.496 A:middle
We have WatchKit 2, your
Watch apps now have access

00:27:44.556 --> 00:27:49.006 A:middle
to the SecItem APIs, though
entering a full user name

00:27:49.006 --> 00:27:52.486 A:middle
and password on the Watch is
probably not the user experience

00:27:52.486 --> 00:27:52.876 A:middle
you want.

00:27:54.416 --> 00:27:58.496 A:middle
If your Watch app is displaying
data from a paired iOS device,

00:27:59.076 --> 00:28:01.406 A:middle
consider just sending
that content across



00:27:59.076 --> 00:28:01.406 A:middle
consider just sending
that content across

00:28:01.736 --> 00:28:03.756 A:middle
and not a persistent credential.

00:28:04.416 --> 00:28:07.956 A:middle
If your Watch app does
need direct access

00:28:08.806 --> 00:28:11.566 A:middle
to a credential then
consider rather

00:28:11.566 --> 00:28:14.456 A:middle
than storing a full
user name and password,

00:28:15.166 --> 00:28:18.076 A:middle
have your server send
you a token or a cookie

00:28:18.376 --> 00:28:22.506 A:middle
that only has the permissions
to access the content

00:28:22.686 --> 00:28:26.136 A:middle
that the focused functionality
of your Watch app requires.

00:28:26.676 --> 00:28:33.546 A:middle
It's not just on the
Watch that user name

00:28:33.546 --> 00:28:35.726 A:middle
and password prompts
can be inconvenient,

00:28:36.406 --> 00:28:39.566 A:middle
and over the last few releases
we have introduced a couple

00:28:39.566 --> 00:28:42.836 A:middle
of technologies to help you
prompt for passwords less often.

00:28:44.516 --> 00:28:47.076 A:middle
The first is shared
web credentials.

00:28:48.576 --> 00:28:51.796 A:middle
We all know and love
Safari saved passwords

00:28:52.276 --> 00:28:55.506 A:middle
and how it will suggest
and store them for us.

00:28:56.096 --> 00:29:00.436 A:middle
With iCloud Keychain, passwords
will be synced and autofilled



00:28:56.096 --> 00:29:00.436 A:middle
With iCloud Keychain, passwords
will be synced and autofilled

00:29:00.436 --> 00:29:01.486 A:middle
on all of your devices.

00:29:02.006 --> 00:29:05.226 A:middle
However, it's common
for a service

00:29:05.226 --> 00:29:08.166 A:middle
to have both a website
and an iOS app.

00:29:08.766 --> 00:29:12.606 A:middle
So it would be great to have
those applications participate

00:29:12.766 --> 00:29:14.366 A:middle
in Safari saved passwords

00:29:15.106 --> 00:29:19.506 A:middle
and with shared web
credentials you can.

00:29:19.686 --> 00:29:22.276 A:middle
Here's some code you might
want to include in the sign-up

00:29:22.346 --> 00:29:24.706 A:middle
or the registration flow
of your application.

00:29:27.316 --> 00:29:29.896 A:middle
SecCreateShared
WebCredentialPassword will

00:29:29.896 --> 00:29:33.476 A:middle
return a random string in the
same format that Safari uses

00:29:33.476 --> 00:29:34.946 A:middle
for it's suggested passwords.

00:29:36.296 --> 00:29:38.606 A:middle
Can you can call
SecAddSharedWebCredential

00:29:38.606 --> 00:29:42.396 A:middle
to let Safari know that there's
a new user name and password

00:29:42.646 --> 00:29:44.636 A:middle
to autofill for a
specific domain.

00:29:47.396 --> 00:29:51.086 A:middle
In iOS 9, we've made it easy to
give this functionality a try

00:29:51.486 --> 00:29:53.476 A:middle
by relaxing some of
the security checks

00:29:53.476 --> 00:29:54.766 A:middle
when you're running
in the Simulator.

00:29:54.766 --> 00:29:59.086 A:middle
So let's have a look at that.

00:29:59.196 --> 00:30:02.816 A:middle
Here I'm going through the
registration flow of my app



00:29:59.196 --> 00:30:02.816 A:middle
Here I'm going through the
registration flow of my app

00:30:03.226 --> 00:30:06.306 A:middle
to which I just added the code
I showed you a few moments ago.

00:30:06.306 --> 00:30:12.026 A:middle
After that, just pop in
to the settings for Safari

00:30:12.026 --> 00:30:15.746 A:middle
and make sure that name and
password autofill is enabled.

00:30:16.386 --> 00:30:19.426 A:middle
Go to Safari and
see the results.

00:30:19.426 --> 00:30:25.336 A:middle
Here we are back in the
app, being presented

00:30:25.826 --> 00:30:29.146 A:middle
with a user name
and password prompt.

00:30:29.236 --> 00:30:32.826 A:middle
Shared web credentials
allows the application

00:30:32.826 --> 00:30:36.716 A:middle
to display a picker, which lists
all the accounts Safari has

00:30:36.716 --> 00:30:37.696 A:middle
saved for that domain.

00:30:38.246 --> 00:30:43.036 A:middle
When the user has
picked one, the user name

00:30:43.036 --> 00:30:46.456 A:middle
and password is returned to your
app in the completion handler

00:30:46.456 --> 00:30:51.616 A:middle
for SharedWebCredential and
you can then log the user

00:30:51.726 --> 00:30:52.246 A:middle
straight in.

00:30:52.246 --> 00:30:58.116 A:middle
If you want to use this
on device and not just

00:30:58.116 --> 00:31:01.216 A:middle
in the simulator, you're going
to have to add an entitlement



00:30:58.116 --> 00:31:01.216 A:middle
in the simulator, you're going
to have to add an entitlement

00:31:01.216 --> 00:31:04.026 A:middle
to your application,
and you can do this

00:31:04.026 --> 00:31:06.116 A:middle
in the Associated
Domains section

00:31:06.236 --> 00:31:08.186 A:middle
of the Capabilities
tab in Xcode.

00:31:08.736 --> 00:31:13.776 A:middle
You are also going to
need to put a JSON file

00:31:13.886 --> 00:31:16.376 A:middle
up on your server, but you
might have this already.

00:31:16.726 --> 00:31:19.256 A:middle
As it's the same one
used for Handoff,

00:31:19.816 --> 00:31:24.926 A:middle
as well as in iOS 9 app links.

00:31:29.796 --> 00:31:31.646 A:middle
One change we have made in iOS 9

00:31:31.646 --> 00:31:35.116 A:middle
to make adoption even easier is
you no longer need separately

00:31:35.116 --> 00:31:35.996 A:middle
sign that file.

00:31:36.546 --> 00:31:39.406 A:middle
It's going to be protected
with a secure TLS connection.

00:31:45.216 --> 00:31:49.256 A:middle
I mentioned that Safari saved
passwords uses iCloud Keychain,

00:31:49.646 --> 00:31:52.046 A:middle
but you can also use it
directly in your own apps.

00:31:53.156 --> 00:31:59.066 A:middle
Imagine you have an iOS, iPad,
iPhone, and OS X App Store app

00:31:59.376 --> 00:32:01.986 A:middle
and you want to make
logging into one the same



00:31:59.376 --> 00:32:01.986 A:middle
and you want to make
logging into one the same

00:32:01.986 --> 00:32:03.426 A:middle
as logging into them all.

00:32:03.866 --> 00:32:08.016 A:middle
So for all of your apps
passwords that can be used

00:32:08.016 --> 00:32:12.056 A:middle
on multiple devices, consider
just adding the synchronizable

00:32:12.056 --> 00:32:13.886 A:middle
attribute to all SecItem calls.

00:32:13.886 --> 00:32:17.256 A:middle
There are a few things that
you've got to think about,

00:32:17.256 --> 00:32:19.976 A:middle
for example, deleting an item
will delete it everywhere,

00:32:20.116 --> 00:32:22.696 A:middle
so make sure you only do that
under the right circumstances.

00:32:23.166 --> 00:32:27.036 A:middle
There are a few more
caveats, and you can see the,

00:32:27.036 --> 00:32:32.056 A:middle
in SecItem.h. If you are
interested in finding out more

00:32:32.056 --> 00:32:34.256 A:middle
about the security
of iCloud Keychain

00:32:34.746 --> 00:32:37.906 A:middle
and how synced passwords are
never accessible to anyone

00:32:37.906 --> 00:32:41.116 A:middle
but the user, see the
iOS Security White Paper.

00:32:41.536 --> 00:32:43.096 A:middle
There's a link at the
end of the session.

00:32:43.666 --> 00:32:51.306 A:middle
So to recap, on the Keychain,
store all your secrets there.

00:32:51.476 --> 00:32:53.376 A:middle
There really is no
place for passwords

00:32:53.376 --> 00:32:55.316 A:middle
in plain text files or plists.

00:32:56.506 --> 00:32:58.976 A:middle
Protect them at the
highest level possible

00:32:59.456 --> 00:33:03.026 A:middle
and if appropriate use
SharedWedCredentials



00:32:59.456 --> 00:33:03.026 A:middle
and if appropriate use
SharedWedCredentials

00:33:03.026 --> 00:33:06.276 A:middle
like our Keychain to sync them
around your user's devices

00:33:06.336 --> 00:33:08.906 A:middle
and present fewer
password prompts.

00:33:12.636 --> 00:33:15.586 A:middle
So iCloud Keychain is great
for the secrets that can go

00:33:15.586 --> 00:33:18.486 A:middle
on multiple devices but
sometimes you want them

00:33:18.486 --> 00:33:21.546 A:middle
to stay firmly and
securely on just one device.

00:33:22.176 --> 00:33:25.636 A:middle
An example might be a
secure messaging app,

00:33:26.006 --> 00:33:29.956 A:middle
where encryption is device to
device rather than user to user.

00:33:30.516 --> 00:33:35.536 A:middle
The various protection classes
I already mentions have a

00:33:35.536 --> 00:33:37.236 A:middle
ThisDeviceOnly variant.

00:33:38.126 --> 00:33:40.906 A:middle
Items will be backed up,
but only ever restored

00:33:40.906 --> 00:33:44.366 A:middle
to the device they came from.

00:33:44.366 --> 00:33:47.796 A:middle
Last year, we added the
WhenPassCodeSet class,

00:33:48.286 --> 00:33:50.476 A:middle
that ensures items
are always protected

00:33:50.576 --> 00:33:52.546 A:middle
by a local device passcode.

00:33:53.096 --> 00:33:56.166 A:middle
And you can use AccessControl
lists

00:33:56.166 --> 00:33:59.356 A:middle
for even finer grained
control over items.

00:33:59.356 --> 00:34:04.696 A:middle
So since we are talking



00:33:59.356 --> 00:34:04.696 A:middle
So since we are talking

00:34:04.816 --> 00:34:07.446 A:middle
about protecting
device-specific credentials,

00:34:07.866 --> 00:34:10.906 A:middle
let's look at the security
domains on an iOS device.

00:34:12.315 --> 00:34:14.806 A:middle
User space, where
your application runs,

00:34:15.666 --> 00:34:19.106 A:middle
and the kernel, which as Pierre
mentioned provides process

00:34:19.106 --> 00:34:21.216 A:middle
separation and other
security functionality.

00:34:22.545 --> 00:34:25.835 A:middle
But it also provides many,
many other OS facilities,

00:34:26.045 --> 00:34:28.335 A:middle
which means it has quite
a large attack service.

00:34:29.036 --> 00:34:32.315 A:middle
So with iPhone 5s, we
added Secure Enclave.

00:34:34.795 --> 00:34:40.676 A:middle
Secure Enclave is a separate on
core that has been architected

00:34:40.815 --> 00:34:43.525 A:middle
from the ground up
with security in mind.

00:34:44.176 --> 00:34:48.266 A:middle
That's where we put Touch
ID to ensure the privacy

00:34:48.266 --> 00:34:50.866 A:middle
and the security of your
fingerprint biometrics.

00:34:52.636 --> 00:34:55.696 A:middle
We also moved the KeyStore
component from the kernel

00:34:55.696 --> 00:34:58.516 A:middle
into Secure Enclave
and it's that component

00:34:58.876 --> 00:35:02.056 A:middle
which controls the cryptography
around Keychain items



00:34:58.876 --> 00:35:02.056 A:middle
which controls the cryptography
around Keychain items

00:35:02.166 --> 00:35:03.076 A:middle
and the data protection.

00:35:07.016 --> 00:35:11.026 A:middle
So let's focus for a
moment on Touch ID.

00:35:11.306 --> 00:35:13.546 A:middle
While we think of it as
a security technology,

00:35:13.946 --> 00:35:16.356 A:middle
where it really excels
is convenience.

00:35:17.156 --> 00:35:18.936 A:middle
You can unlock your
device without having

00:35:18.936 --> 00:35:20.316 A:middle
to enter your passcode
all the time,

00:35:20.846 --> 00:35:24.456 A:middle
but that itself can give
us some security benefits.

00:35:25.116 --> 00:35:29.036 A:middle
For example it's now much easier
to have a long, complex passcode

00:35:29.896 --> 00:35:32.126 A:middle
which improves the
security of data protection.

00:35:33.466 --> 00:35:37.976 A:middle
Or your phone can now lock
immediately so it's vulnerable

00:35:37.976 --> 00:35:44.756 A:middle
and unlocked for as
small a time as possible.

00:35:44.756 --> 00:35:48.646 A:middle
In iOS 8, we provided some
APIs so you can use Touch ID

00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:50.026 A:middle
in your own applications

00:35:50.076 --> 00:35:52.486 A:middle
as you balance security
and convenience.

00:35:53.176 --> 00:35:55.556 A:middle
But why two and how
do they differ?

00:35:56.886 --> 00:35:59.566 A:middle
Well to understand you're going
to have to know how Touch ID

00:35:59.566 --> 00:36:01.496 A:middle
and biometrics security works.



00:35:59.566 --> 00:36:01.496 A:middle
and biometrics security works.

00:36:01.846 --> 00:36:03.616 A:middle
But luckily, it's very simple.

00:36:03.616 --> 00:36:05.366 A:middle
It boils down to
an if statement.

00:36:06.306 --> 00:36:10.006 A:middle
If a presented finger matches
one that's been enrolled,

00:36:10.546 --> 00:36:11.786 A:middle
then do something.

00:36:12.176 --> 00:36:16.386 A:middle
It's what that something
is, and where it happens

00:36:16.946 --> 00:36:17.826 A:middle
that makes the difference.

00:36:18.306 --> 00:36:22.806 A:middle
Let's start with
Local Authentication.

00:36:24.496 --> 00:36:28.496 A:middle
A finger is placed on the
Touch ID sensor and is matched

00:36:28.496 --> 00:36:29.556 A:middle
within the Secure Enclave.

00:36:31.776 --> 00:36:33.246 A:middle
With Local Authentication,

00:36:33.296 --> 00:36:36.156 A:middle
knowledge of the match
just a Boolean success

00:36:36.156 --> 00:36:38.906 A:middle
or failure, is sent to your app.

00:36:39.776 --> 00:36:43.226 A:middle
And it's there that
your app does something

00:36:43.356 --> 00:36:46.576 A:middle
with that knowledge.

00:36:46.736 --> 00:36:51.746 A:middle
So while the process started
in Secure Enclave, ultimately,

00:36:51.746 --> 00:36:54.976 A:middle
it's the application
in user space

00:36:55.436 --> 00:36:59.006 A:middle
where a security
decision is being made.



00:37:00.976 --> 00:37:02.906 A:middle
So when might you
want to use Touch ID

00:37:02.906 --> 00:37:04.146 A:middle
with Local Authentication?

00:37:05.476 --> 00:37:09.076 A:middle
Think about your app and if
you have any security barriers,

00:37:09.546 --> 00:37:12.796 A:middle
such as requiring a passcode
to confirm an operation,

00:37:13.346 --> 00:37:15.326 A:middle
even though the user
is already logged in.

00:37:15.326 --> 00:37:19.236 A:middle
Touch ID at that
would be much easier.

00:37:19.316 --> 00:37:24.696 A:middle
Or maybe you always wanted
to have an extra step

00:37:24.696 --> 00:37:27.626 A:middle
in an authentication
process but without Touch ID,

00:37:27.626 --> 00:37:30.486 A:middle
it would have been really
just too much of a barrier.

00:37:31.156 --> 00:37:37.066 A:middle
So, for example, you could
prompt before viewing,

00:37:37.066 --> 00:37:38.446 A:middle
especially sensitive data.

00:37:39.036 --> 00:37:49.616 A:middle
Or before an operation like
permanently deleting an account.

00:37:49.786 --> 00:37:52.356 A:middle
One pattern is to have
a Touch ID prompt early

00:37:52.486 --> 00:37:53.666 A:middle
in your application's flow.

00:37:55.026 --> 00:37:58.246 A:middle
But this can lead to a situation
where the user has just unlocked

00:37:58.246 --> 00:38:01.666 A:middle
with Touch ID, and then moments
later has been prompted again



00:37:58.246 --> 00:38:01.666 A:middle
with Touch ID, and then moments
later has been prompted again

00:38:01.666 --> 00:38:02.536 A:middle
by your application.

00:38:04.476 --> 00:38:09.216 A:middle
In iOS 9, we have added
the TouchIDAuthentication

00:38:09.216 --> 00:38:11.946 A:middle
AllowableReuseDuration,
which is a property

00:38:11.946 --> 00:38:13.696 A:middle
on the Local Authentication
context.

00:38:14.816 --> 00:38:17.696 A:middle
You can use this to
specify a window during

00:38:17.696 --> 00:38:19.596 A:middle
which you won't need
to prompt again

00:38:20.086 --> 00:38:22.356 A:middle
if the user has recently
unlocked their device

00:38:22.526 --> 00:38:23.846 A:middle
with Touch ID.

00:38:24.776 --> 00:38:28.546 A:middle
So that's one way to make
your policy a little more lax.

00:38:29.376 --> 00:38:32.366 A:middle
But maybe you want to make your
policy a little more strict

00:38:32.526 --> 00:38:33.576 A:middle
in some situations.

00:38:33.576 --> 00:38:39.756 A:middle
For example, by reacting to a
new fingerprint being enrolled.

00:38:40.416 --> 00:38:44.146 A:middle
Also new, we have the
evaluatedPolicyDomainState

00:38:44.146 --> 00:38:44.616 A:middle
property.

00:38:45.216 --> 00:38:47.836 A:middle
It's a totally opaque value

00:38:48.266 --> 00:38:51.066 A:middle
that represents the current
set of enrolled fingers.

00:38:51.156 --> 00:38:55.626 A:middle
All you can really do with
it is compare it over time.

00:38:56.406 --> 00:39:00.566 A:middle
If it changed, then a finger
has been added or removed



00:38:56.406 --> 00:39:00.566 A:middle
If it changed, then a finger
has been added or removed

00:39:00.566 --> 00:39:02.406 A:middle
to the enrolled set in settings.

00:39:02.956 --> 00:39:07.056 A:middle
If you detect that,
and it's appropriate

00:39:07.056 --> 00:39:11.266 A:middle
for your application, maybe
you can prompt again to see

00:39:11.266 --> 00:39:14.056 A:middle
if users still wants to use
Touch ID on your application,

00:39:14.566 --> 00:39:17.226 A:middle
or require a password
to reenable it.

00:39:19.336 --> 00:39:22.876 A:middle
So let's recap what's new for
Local Authentication in iOS 9.

00:39:23.466 --> 00:39:27.146 A:middle
I have already mentioned
AllowableReuseDuration,

00:39:27.326 --> 00:39:28.666 A:middle
and PolicyDomainState.

00:39:29.266 --> 00:39:34.396 A:middle
You can also invalidate a
Local Authentication context

00:39:34.896 --> 00:39:38.836 A:middle
and if a Touch ID prompt is
currently being presented

00:39:38.836 --> 00:39:42.746 A:middle
to the user, it will behave as
if the user had hit canceled

00:39:43.176 --> 00:39:46.116 A:middle
and tear down the dialogue.

00:39:46.236 --> 00:39:50.316 A:middle
evaluateAccessControl allows
Local Authentication to be used

00:39:50.366 --> 00:39:53.396 A:middle
with Keychain Access
Control Lists, I will touch

00:39:53.396 --> 00:39:56.126 A:middle
on that later and there's
also a lot more examples

00:39:56.226 --> 00:40:00.256 A:middle
in some example code
we are releasing today.



00:39:56.226 --> 00:40:00.256 A:middle
in some example code
we are releasing today.

00:40:01.736 --> 00:40:04.306 A:middle
So talking of Keychain
Access Control Lists,

00:40:04.306 --> 00:40:06.486 A:middle
that's the second way
you can use Touch ID

00:40:06.486 --> 00:40:07.606 A:middle
within your application,

00:40:08.216 --> 00:40:10.966 A:middle
by using it to protect
specific Keychain items.

00:40:12.306 --> 00:40:13.956 A:middle
Here's our architecture
diagram again.

00:40:15.136 --> 00:40:18.916 A:middle
As before, the Touch ID match
occurs in Secure Enclave

00:40:19.646 --> 00:40:22.626 A:middle
but this time, knowledge
of the match is sent

00:40:23.156 --> 00:40:27.286 A:middle
within Secure Enclave
to the KeyStore.

00:40:27.366 --> 00:40:32.486 A:middle
Only then will your Keychain
item be released back

00:40:32.926 --> 00:40:33.676 A:middle
to your application.

00:40:34.286 --> 00:40:39.886 A:middle
So this is useful in you
want to add protection

00:40:39.886 --> 00:40:41.796 A:middle
to a particular saved
credential.

00:40:42.356 --> 00:40:46.286 A:middle
And to take advantage
of additional security

00:40:46.696 --> 00:40:48.616 A:middle
around Secure Enclave.

00:40:48.616 --> 00:40:54.106 A:middle
Maybe at the moment you've
looked at the security tradeoffs

00:40:54.106 --> 00:40:55.526 A:middle
of your particular application

00:40:55.776 --> 00:40:58.216 A:middle
and there are some things you
really don't want to save,

00:40:58.216 --> 00:41:00.406 A:middle
you're prompting every
time or very frequently.



00:40:58.216 --> 00:41:00.406 A:middle
you're prompting every
time or very frequently.

00:41:01.866 --> 00:41:04.236 A:middle
Maybe using Access Control
Lists you can save it,

00:41:04.386 --> 00:41:05.386 A:middle
protect it with Touch ID

00:41:05.386 --> 00:41:07.906 A:middle
and provide a more
convenient experience.

00:41:09.666 --> 00:41:12.396 A:middle
Or you could use it to
increase the security

00:41:12.686 --> 00:41:14.646 A:middle
of something you're
already saving.

00:41:17.676 --> 00:41:19.586 A:middle
You create access control lists

00:41:19.586 --> 00:41:21.686 A:middle
by specifying two
security properties.

00:41:21.686 --> 00:41:25.876 A:middle
The first is effectively
the data protection class.

00:41:26.656 --> 00:41:30.296 A:middle
That's when the data is
cryptographically accessible

00:41:31.086 --> 00:41:33.096 A:middle
to the Secure Enclave.

00:41:33.096 --> 00:41:34.926 A:middle
Next, you specify a policy.

00:41:35.556 --> 00:41:38.306 A:middle
The policy describes a condition

00:41:38.306 --> 00:41:41.996 A:middle
that must be met before Secure
Enclave will release the item

00:41:42.126 --> 00:41:44.906 A:middle
even if it has cryptographic
access to it.

00:41:47.236 --> 00:41:50.826 A:middle
So let's have a look
at the policy types.

00:41:51.676 --> 00:41:53.466 A:middle
The first is .UserPresence.

00:41:54.036 --> 00:41:56.826 A:middle
This will prompt for a
Touch ID match and fall back

00:41:56.826 --> 00:41:57.936 A:middle
to the device passcode.

00:41:58.036 --> 00:42:00.276 A:middle
And you can go straight



00:41:58.036 --> 00:42:00.276 A:middle
And you can go straight

00:42:00.276 --> 00:42:02.376 A:middle
to .DevicePasscode
as well if you want.

00:42:02.976 --> 00:42:07.006 A:middle
New in iOS 9, it's .TouchIDAny.

00:42:08.406 --> 00:42:12.156 A:middle
This will require a Touch ID
match and there is no fallback.

00:42:13.786 --> 00:42:17.986 A:middle
Also new, and stricter
still, is .TouchIDCurrentSet.

00:42:19.186 --> 00:42:22.446 A:middle
With this, items will only
be released if the set

00:42:22.446 --> 00:42:24.606 A:middle
of enrolled fingers
has not changed

00:42:24.916 --> 00:42:26.346 A:middle
since the item was stored.

00:42:26.816 --> 00:42:31.496 A:middle
I'm going to focus on
this because it might be

00:42:31.496 --> 00:42:33.356 A:middle
that your application
could benefit

00:42:33.356 --> 00:42:36.416 A:middle
from this providing a form of
multifactor authentication.

00:42:36.416 --> 00:42:40.726 A:middle
When you think about multiple
factors, you often talk

00:42:40.726 --> 00:42:46.086 A:middle
about something you know, like a
password, and something you have

00:42:46.086 --> 00:42:49.776 A:middle
and carry with you, like a
physical token, a smart card,

00:42:50.806 --> 00:42:54.686 A:middle
or maybe an iOS device with
Secure Enclave and Touch ID.

00:42:56.576 --> 00:42:59.066 A:middle
If you store an item, protected

00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:02.986 A:middle
with the TouchIDCurrentSet
policy, there's no way to get



00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:02.986 A:middle
with the TouchIDCurrentSet
policy, there's no way to get

00:43:02.986 --> 00:43:06.266 A:middle
at the item without a
successful Touch ID match.

00:43:07.506 --> 00:43:08.576 A:middle
There's no fallback.

00:43:09.316 --> 00:43:13.956 A:middle
And if maybe an adversary
has the device passcode,

00:43:14.616 --> 00:43:17.246 A:middle
they can't go into
settings, enroll a finger,

00:43:17.246 --> 00:43:24.496 A:middle
and then have access
to that item.

00:43:24.716 --> 00:43:27.266 A:middle
The last two policies,
.ApplicationPassword

00:43:27.266 --> 00:43:29.716 A:middle
and .PrivateKeyUsage allow you

00:43:29.716 --> 00:43:31.706 A:middle
to implement some
advanced functionality

00:43:31.706 --> 00:43:33.606 A:middle
that goes beyond Touch ID.

00:43:34.536 --> 00:43:36.506 A:middle
The first is
ApplicationPassword.

00:43:36.996 --> 00:43:40.226 A:middle
To help illustrate,
let's look at how an item

00:43:40.226 --> 00:43:43.166 A:middle
in the WhenUnlocked class is
cryptographically protected.

00:43:43.716 --> 00:43:47.716 A:middle
In the same way that even
the best door lock is useless

00:43:47.716 --> 00:43:49.186 A:middle
if you've left your
key in the door,

00:43:49.596 --> 00:43:52.026 A:middle
encrypted data isn't
actually protected

00:43:52.466 --> 00:43:54.296 A:middle
if stored alongside the key.

00:43:55.716 --> 00:43:59.636 A:middle
The security of data protection
and the Keychain comes

00:43:59.636 --> 00:44:03.066 A:middle
down to the device passcode
and that's stored in one



00:43:59.636 --> 00:44:03.066 A:middle
down to the device passcode
and that's stored in one

00:44:03.066 --> 00:44:06.176 A:middle
of the most complex systems
we know, the user's brain.

00:44:08.176 --> 00:44:10.576 A:middle
They remember it, enter
it into the device,

00:44:10.686 --> 00:44:14.306 A:middle
and we take that passcode and
derive a cryptographic key

00:44:14.526 --> 00:44:19.786 A:middle
and it's that, which
decrypts the item.

00:44:20.006 --> 00:44:22.436 A:middle
Now, let's look at
an item protected

00:44:22.436 --> 00:44:23.726 A:middle
with ApplicationPassword.

00:44:28.156 --> 00:44:32.086 A:middle
Just the device passcode
is no longer sufficient.

00:44:33.636 --> 00:44:36.516 A:middle
Your application has also got
to provide its own password.

00:44:37.566 --> 00:44:41.496 A:middle
Again, we derive a cryptographic
key from it, and it's only

00:44:41.496 --> 00:44:45.366 A:middle
when the device passcode and the
app password are both present

00:44:45.966 --> 00:44:48.806 A:middle
that access is granted
to the Keychain item.

00:44:49.356 --> 00:44:55.266 A:middle
As I mentioned, if you store the
password on device or it's baked

00:44:55.266 --> 00:44:57.866 A:middle
into your app, this
really doesn't offer any

00:44:57.866 --> 00:44:58.736 A:middle
additional protection.

00:44:58.736 --> 00:45:00.796 A:middle
So you have to think
about where off



00:44:58.736 --> 00:45:00.796 A:middle
So you have to think
about where off

00:45:00.796 --> 00:45:02.916 A:middle
that device you can
store that password.

00:45:04.406 --> 00:45:07.506 A:middle
Maybe it's up on a server, which
can implement its own policy

00:45:07.506 --> 00:45:09.766 A:middle
about when it's released
back to your app.

00:45:10.816 --> 00:45:13.866 A:middle
Or perhaps you have a
physical accessory and you want

00:45:13.866 --> 00:45:16.766 A:middle
to prove the user has it.

00:45:16.766 --> 00:45:19.506 A:middle
If the accessory can't
give your app a password,

00:45:20.376 --> 00:45:22.666 A:middle
then it can't decrypt
a Keychain item

00:45:23.136 --> 00:45:25.426 A:middle
and you know it's not present.

00:45:28.696 --> 00:45:34.076 A:middle
To use ApplicationPasswords, you
create both a AccessControl list

00:45:34.616 --> 00:45:36.526 A:middle
and a Local Authentication
context.

00:45:37.626 --> 00:45:39.506 A:middle
The first says please
use application password

00:45:39.506 --> 00:45:43.176 A:middle
for this item, and the second
specifies the password itself.

00:45:43.706 --> 00:45:47.296 A:middle
You then take both of
these and add to them

00:45:47.296 --> 00:45:49.446 A:middle
to the dictionary you
passed the SecItem call.

00:45:49.446 --> 00:45:56.746 A:middle
This is an example of using a
Local Authentication context

00:45:56.966 --> 00:45:59.106 A:middle
in conjunction with
the Keychain item.

00:45:59.106 --> 00:46:03.136 A:middle
So that was ApplicationPassword.



00:45:59.106 --> 00:46:03.136 A:middle
So that was ApplicationPassword.

00:46:04.436 --> 00:46:07.116 A:middle
The final new policy,
it's Private Key Usage.

00:46:07.576 --> 00:46:10.636 A:middle
Here's the diagram from earlier,

00:46:11.236 --> 00:46:14.086 A:middle
where we saw a Keychain item
being released from the KeyStore

00:46:14.086 --> 00:46:16.696 A:middle
in Secure Enclave, back
to your application.

00:46:17.166 --> 00:46:21.896 A:middle
This obviously is needed if you
take that password and use it

00:46:21.896 --> 00:46:22.656 A:middle
to log into a server,

00:46:22.736 --> 00:46:27.026 A:middle
but it exposes the password
it a potentially compromised

00:46:27.476 --> 00:46:28.806 A:middle
user space.

00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:30.776 A:middle
So wouldn't it be
great if there's a way

00:46:30.916 --> 00:46:33.636 A:middle
to keep the secret
inside Secure Enclave

00:46:33.906 --> 00:46:35.096 A:middle
but still have it be usable?

00:46:35.916 --> 00:46:38.126 A:middle
And there is, using
asymmetric cryptography.

00:46:39.486 --> 00:46:42.766 A:middle
There we don't just have a
single key, but a key pair.

00:46:43.606 --> 00:46:47.306 A:middle
A public key that doesn't
require any protection,

00:46:47.826 --> 00:46:53.906 A:middle
and a private key we
have to keep safe.

00:46:54.116 --> 00:46:58.656 A:middle
Using this requires the
SecKey API and the details

00:46:58.656 --> 00:47:00.336 A:middle
that are somewhat
beyond the scope



00:46:58.656 --> 00:47:00.336 A:middle
that are somewhat
beyond the scope

00:47:00.336 --> 00:47:03.106 A:middle
of the few minutes I have left,
but here is an overview just

00:47:03.106 --> 00:47:05.506 A:middle
so you can see the flow.

00:47:05.506 --> 00:47:09.436 A:middle
Calling SecKeyGeneratePair
will cause the private key

00:47:09.796 --> 00:47:11.946 A:middle
to be stored in Secure Enclave,

00:47:12.176 --> 00:47:14.576 A:middle
if you specify some new
additional parameters.

00:47:15.796 --> 00:47:18.366 A:middle
But the public key
is still returned

00:47:18.366 --> 00:47:19.676 A:middle
to your application to store.

00:47:23.716 --> 00:47:26.396 A:middle
If you try and retrieve
the private key,

00:47:26.676 --> 00:47:30.966 A:middle
using SecItemCopyMatching,
you can get a reference,

00:47:31.006 --> 00:47:35.216 A:middle
but cannot get the actual
data out of Secure Enclave.

00:47:35.766 --> 00:47:38.936 A:middle
So how do you actually use it?

00:47:39.736 --> 00:47:42.566 A:middle
Well, you might have some
data you want to be signed.

00:47:43.206 --> 00:47:47.736 A:middle
So you can call SecKeyRawSign
and pass the data

00:47:47.736 --> 00:47:52.016 A:middle
into Secure Enclave, and if
you've set up the private key

00:47:52.016 --> 00:47:53.826 A:middle
to be protected by Touch ID,

00:47:54.886 --> 00:47:59.246 A:middle
only after a successful match
will the private key be used

00:47:59.416 --> 00:48:02.936 A:middle
to sign that data, and have it
returned to your application.



00:47:59.416 --> 00:48:02.936 A:middle
to sign that data, and have it
returned to your application.

00:48:09.036 --> 00:48:10.626 A:middle
So one place you might want

00:48:10.626 --> 00:48:13.716 A:middle
to use this is strengthening
Touch ID as a second factor.

00:48:13.786 --> 00:48:18.246 A:middle
I'm going to give an example
flow, but bear in mind

00:48:18.246 --> 00:48:20.916 A:middle
that there are a lot
of intricate details

00:48:20.916 --> 00:48:22.656 A:middle
in writing cryptographic
protocol.

00:48:22.906 --> 00:48:24.746 A:middle
So please don't take this
to be too prescriptive.

00:48:25.156 --> 00:48:28.906 A:middle
First of all, for
the enrollment flow,

00:48:29.086 --> 00:48:33.946 A:middle
you would generate a key pair,
and send the public key back

00:48:33.946 --> 00:48:37.746 A:middle
to the server, along with a
user's regular login details.

00:48:39.656 --> 00:48:43.836 A:middle
The server would record the
public key as being associated

00:48:43.836 --> 00:48:47.206 A:middle
with that user, and
that's enrollment.

00:48:47.206 --> 00:48:52.316 A:middle
Later on, when the server wants
to verify that you're logging

00:48:52.316 --> 00:48:55.436 A:middle
in from the same physical
device that you were before,

00:48:55.836 --> 00:48:59.036 A:middle
it can send a challenge
to your application,

00:48:59.946 --> 00:49:02.336 A:middle
which in turn calls
SecKeyRawSign.



00:48:59.946 --> 00:49:02.336 A:middle
which in turn calls
SecKeyRawSign.

00:49:04.556 --> 00:49:06.716 A:middle
The user will present
their finger

00:49:07.156 --> 00:49:08.356 A:middle
and have a Touch ID match.

00:49:08.906 --> 00:49:12.596 A:middle
That will result in the
challenge being signed

00:49:12.656 --> 00:49:14.136 A:middle
and you can send it
back to the server.

00:49:14.736 --> 00:49:19.446 A:middle
And the server can then use the
public key it previously stored

00:49:19.996 --> 00:49:21.056 A:middle
to validate the signature.

00:49:21.576 --> 00:49:27.156 A:middle
Just a few more details
on this topic.

00:49:27.706 --> 00:49:30.466 A:middle
The supported keys are
Elliptic Curve P256,

00:49:31.726 --> 00:49:34.376 A:middle
the private key is not
extractible in any form,

00:49:34.376 --> 00:49:37.776 A:middle
even protected, and the
applications are RawSign

00:49:37.806 --> 00:49:38.566 A:middle
and RawVerify.

00:49:42.656 --> 00:49:46.616 A:middle
So in summary, I have given
an overview of the Keychain,

00:49:47.616 --> 00:49:50.666 A:middle
and some situations where
you might want to use it.

00:49:52.076 --> 00:49:53.966 A:middle
I talked about the
technologies we have

00:49:53.966 --> 00:49:56.626 A:middle
to avoid presenting the
user with password prompts.

00:49:57.096 --> 00:50:02.336 A:middle
Looked at the two Touch ID
APIs, Local Authentication



00:49:57.096 --> 00:50:02.336 A:middle
Looked at the two Touch ID
APIs, Local Authentication

00:50:02.736 --> 00:50:04.396 A:middle
and Keychain Access Controls.

00:50:04.916 --> 00:50:10.056 A:middle
And told you about some new
advanced features you can build

00:50:10.236 --> 00:50:13.536 A:middle
on top the new things we
added to those APIs iOS 9.

00:50:17.436 --> 00:50:22.966 A:middle
App passwords and Secure
Enclave protected private keys.

00:50:24.086 --> 00:50:27.076 A:middle
I'm always fascinated to find

00:50:27.076 --> 00:50:28.976 A:middle
out what wonderful
things you are going

00:50:28.976 --> 00:50:30.736 A:middle
to make using these new APIs

00:50:31.156 --> 00:50:34.856 A:middle
and how you can better balance
security and convenience

00:50:34.856 --> 00:50:36.106 A:middle
in your own applications.

00:50:38.856 --> 00:50:41.986 A:middle
There's some more
information available online,

00:50:42.206 --> 00:50:46.226 A:middle
including the iOS Security
White Paper I mentioned earlier.

00:50:46.226 --> 00:50:52.126 A:middle
There's more information
about app transport security

00:50:52.336 --> 00:50:55.196 A:middle
on Thursday's Networking
with NSURL Session, session.

00:50:55.856 --> 00:51:02.246 A:middle
And come and visit us tomorrow
morning and Thursday morning



00:50:55.856 --> 00:51:02.246 A:middle
And come and visit us tomorrow
morning and Thursday morning

00:51:02.656 --> 00:51:04.396 A:middle
in the Security and
Privacy labs.

00:51:05.106 --> 00:51:06.066 A:middle
Thank you very much, indeed.

00:51:07.516 --> 00:51:11.500 A:middle
[Applause]
