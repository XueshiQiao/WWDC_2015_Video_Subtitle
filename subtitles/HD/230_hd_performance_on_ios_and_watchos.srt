00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:31.156 A:middle
[Applause]

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:32.146 A:middle
&gt;&gt; BEN ENGLERT: Good morning.

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:35.146 A:middle
My name's Ben.

00:00:35.146 --> 00:00:38.126 A:middle
I am an iOS Performance
Engineer, and today we are going

00:00:38.126 --> 00:00:40.906 A:middle
to talk about "Performance
on iOS and watchOS."

00:00:41.746 --> 00:00:44.296 A:middle
So we are going to
start by telling you,

00:00:44.686 --> 00:00:46.156 A:middle
why should you think
about performance?

00:00:46.676 --> 00:00:48.146 A:middle
If you've never thought
about performance

00:00:48.146 --> 00:00:51.706 A:middle
in your app before,
why start now?

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:54.216 A:middle
Hopefully I'll convince
you to stay in your seats,

00:00:55.196 --> 00:00:56.516 A:middle
and then we can move on to,

00:00:56.646 --> 00:00:57.966 A:middle
how should you think
about performance?

00:00:58.536 --> 00:01:01.756 A:middle
It can be like a very broad
and sometimes daunting topic,



00:00:58.536 --> 00:01:01.756 A:middle
It can be like a very broad
and sometimes daunting topic,

00:01:01.756 --> 00:01:04.566 A:middle
but we are going to break it
down into a couple of categories

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:07.076 A:middle
and give you a few
specific strategies

00:01:07.146 --> 00:01:09.936 A:middle
for improving the performance
of your app in those areas.

00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.406 A:middle
And finally, you're
hopefully really excited

00:01:13.546 --> 00:01:16.646 A:middle
to bring native code to watchOS
2, and we are going to dig

00:01:16.646 --> 00:01:19.306 A:middle
into what you can do to get
the best user experience

00:01:19.426 --> 00:01:20.896 A:middle
in your app on that platform.

00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:24.426 A:middle
So why should you think
about performance?

00:01:25.246 --> 00:01:29.146 A:middle
The easiest way to sum it up is
that performance is a feature.

00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:31.786 A:middle
It's a core and central element

00:01:31.786 --> 00:01:34.596 A:middle
of giving your users a great
experience in your app.

00:01:35.236 --> 00:01:37.876 A:middle
It's not an extra or a bonus
or something you can get

00:01:37.876 --> 00:01:39.576 A:middle
to at the end if you have time.

00:01:40.506 --> 00:01:41.846 A:middle
It's actually something
that should be

00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:44.616 A:middle
on your mind all the time
while you are writing your app.

00:01:45.336 --> 00:01:46.466 A:middle
There's a couple of
reasons for that.

00:01:48.056 --> 00:01:49.706 A:middle
If your app is really
responsive,

00:01:49.936 --> 00:01:52.606 A:middle
if it always responds to
user input right away,

00:01:53.576 --> 00:01:55.886 A:middle
that actually builds
the trust of your users.

00:01:56.886 --> 00:02:00.516 A:middle
That lets them know that if they
quickly need to access a piece



00:01:56.886 --> 00:02:00.516 A:middle
That lets them know that if they
quickly need to access a piece

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:03.396 A:middle
of information or service
some interaction in your app,

00:02:03.646 --> 00:02:04.936 A:middle
it's not going to
keep them waiting,

00:02:05.536 --> 00:02:08.116 A:middle
and that makes them really happy
and keeps them coming back.

00:02:08.116 --> 00:02:13.586 A:middle
If you are going to adopt
Multitasking on iPad in iOS 9,

00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:17.316 A:middle
not only does your app no longer
have full run of the screen,

00:02:18.136 --> 00:02:19.536 A:middle
it actually doesn't
have full run

00:02:19.536 --> 00:02:21.246 A:middle
of the system's resources
either.

00:02:22.106 --> 00:02:25.726 A:middle
So a performance problem in your
app doesn't just cause a bad

00:02:25.726 --> 00:02:27.316 A:middle
experience in your app anymore;

00:02:27.656 --> 00:02:29.306 A:middle
it can actually cause
a bad experience

00:02:29.426 --> 00:02:30.636 A:middle
in another app as well.

00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:34.356 A:middle
You really want to be known as
a good neighbor in Multitasking.

00:02:34.906 --> 00:02:39.876 A:middle
Apps that are architected to be
efficient with system resources,

00:02:40.156 --> 00:02:42.926 A:middle
like CPU or memory,
don't just feel great

00:02:42.926 --> 00:02:45.726 A:middle
when you are using them; they
actually save battery power

00:02:45.796 --> 00:02:47.226 A:middle
and let your user get
through their day,

00:02:47.556 --> 00:02:48.746 A:middle
and they really appreciate that.

00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:53.826 A:middle
And finally, iOS 9 supports
a huge range of hardware,

00:02:54.326 --> 00:02:57.026 A:middle
and performance is a
prerequisite of continuing

00:02:57.026 --> 00:03:00.316 A:middle
to bring great apps and features
to all of your customers.



00:02:57.026 --> 00:03:00.316 A:middle
to bring great apps and features
to all of your customers.

00:03:03.576 --> 00:03:05.886 A:middle
So hopefully I have convinced
you, you don't have to walk out.

00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:08.956 A:middle
How should you think
about performance?

00:03:09.496 --> 00:03:11.216 A:middle
Well, the very first step

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:14.166 A:middle
when you are building your
app is choosing technologies.

00:03:15.076 --> 00:03:17.876 A:middle
This is critical because
you need to choose

00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:19.076 A:middle
which technologies are going

00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:22.286 A:middle
to give your users the best
experience in your app.

00:03:22.556 --> 00:03:25.376 A:middle
Once you are a little bit of
the way into building your app,

00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:27.786 A:middle
you can start taking
measurements

00:03:27.786 --> 00:03:30.626 A:middle
and actually understanding
what the user experience is

00:03:30.856 --> 00:03:33.806 A:middle
in the critical interactions
in your app.

00:03:34.076 --> 00:03:37.276 A:middle
Your measurements will inform
you how your app is doing today.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.446 A:middle
Once you've got those, you
can actually set some goals

00:03:40.676 --> 00:03:42.336 A:middle
for what state you
want your app to be

00:03:42.336 --> 00:03:43.946 A:middle
in before you submit
it to the Store.

00:03:45.066 --> 00:03:47.746 A:middle
And finally, once you've
got all that, you are ready

00:03:47.746 --> 00:03:50.496 A:middle
to start making code changes
to improve the performance

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:53.066 A:middle
in your app, and there's a
great workflow you can follow

00:03:53.296 --> 00:03:54.456 A:middle
to converge on your targets.

00:03:55.696 --> 00:03:57.956 A:middle
So let's start with
choosing technologies.

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:02.206 A:middle
Picking the right tool for
the job is a really early



00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:02.206 A:middle
Picking the right tool for
the job is a really early

00:04:02.206 --> 00:04:03.186 A:middle
and critical aspect

00:04:03.436 --> 00:04:06.456 A:middle
of proactively architecting
your app for great performance.

00:04:07.226 --> 00:04:09.946 A:middle
And the very first step of
choosing technologies is

00:04:09.996 --> 00:04:11.116 A:middle
to know the technologies.

00:04:11.656 --> 00:04:13.366 A:middle
So over the course of this talk,

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:16.166 A:middle
I'm going to reference several
other talks from this year

00:04:16.245 --> 00:04:19.046 A:middle
and previous years
that cover technologies

00:04:19.286 --> 00:04:20.745 A:middle
that we have found
really helpful

00:04:20.866 --> 00:04:23.956 A:middle
for getting great
performance in apps.

00:04:24.186 --> 00:04:27.206 A:middle
Once you know the universe of
technologies that are available

00:04:27.206 --> 00:04:30.106 A:middle
to you, then you can start
to bring in your knowledge

00:04:30.106 --> 00:04:32.246 A:middle
of how your app works
and what it needs to do,

00:04:33.446 --> 00:04:35.036 A:middle
and pick the best
ones for your app.

00:04:36.056 --> 00:04:38.726 A:middle
A great example here
is if your app needs

00:04:38.786 --> 00:04:42.556 A:middle
to store three strings, it's
probably okay to write those

00:04:42.556 --> 00:04:44.696 A:middle
out to a plist or put
them in user defaults.

00:04:45.476 --> 00:04:48.816 A:middle
On the other hand, if your app
needs to use 3,000 strings,

00:04:49.556 --> 00:04:51.556 A:middle
you might want to
consider Core Data.

00:04:52.176 --> 00:04:55.746 A:middle
Speaking of Core Data, when
you are choosing technologies,

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.316 A:middle
I strongly encourage you

00:04:57.316 --> 00:04:59.436 A:middle
to consider Apple
APIs and frameworks.



00:05:00.336 --> 00:05:03.016 A:middle
We spent a lot of time trying
to make those great for you

00:05:03.016 --> 00:05:07.436 A:middle
and your users, and we build
our own products on them.

00:05:07.646 --> 00:05:11.356 A:middle
One benefit of adopting
Apple APIs and frameworks is

00:05:11.356 --> 00:05:13.736 A:middle
that after the user
installs your app,

00:05:14.666 --> 00:05:16.376 A:middle
they might install
an iOS update,

00:05:16.876 --> 00:05:19.916 A:middle
and these frequently contain
performance improvements

00:05:19.966 --> 00:05:21.536 A:middle
to core APIs and technologies.

00:05:21.996 --> 00:05:23.826 A:middle
So the next time
they open your app

00:05:23.826 --> 00:05:27.016 A:middle
after installing an iOS
update, it magically got faster.

00:05:28.186 --> 00:05:29.696 A:middle
So you've chosen
some technologies,

00:05:29.836 --> 00:05:31.706 A:middle
and you've started
building your app.

00:05:32.816 --> 00:05:33.876 A:middle
Let's measure a few things.

00:05:34.676 --> 00:05:36.486 A:middle
There's a couple of
categories of performance

00:05:36.486 --> 00:05:37.626 A:middle
that we can think
about measuring.

00:05:38.936 --> 00:05:40.236 A:middle
Let's start with animations.

00:05:40.856 --> 00:05:43.756 A:middle
Animations are what make
your app feel alive and fluid

00:05:43.756 --> 00:05:46.706 A:middle
and let your user know where
they are and what's going on.

00:05:47.566 --> 00:05:49.416 A:middle
The easiest way to
measure the performance

00:05:49.416 --> 00:05:52.186 A:middle
of your animations is the
Core Animation instrument.

00:05:55.336 --> 00:05:59.326 A:middle
Responsiveness is all about how
quickly you react to user input,

00:05:59.876 --> 00:06:01.706 A:middle
and actually, the simplest way



00:05:59.876 --> 00:06:01.706 A:middle
and actually, the simplest way

00:06:01.706 --> 00:06:05.176 A:middle
of measuring responsiveness
may seem a little bit low tech,

00:06:05.596 --> 00:06:06.616 A:middle
but it's really powerful,

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:09.336 A:middle
and that is simply
instrumenting your actual code.

00:06:09.336 --> 00:06:11.186 A:middle
I am going to go into
an example of that.

00:06:12.676 --> 00:06:15.816 A:middle
For more complex scenarios that
maybe involve several threads

00:06:15.816 --> 00:06:17.246 A:middle
or lots of system interactions,

00:06:17.246 --> 00:06:19.526 A:middle
there is a great instrument
called System Trace.

00:06:21.176 --> 00:06:22.566 A:middle
And finally, memory.

00:06:23.426 --> 00:06:26.336 A:middle
Memory is the most precious
resource on mobile devices,

00:06:26.976 --> 00:06:27.996 A:middle
and it's really important

00:06:27.996 --> 00:06:30.836 A:middle
to make sure your app is
using exactly as much memory

00:06:30.836 --> 00:06:32.276 A:middle
as it needs and no more.

00:06:33.456 --> 00:06:35.866 A:middle
Again, a simple but powerful way

00:06:35.866 --> 00:06:37.726 A:middle
to understand your
app's memory use --

00:06:37.726 --> 00:06:40.206 A:middle
which I am going to go into
-- is the Xcode debugger.

00:06:41.356 --> 00:06:42.646 A:middle
When you are ready
to dig in more,

00:06:43.106 --> 00:06:44.886 A:middle
there's a great instrument
called Allocations.

00:06:45.636 --> 00:06:48.136 A:middle
And if you think you have
leaks, there's an instrument

00:06:48.136 --> 00:06:51.116 A:middle
to help you track
those down as well.

00:06:51.346 --> 00:06:55.616 A:middle
So let's go into a code
instrumentation example.

00:06:55.616 --> 00:06:58.856 A:middle
Here I've got an IBAction
that's wired to a button,

00:06:58.856 --> 00:07:01.926 A:middle
so when my user taps this,
I am going to load an image



00:06:58.856 --> 00:07:01.926 A:middle
so when my user taps this,
I am going to load an image

00:07:01.926 --> 00:07:02.756 A:middle
and put it in my view.

00:07:03.526 --> 00:07:04.976 A:middle
And I want to know
how long this takes.

00:07:05.136 --> 00:07:09.276 A:middle
So I am going to use an API
called 'CF absolute time

00:07:09.276 --> 00:07:09.786 A:middle
get current.'

00:07:10.746 --> 00:07:12.916 A:middle
Now, I don't actually care
about the absolute value

00:07:12.916 --> 00:07:14.706 A:middle
of the current time,
but I do care

00:07:14.706 --> 00:07:17.106 A:middle
about the difference
between these.

00:07:17.716 --> 00:07:21.206 A:middle
This API, although this is
Swift and it's type inference

00:07:21.206 --> 00:07:24.026 A:middle
and it's wonderful, I will
tell you this returns a double,

00:07:24.436 --> 00:07:27.266 A:middle
and specifically, that double
represents the current time

00:07:27.266 --> 00:07:27.856 A:middle
in seconds.

00:07:28.696 --> 00:07:30.906 A:middle
A second is actually
a really long time.

00:07:31.176 --> 00:07:33.196 A:middle
Your user is really going
to feel it if something

00:07:33.196 --> 00:07:34.386 A:middle
in your app takes a second.

00:07:35.286 --> 00:07:37.186 A:middle
So we actually find milliseconds

00:07:37.396 --> 00:07:39.336 A:middle
to be a more actionable
unit of measure here.

00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:42.336 A:middle
So we are going to subtract the
start time from the end time

00:07:42.336 --> 00:07:44.156 A:middle
and multiply the
result by a thousand

00:07:44.476 --> 00:07:46.346 A:middle
to get our measurement
in milliseconds.

00:07:48.826 --> 00:07:52.506 A:middle
It's important to profile
the release configuration

00:07:52.506 --> 00:07:55.926 A:middle
of your app so that you get
all the compiler optimizations

00:07:56.536 --> 00:07:57.716 A:middle
that your users will get and so

00:07:57.716 --> 00:07:59.836 A:middle
that you understand how your
app is actually behaving

00:07:59.836 --> 00:08:03.476 A:middle
in the field; however,
it's equally important not



00:07:59.836 --> 00:08:03.476 A:middle
in the field; however,
it's equally important not

00:08:03.476 --> 00:08:05.616 A:middle
to submit your performance
instrumentation

00:08:05.616 --> 00:08:06.306 A:middle
to the App Store.

00:08:06.976 --> 00:08:09.416 A:middle
So my suggestion is that
you actually create a copy

00:08:09.416 --> 00:08:13.966 A:middle
of your release scheme in Xcode
and define one additional define

00:08:14.236 --> 00:08:17.496 A:middle
so that you can build a
release version of your app

00:08:17.846 --> 00:08:20.206 A:middle
with the performance
instrumentation quickly

00:08:20.206 --> 00:08:20.716 A:middle
and easily.

00:08:21.886 --> 00:08:25.306 A:middle
So what types of responsiveness
are we interested in measuring?

00:08:25.766 --> 00:08:28.076 A:middle
Well, definitely taps
and button presses.

00:08:29.416 --> 00:08:32.635 A:middle
Most commonly, you'll be
doing these in IBActions.

00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:37.155 A:middle
You may also do them in
UIView touch handling code.

00:08:37.936 --> 00:08:39.996 A:middle
Or you may have a
gesture recognizer target.

00:08:40.356 --> 00:08:44.246 A:middle
Another aspect of your app's
performance that's interesting

00:08:44.246 --> 00:08:47.006 A:middle
to understand is what it
feels for the user to move

00:08:47.006 --> 00:08:49.046 A:middle
around in your app and
switch to different views,

00:08:49.516 --> 00:08:51.456 A:middle
whether that's using a
tab bar or modal views.

00:08:52.126 --> 00:08:55.526 A:middle
In this case, we find
it interesting to think

00:08:55.526 --> 00:08:57.266 A:middle
about the time between
'view will appear'

00:08:57.266 --> 00:08:59.776 A:middle
and 'view did appear'
because that lets you compare



00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:03.096 A:middle
which of your views take longer
to get ready to get on screen.

00:09:05.596 --> 00:09:07.546 A:middle
So you've taken some
measurements,

00:09:07.646 --> 00:09:09.396 A:middle
and you understand how
your app is behaving.

00:09:10.386 --> 00:09:12.346 A:middle
How do you set goals for
where you want your app

00:09:12.406 --> 00:09:14.116 A:middle
to be before you
submit it to the Store?

00:09:15.576 --> 00:09:18.896 A:middle
Animations feel great, they feel
realistic and fluid and alive

00:09:19.206 --> 00:09:20.976 A:middle
when they run at 60
frames per second.

00:09:22.146 --> 00:09:23.986 A:middle
I'm not going to talk too
much about them this year

00:09:24.436 --> 00:09:26.396 A:middle
because there's a great talk
from last year you can check

00:09:26.396 --> 00:09:29.386 A:middle
out called "Advanced Graphics
and Animations in iOS Apps,"

00:09:30.326 --> 00:09:33.026 A:middle
and there they cover the
Core Animation instrument

00:09:33.026 --> 00:09:34.906 A:middle
and how you can use it to
measure the performance

00:09:34.906 --> 00:09:36.826 A:middle
of your animations
and also improve it

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:38.196 A:middle
across the full range
of hardware.

00:09:39.506 --> 00:09:42.486 A:middle
We are going to spend a lot of
time today on responsiveness.

00:09:43.336 --> 00:09:45.896 A:middle
Responsiveness is
all about, again,

00:09:45.896 --> 00:09:47.506 A:middle
how you react to user input.

00:09:47.996 --> 00:09:50.566 A:middle
And we've found that if
it takes too much longer

00:09:50.566 --> 00:09:53.226 A:middle
than a hundred milliseconds,
your user starts to feel it.

00:09:53.636 --> 00:09:56.406 A:middle
So your goal for any
responsiveness scenario should

00:09:56.406 --> 00:09:57.726 A:middle
be 100 milliseconds.

00:09:58.756 --> 00:10:00.376 A:middle
By the way, you want to think



00:09:58.756 --> 00:10:00.376 A:middle
By the way, you want to think

00:10:00.376 --> 00:10:02.466 A:middle
about reaching these
performance goals

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:04.896 A:middle
on the oldest hardware
you intend to support.

00:10:05.486 --> 00:10:10.736 A:middle
If you are targeting iOS 9, that
might be the original iPad mini,

00:10:11.106 --> 00:10:13.416 A:middle
the iPhone 4s, or
even the iPad 2.

00:10:14.586 --> 00:10:15.826 A:middle
If you've already
got one of those --

00:10:15.826 --> 00:10:17.616 A:middle
or rather, if you've
still got one of those --

00:10:18.206 --> 00:10:21.646 A:middle
please keep it, continue to
use it, continue testing on it.

00:10:22.546 --> 00:10:25.756 A:middle
And if you don't, well, there's
a great refurbished section

00:10:25.936 --> 00:10:27.126 A:middle
on the Apple Online Store.

00:10:28.516 --> 00:10:30.936 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:10:31.436 --> 00:10:33.066 A:middle
So you've set goals.

00:10:33.426 --> 00:10:34.316 A:middle
You've taken measurements.

00:10:34.896 --> 00:10:37.746 A:middle
And now you want to proceed with
making code changes in your app

00:10:38.186 --> 00:10:39.356 A:middle
to improve the performance.

00:10:40.576 --> 00:10:41.176 A:middle
How do we start?

00:10:42.626 --> 00:10:43.916 A:middle
First of all, don't guess.

00:10:45.106 --> 00:10:48.676 A:middle
You really would like to profile
with tools and act on evidence

00:10:48.676 --> 00:10:51.216 A:middle
of what's causing the
performance issues in your app.

00:10:51.796 --> 00:10:54.746 A:middle
It's charming to think that your
intuition will be right all the

00:10:54.746 --> 00:10:58.666 A:middle
time, but it's probably
closer to a coin toss.

00:10:58.866 --> 00:11:02.016 A:middle
Along those lines, avoid
premature optimization.



00:10:58.866 --> 00:11:02.016 A:middle
Along those lines, avoid
premature optimization.

00:11:02.586 --> 00:11:05.506 A:middle
Don't complexify your code
until you have evidence

00:11:05.796 --> 00:11:08.936 A:middle
that the simplest possible
implementation is not sufficient

00:11:08.936 --> 00:11:09.776 A:middle
for great performance.

00:11:10.466 --> 00:11:13.456 A:middle
Frequently, the mechanisms
that people introduce to try

00:11:13.456 --> 00:11:16.596 A:middle
to proactively stave off
performance problems end

00:11:16.596 --> 00:11:20.836 A:middle
up causing performance
problems of their own.

00:11:20.926 --> 00:11:22.386 A:middle
Make one change at a time.

00:11:22.776 --> 00:11:28.006 A:middle
You do want to start to hone and
develop your intuition for how

00:11:28.006 --> 00:11:29.896 A:middle
to approach improving the
performance of your app,

00:11:30.486 --> 00:11:33.636 A:middle
and it's very hard to
understand which thing you did

00:11:33.906 --> 00:11:36.456 A:middle
that actually ended up improving
the performance of your app,

00:11:36.956 --> 00:11:38.596 A:middle
so make one change at a time.

00:11:39.316 --> 00:11:41.296 A:middle
And what I am really
trying to say here is

00:11:41.296 --> 00:11:42.526 A:middle
that there's no magic.

00:11:42.996 --> 00:11:44.686 A:middle
This is just like
ordinary debugging.

00:11:45.086 --> 00:11:48.406 A:middle
So bring the same rigorous,
scientific mindset you would

00:11:48.406 --> 00:11:51.296 A:middle
to debugging an app crash
or a functional issue.

00:11:51.866 --> 00:11:57.166 A:middle
So here is the picture
I want you to print out,

00:11:57.166 --> 00:12:00.016 A:middle
stick on your wall, set as
the wallpaper on your Mac.



00:11:57.166 --> 00:12:00.016 A:middle
stick on your wall, set as
the wallpaper on your Mac.

00:12:01.126 --> 00:12:03.556 A:middle
This is how we go through
making code changes

00:12:03.786 --> 00:12:04.906 A:middle
to improve performance
in an app.

00:12:05.816 --> 00:12:08.416 A:middle
The first thing you need to
do is reproduce the issue.

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:14.486 A:middle
Then profile with tools to get
an understanding of which areas

00:12:14.486 --> 00:12:15.976 A:middle
of your code are
actually contributing

00:12:15.976 --> 00:12:16.876 A:middle
to a performance issue.

00:12:17.616 --> 00:12:19.266 A:middle
In a sufficiently
large code base,

00:12:19.806 --> 00:12:22.266 A:middle
your intuition may actually
not be correct here,

00:12:22.376 --> 00:12:23.876 A:middle
so it's good to collect
evidence.

00:12:24.926 --> 00:12:28.186 A:middle
Then, once you've zoomed in on
the specific sections of code

00:12:28.466 --> 00:12:31.226 A:middle
that are causing
less-than-desirable performance

00:12:31.226 --> 00:12:34.226 A:middle
in your app, you can measure
exactly how much time you are

00:12:34.226 --> 00:12:34.786 A:middle
spending there.

00:12:35.476 --> 00:12:38.706 A:middle
And finally, you can make a
single targeted code change

00:12:38.926 --> 00:12:40.586 A:middle
to try and advance
towards your goals.

00:12:40.586 --> 00:12:46.286 A:middle
Often it's the case that one
single change doesn't get you

00:12:46.286 --> 00:12:48.706 A:middle
all the way to where you
want to be, and in fact,

00:12:49.056 --> 00:12:51.036 A:middle
several different
changes will combine

00:12:51.366 --> 00:12:52.996 A:middle
to eventually get
you to your goal.

00:12:53.706 --> 00:12:55.896 A:middle
So that's why this is a
cycle because you may find

00:12:56.136 --> 00:12:59.196 A:middle
that after you change code and
reproduce again, it's better,

00:12:59.196 --> 00:13:00.456 A:middle
but you are not where
you want to be.



00:12:59.196 --> 00:13:00.456 A:middle
but you are not where
you want to be.

00:13:01.256 --> 00:13:08.326 A:middle
So you can keep going through
the cycle until you are happy.

00:13:09.626 --> 00:13:13.536 A:middle
Profiling and measuring are on
that slide, and maybe they seem

00:13:13.536 --> 00:13:15.436 A:middle
like they are similar,
but actually,

00:13:15.436 --> 00:13:16.796 A:middle
they are two discrete steps

00:13:17.036 --> 00:13:18.466 A:middle
of improving the
performance of your app.

00:13:19.036 --> 00:13:22.636 A:middle
Profiling, again, is using
tools like the Xcode debugger

00:13:22.826 --> 00:13:25.546 A:middle
and Instruments: Time
Profiler to get an overview

00:13:25.626 --> 00:13:28.336 A:middle
of all the aspects of your
code that are contributing

00:13:28.336 --> 00:13:29.456 A:middle
to your performance scenario.

00:13:30.356 --> 00:13:34.086 A:middle
Measuring means instrumenting
a specific area of your code

00:13:34.086 --> 00:13:36.916 A:middle
to understand precisely how
much time the user spends

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:37.536 A:middle
waiting there.

00:13:38.126 --> 00:13:42.376 A:middle
And again, the 'CF absolute time
get current' example I gave is

00:13:42.376 --> 00:13:44.136 A:middle
actually a really
powerful way to do that.

00:13:45.096 --> 00:13:48.086 A:middle
Again, for more complex
scenarios, there's System Trace.

00:13:50.276 --> 00:13:52.086 A:middle
So let's talk about
responsiveness.

00:13:56.996 --> 00:14:00.206 A:middle
Responsiveness is all about
reacting to user input.



00:13:56.996 --> 00:14:00.206 A:middle
Responsiveness is all about
reacting to user input.

00:14:00.836 --> 00:14:03.266 A:middle
And we can't talk about
responsiveness without talking

00:14:03.266 --> 00:14:04.906 A:middle
about your app's main thread

00:14:05.396 --> 00:14:06.736 A:middle
because your app's
main thread is

00:14:06.736 --> 00:14:08.526 A:middle
where you consume
all the user input.

00:14:09.026 --> 00:14:10.906 A:middle
That's anything from
the touchscreen --

00:14:10.906 --> 00:14:14.226 A:middle
a tap or a scroll -- anything
from the other sensors

00:14:14.226 --> 00:14:16.026 A:middle
on the device, like
an orientation change,

00:14:16.736 --> 00:14:20.306 A:middle
and multitasking resizes and
other system state events.

00:14:21.686 --> 00:14:24.336 A:middle
If your main thread is
mostly dedicated to the task

00:14:24.456 --> 00:14:25.766 A:middle
of responding to user input,

00:14:26.236 --> 00:14:28.416 A:middle
your app will feel
really great all the time.

00:14:29.756 --> 00:14:31.726 A:middle
If you're a little less
careful with what you do

00:14:31.726 --> 00:14:33.666 A:middle
on your main thread or
maybe you do everything

00:14:33.666 --> 00:14:34.446 A:middle
on your main thread,

00:14:34.996 --> 00:14:37.746 A:middle
it's possible your app
will appear hung or frozen.

00:14:38.346 --> 00:14:43.226 A:middle
So what should we avoid
doing on our main thread?

00:14:44.376 --> 00:14:47.826 A:middle
Specific things to watch out
for include CPU-intensive work.

00:14:48.496 --> 00:14:51.256 A:middle
That can mean parsing a long
string that you downloaded

00:14:51.256 --> 00:14:54.126 A:middle
from the network, maybe
applying a filter to an image,

00:14:54.696 --> 00:14:57.146 A:middle
and tasks that depend
on an external resource.

00:14:57.146 --> 00:14:58.296 A:middle
And I will come back to that.

00:14:58.946 --> 00:15:02.106 A:middle
I am not going to spend too much
time on CPU-intensive work today



00:14:58.946 --> 00:15:02.106 A:middle
I am not going to spend too much
time on CPU-intensive work today

00:15:02.106 --> 00:15:04.746 A:middle
because there was a great talk
earlier this week from the folks

00:15:04.796 --> 00:15:07.316 A:middle
that made Instruments
called "Profiling in Depth,"

00:15:08.036 --> 00:15:10.516 A:middle
and they actually talk about
improving the performance

00:15:10.516 --> 00:15:14.256 A:middle
of CPU-intensive code in
Instruments using Instruments.

00:15:14.726 --> 00:15:15.186 A:middle
It's awesome.

00:15:16.736 --> 00:15:19.756 A:middle
So let's go back to tasks that
depend on an external resource.

00:15:20.136 --> 00:15:22.556 A:middle
Another name for these
is a blocking call.

00:15:23.356 --> 00:15:25.036 A:middle
It's called that because
it prevents your thread

00:15:25.036 --> 00:15:26.686 A:middle
from making progress,
so you are blocked.

00:15:27.666 --> 00:15:28.586 A:middle
Now, what's a blocking call?

00:15:29.416 --> 00:15:31.906 A:middle
Some of you may be familiar
with the concept of a syscall.

00:15:33.246 --> 00:15:34.456 A:middle
Any code path that ends

00:15:34.456 --> 00:15:37.016 A:middle
up making a syscall is
considered a blocking call.

00:15:37.536 --> 00:15:41.926 A:middle
As I mentioned, these
typically involve resources

00:15:41.966 --> 00:15:44.966 A:middle
that are not currently in
memory, commonly things

00:15:44.966 --> 00:15:46.746 A:middle
like loading things
from the disk

00:15:46.966 --> 00:15:48.616 A:middle
or fetching stuff
over the network.

00:15:49.966 --> 00:15:52.236 A:middle
Occasionally, your main
thread will also get blocked

00:15:52.896 --> 00:15:55.146 A:middle
because it's waiting for a
resource that is available,

00:15:55.766 --> 00:15:57.666 A:middle
but it's waiting for
someone else to finish using

00:15:57.666 --> 00:16:00.476 A:middle
that resource because that
resource only allows one client



00:15:57.666 --> 00:16:00.476 A:middle
that resource because that
resource only allows one client

00:16:00.476 --> 00:16:04.016 A:middle
at a time.

00:16:04.186 --> 00:16:06.346 A:middle
So, how do you spot blocking
calls in your thread?

00:16:06.856 --> 00:16:08.406 A:middle
Well, sometimes they
jump right out at you.

00:16:09.336 --> 00:16:11.756 A:middle
The word "synchronous" is
a synonym for blocking.

00:16:12.506 --> 00:16:13.336 A:middle
So that's a clue.

00:16:13.336 --> 00:16:15.266 A:middle
When you are reading through
your code, that should light

00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:16.286 A:middle
up and draw your eyes.

00:16:17.416 --> 00:16:19.536 A:middle
So, great, we spotted this
blocking call in my code,

00:16:19.536 --> 00:16:21.836 A:middle
'NSURLConnection send
synchronous request.'

00:16:21.916 --> 00:16:23.856 A:middle
Well, what do I do now?

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:27.926 A:middle
Well, sometimes there is
an asynchronous API --

00:16:28.096 --> 00:16:30.296 A:middle
especially for APIs
that specifically call

00:16:30.296 --> 00:16:31.746 A:middle
out that they're
synchronous in their name --

00:16:32.436 --> 00:16:33.876 A:middle
that you can easily
switch over to.

00:16:34.516 --> 00:16:37.436 A:middle
In this case, we got
lucky, and in fact,

00:16:37.436 --> 00:16:39.936 A:middle
this one helpfully has the word
"asynchronous" in the name,

00:16:40.386 --> 00:16:42.356 A:middle
so we know exactly what we
are getting ourselves into.

00:16:43.536 --> 00:16:46.166 A:middle
Unfortunately, it's not quite
as simple as search and replace.

00:16:46.706 --> 00:16:49.566 A:middle
You are changing the order
that your code executes in,

00:16:49.826 --> 00:16:51.576 A:middle
and you may have other
code that depends

00:16:51.576 --> 00:16:53.016 A:middle
on the result of this operation.

00:16:53.556 --> 00:16:56.386 A:middle
So unfortunately, some
restructuring is required.

00:16:58.216 --> 00:17:01.846 A:middle
But let's say you don't
have an async equivalent



00:16:58.216 --> 00:17:01.846 A:middle
But let's say you don't
have an async equivalent

00:17:01.846 --> 00:17:05.516 A:middle
that you can easily switch to or
you want to move a whole section

00:17:05.516 --> 00:17:07.736 A:middle
of code off the main
thread in one operation.

00:17:08.516 --> 00:17:10.996 A:middle
In that case, use
Grand Central Dispatch.

00:17:12.386 --> 00:17:14.496 A:middle
Grand Central Dispatch
is an Apple technology

00:17:15.006 --> 00:17:17.435 A:middle
that manages a global
thread pool in your app.

00:17:17.606 --> 00:17:18.296 A:middle
It's already there.

00:17:18.566 --> 00:17:20.066 A:middle
Even if you don't notice it.

00:17:20.636 --> 00:17:22.846 A:middle
If you are familiar with
programming with threads

00:17:22.846 --> 00:17:26.425 A:middle
on other platforms, Grand
Central Dispatch sort of takes

00:17:26.425 --> 00:17:29.016 A:middle
out all the confusion
and trouble of worrying

00:17:29.016 --> 00:17:31.466 A:middle
about starting threads and what
state they are in and so on,

00:17:32.166 --> 00:17:34.246 A:middle
and lets you express tasks
that you'd like to run

00:17:34.246 --> 00:17:36.286 A:middle
as closures or blocks.

00:17:37.316 --> 00:17:40.176 A:middle
These closures, once you submit
them to Grand Central Dispatch,

00:17:40.616 --> 00:17:48.826 A:middle
run on an arbitrary
thread in your process.

00:17:48.946 --> 00:17:51.386 A:middle
Arbitrary threads are awesome
because you didn't have to deal

00:17:51.386 --> 00:17:52.566 A:middle
with starting them, and
you don't have to think

00:17:52.566 --> 00:17:55.146 A:middle
about how many there are,
but they have the caveat.

00:17:55.546 --> 00:17:58.896 A:middle
Since you don't control which
thread your code is running on,

00:17:59.606 --> 00:18:01.786 A:middle
any operation you
express in a closure



00:17:59.606 --> 00:18:01.786 A:middle
any operation you
express in a closure

00:18:01.786 --> 00:18:04.686 A:middle
or block must be safe
to do on any thread.

00:18:05.276 --> 00:18:08.106 A:middle
What are some examples?

00:18:08.106 --> 00:18:12.306 A:middle
Well, some objects are
actually restricted to access

00:18:12.306 --> 00:18:13.356 A:middle
on the main thread only.

00:18:13.876 --> 00:18:17.936 A:middle
UIKit views and controllers,
for example, must be created,

00:18:17.936 --> 00:18:21.166 A:middle
modified, and destroyed
only on the main thread.

00:18:22.506 --> 00:18:25.356 A:middle
Some objects, like Foundation
and Core Graphics objects,

00:18:25.846 --> 00:18:27.536 A:middle
allow use from any thread.

00:18:28.466 --> 00:18:31.256 A:middle
However, many of these have
the additional stipulation

00:18:31.576 --> 00:18:33.156 A:middle
that the caller is responsible

00:18:33.156 --> 00:18:37.426 A:middle
for ensuring only one thread
accesses them at the time.

00:18:38.106 --> 00:18:39.926 A:middle
They don't protect
themselves internally.

00:18:40.406 --> 00:18:42.666 A:middle
So if you intend to use
them for multiple threads,

00:18:43.016 --> 00:18:45.666 A:middle
you frequently have to implement
the protection yourself,

00:18:46.016 --> 00:18:49.086 A:middle
and the preferred way of doing
this is a serial GCD queue.

00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:52.646 A:middle
The best way to find out
how your objects expect

00:18:52.646 --> 00:18:54.586 A:middle
to be treated is to
read the headers.

00:18:54.916 --> 00:18:56.866 A:middle
Per object, usually
near the initializer,

00:18:57.096 --> 00:18:59.666 A:middle
there should be a description
of exactly how it expects

00:18:59.666 --> 00:19:01.246 A:middle
to be accessed by
threads in your app.



00:18:59.666 --> 00:19:01.246 A:middle
to be accessed by
threads in your app.

00:19:01.986 --> 00:19:03.416 A:middle
So, let's go back
to my example here.

00:19:04.366 --> 00:19:05.516 A:middle
What do I do in this code?

00:19:05.516 --> 00:19:07.116 A:middle
I load some data from a file.

00:19:08.416 --> 00:19:09.796 A:middle
I process and filter an image.

00:19:10.806 --> 00:19:13.626 A:middle
And finally, I put it in image
view in my view hierarchy.

00:19:14.666 --> 00:19:17.426 A:middle
So right now when the user
taps a button in my app,

00:19:18.426 --> 00:19:19.866 A:middle
my main thread looks a
little bit like this.

00:19:20.376 --> 00:19:23.456 A:middle
It does those three things
in order one after another.

00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:27.496 A:middle
Simple, straightforward,
easy to understand, great.

00:19:28.846 --> 00:19:32.366 A:middle
Unfortunately, should the
user happen to try and scroll

00:19:32.366 --> 00:19:34.796 A:middle
or rotate right when I am
in the middle of doing this,

00:19:35.896 --> 00:19:40.956 A:middle
we won't be able to service
that input until later.

00:19:42.326 --> 00:19:45.196 A:middle
And the thing with blocking
calls is you never really know

00:19:45.196 --> 00:19:46.086 A:middle
how long they are going to take.

00:19:46.086 --> 00:19:46.926 A:middle
It's sort of like the weather.

00:19:47.596 --> 00:19:50.886 A:middle
So the user is going to be kept
waiting for some unknown amount

00:19:50.886 --> 00:19:52.796 A:middle
of time, and that
will make them sad.

00:19:54.116 --> 00:19:54.876 A:middle
So how do we fix this?

00:19:55.876 --> 00:19:58.066 A:middle
Well, we can use Grand
Central Dispatch,

00:19:58.396 --> 00:20:01.026 A:middle
and we can use a Grand
Central Dispatch API called



00:19:58.396 --> 00:20:01.026 A:middle
and we can use a Grand
Central Dispatch API called

00:20:01.026 --> 00:20:01.836 A:middle
'dispatch async.'

00:20:02.686 --> 00:20:04.736 A:middle
Now, 'dispatch async'
takes two arguments.

00:20:05.886 --> 00:20:08.066 A:middle
The first thing you
need to pass in is

00:20:08.066 --> 00:20:10.096 A:middle
which queue you want it to use.

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:13.126 A:middle
As I mentioned, there's already
several queues in your app

00:20:13.766 --> 00:20:15.146 A:middle
that GCD has created for you.

00:20:15.146 --> 00:20:16.546 A:middle
And I am going to get one

00:20:16.546 --> 00:20:19.056 A:middle
of them using the 'dispatch
get global queue' API.

00:20:20.406 --> 00:20:23.066 A:middle
Because there are several,
I have to actually tell GCD

00:20:23.296 --> 00:20:25.466 A:middle
which one I want,
and here I am going

00:20:25.466 --> 00:20:27.356 A:middle
to use a 'Quality
of Service' class.

00:20:28.206 --> 00:20:31.276 A:middle
'Quality of Service' is how you
tell the system how important

00:20:31.276 --> 00:20:34.166 A:middle
the work you are asking it to do
is relative to both other work

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:36.466 A:middle
on your app and work across
the rest of the system.

00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:39.766 A:middle
In this case, because
this is the direct result

00:20:39.766 --> 00:20:43.406 A:middle
of a user action and the user is
probably waiting for the result,

00:20:43.406 --> 00:20:48.436 A:middle
I am going to use the
'user-initiated' QOS class.

00:20:48.606 --> 00:20:52.646 A:middle
The final argument to 'dispatch
async' is a closure containing

00:20:52.646 --> 00:20:55.496 A:middle
the code you would
like it to run.

00:20:55.646 --> 00:20:56.516 A:middle
So, great.

00:20:56.516 --> 00:20:57.126 A:middle
I am done.

00:20:57.426 --> 00:20:58.276 A:middle
It's off the main thread.

00:20:58.476 --> 00:21:00.986 A:middle
Right? Not quite.



00:20:58.476 --> 00:21:00.986 A:middle
Right? Not quite.

00:21:01.906 --> 00:21:05.236 A:middle
As I mentioned, UIKit views
and controllers are only safe

00:21:05.286 --> 00:21:09.906 A:middle
for use on the main thread, so I
can't put them in this closure.

00:21:10.086 --> 00:21:12.456 A:middle
So that wasn't really the
particularly slow part

00:21:12.456 --> 00:21:13.536 A:middle
of my code anyway, right?

00:21:13.576 --> 00:21:15.256 A:middle
The first two lines
were the blocking calls.

00:21:16.156 --> 00:21:19.856 A:middle
Why don't I just move this
back out onto the main thread?

00:21:20.056 --> 00:21:22.116 A:middle
Unfortunately, that's not
quite going to work either

00:21:22.446 --> 00:21:24.116 A:middle
because I have actually
changed the order

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:25.446 A:middle
that this code executes in.

00:21:26.456 --> 00:21:28.746 A:middle
This closure is not
guaranteed to have run

00:21:29.046 --> 00:21:30.986 A:middle
by the time 'dispatch
async' returns.

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:33.766 A:middle
Hopefully it will run
quite shortly afterwards.

00:21:34.486 --> 00:21:37.996 A:middle
But most likely, once GCD
has fired the work off

00:21:37.996 --> 00:21:40.166 A:middle
to the dispatch queue,
it will immediately move

00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:42.286 A:middle
on to the next line,
and at this point,

00:21:42.926 --> 00:21:44.496 A:middle
my image is still
likely to be nil.

00:21:45.086 --> 00:21:46.426 A:middle
The user will never
see their image.

00:21:47.076 --> 00:21:48.946 A:middle
That will also make them sad.

00:21:49.596 --> 00:21:50.806 A:middle
So how do we fix this?

00:21:51.776 --> 00:21:54.356 A:middle
Well, we can actually make
another call to 'dispatch async,

00:21:54.976 --> 00:21:57.926 A:middle
and this time we'll use a
very special queue called the

00:21:57.926 --> 00:21:58.586 A:middle
main queue.

00:21:59.086 --> 00:22:02.326 A:middle
The main queue is guaranteed to
be serviced by the main thread.



00:21:59.086 --> 00:22:02.326 A:middle
The main queue is guaranteed to
be serviced by the main thread.

00:22:02.756 --> 00:22:06.146 A:middle
You can get it using the API
dispatch 'get main queue.'

00:22:07.226 --> 00:22:10.766 A:middle
What that means is if you have
objects that require access

00:22:10.766 --> 00:22:13.296 A:middle
on the main thread, you can
still put them in a closure

00:22:13.296 --> 00:22:14.346 A:middle
and pass it to dispatch.

00:22:14.746 --> 00:22:16.336 A:middle
You just have to make sure
they run on this queue.

00:22:16.336 --> 00:22:20.296 A:middle
So I have done that here and now
my imageView is safe and happy.

00:22:21.686 --> 00:22:24.766 A:middle
With this, we've moved that
work off the main thread,

00:22:25.386 --> 00:22:27.176 A:middle
but then when we've
needed to use objects

00:22:27.216 --> 00:22:29.486 A:middle
that must be accessed on the
main thread, we have done

00:22:29.486 --> 00:22:31.356 A:middle
so once the data
is ready for them.

00:22:32.426 --> 00:22:35.136 A:middle
And by the way, the original
problem we were trying to solve,

00:22:35.866 --> 00:22:37.616 A:middle
should the user try
and scroll or rotate,

00:22:37.616 --> 00:22:40.556 A:middle
that will get serviced right
away, and they will be happy.

00:22:41.436 --> 00:22:42.616 A:middle
Thank you.

00:22:43.516 --> 00:22:46.856 A:middle
[Applause]

00:22:47.356 --> 00:22:49.746 A:middle
So what types of blocking
calls are you likely

00:22:49.746 --> 00:22:50.596 A:middle
to find in your code?

00:22:50.776 --> 00:22:52.876 A:middle
They are sneaky and they
hide in all kinds of places.

00:22:53.436 --> 00:22:55.896 A:middle
As I mentioned, networking.

00:22:56.186 --> 00:22:57.766 A:middle
NSURLConnection and friends.

00:22:57.766 --> 00:23:00.426 A:middle
It's very easy to,
without meaning to,



00:22:57.766 --> 00:23:00.426 A:middle
It's very easy to,
without meaning to,

00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:02.446 A:middle
make a synchronous
call to the network.

00:23:03.506 --> 00:23:05.756 A:middle
Usually you can switch
to asynchronous API,

00:23:06.856 --> 00:23:09.416 A:middle
or if you actually
want even more control

00:23:09.666 --> 00:23:11.626 A:middle
over when your application
accesses the network --

00:23:12.436 --> 00:23:14.376 A:middle
and in some cases even
let it download things

00:23:14.376 --> 00:23:15.096 A:middle
when it's not running --

00:23:15.596 --> 00:23:18.806 A:middle
I encourage you to check out the
NSURLSession background session.

00:23:20.316 --> 00:23:21.786 A:middle
Foundation initializers.

00:23:21.906 --> 00:23:23.476 A:middle
When you come across
these in your code,

00:23:23.956 --> 00:23:25.056 A:middle
they don't look that scary.

00:23:25.196 --> 00:23:25.876 A:middle
It's one line.

00:23:26.136 --> 00:23:26.926 A:middle
How bad can it be?

00:23:27.606 --> 00:23:29.006 A:middle
But actually, some of these,

00:23:29.256 --> 00:23:32.896 A:middle
like ones with the name
'contents of file' or 'contents

00:23:32.896 --> 00:23:36.636 A:middle
of URL,' may end up having to
use the disk or other resources

00:23:36.696 --> 00:23:37.676 A:middle
to service your request.

00:23:39.076 --> 00:23:40.826 A:middle
And finally, Core Data.

00:23:41.536 --> 00:23:44.696 A:middle
Again, they just look like
objects, not bad, right?

00:23:45.416 --> 00:23:48.206 A:middle
Core Data frequently does a
lot of I/O on your behalf.

00:23:49.366 --> 00:23:51.446 A:middle
Luckily, it's pretty
easy to move some

00:23:51.446 --> 00:23:53.126 A:middle
of your heavy recorded
operations

00:23:53.346 --> 00:23:54.796 A:middle
to different concurrency modes.

00:23:55.336 --> 00:23:57.996 A:middle
And actually, there's great
new API in Core Data this year

00:23:58.246 --> 00:24:01.406 A:middle
to simplify that and other
common bulk operations.



00:23:58.246 --> 00:24:01.406 A:middle
to simplify that and other
common bulk operations.

00:24:02.066 --> 00:24:04.086 A:middle
You can go learn about it in
the session from the other day,

00:24:04.446 --> 00:24:05.396 A:middle
"What's New in Core Data."

00:24:06.376 --> 00:24:08.466 A:middle
So if you find a blocking call,

00:24:08.986 --> 00:24:11.626 A:middle
switch to asynchronous
API or use GCD.

00:24:11.626 --> 00:24:15.156 A:middle
If you want to know more
about GCD, including, again,

00:24:15.156 --> 00:24:18.266 A:middle
new API this year that's going
to simplify common operations

00:24:18.736 --> 00:24:20.596 A:middle
and also the quality
of service classes

00:24:20.596 --> 00:24:22.966 A:middle
that I mentioned earlier,
there's a great talk

00:24:22.966 --> 00:24:25.476 A:middle
from just an hour ago
called "Building Responsive

00:24:25.476 --> 00:24:26.606 A:middle
and Efficient Apps with GCD,"

00:24:26.606 --> 00:24:29.066 A:middle
and I encourage you
to go watch it.

00:24:31.956 --> 00:24:34.316 A:middle
Let's move on to memory.

00:24:35.426 --> 00:24:38.296 A:middle
Like I said, memory is
the most precious resource

00:24:38.586 --> 00:24:39.386 A:middle
on mobile devices.

00:24:39.386 --> 00:24:45.016 A:middle
If you are planning to adopt
multitasking in your app, again,

00:24:45.956 --> 00:24:48.816 A:middle
you don't have full run of the
screen anymore, so it stands

00:24:48.816 --> 00:24:51.286 A:middle
to reason that you also don't
have full run of the rest

00:24:51.286 --> 00:24:52.516 A:middle
of the system's resources.

00:24:52.976 --> 00:24:56.506 A:middle
If you are going to bring
some of the code from your app

00:24:56.506 --> 00:24:58.636 A:middle
to watchOS, it's
especially important

00:24:58.636 --> 00:25:02.266 A:middle
that its memory footprint
be compact.



00:24:58.636 --> 00:25:02.266 A:middle
that its memory footprint
be compact.

00:25:02.346 --> 00:25:05.236 A:middle
Once again, iOS 9 supports
a huge range of hardware.

00:25:05.856 --> 00:25:08.816 A:middle
If you want to bring your
great apps and features to some

00:25:08.816 --> 00:25:10.826 A:middle
of the lower-end devices
supported by the OS,

00:25:11.506 --> 00:25:13.666 A:middle
memory is extremely
important on those systems.

00:25:14.486 --> 00:25:17.086 A:middle
And finally, if you are the
developer of an extension,

00:25:17.646 --> 00:25:20.046 A:middle
think about the fact that your
extension may now be called

00:25:20.046 --> 00:25:23.226 A:middle
on to run when there are two
other apps on the screen.

00:25:24.186 --> 00:25:26.836 A:middle
So memory will be in high
demand, and you need to be able

00:25:26.836 --> 00:25:29.176 A:middle
to get away with using
as little as possible.

00:25:29.566 --> 00:25:34.046 A:middle
So let's get a little bit
into how memory works on iOS.

00:25:35.036 --> 00:25:36.016 A:middle
Ground rules.

00:25:36.476 --> 00:25:39.456 A:middle
There is not enough physical
memory on any iOS device

00:25:39.736 --> 00:25:43.446 A:middle
to keep all the suspended
apps in RAM at the same time.

00:25:44.636 --> 00:25:47.306 A:middle
When we come under memory
pressure, we actually have

00:25:47.366 --> 00:25:50.486 A:middle
to evict things to make
room for the foreground app.

00:25:51.476 --> 00:25:55.256 A:middle
On OS X or a PC operating
system, we might write the state

00:25:55.256 --> 00:25:57.826 A:middle
of those apps out to
disk first, but it turns

00:25:57.826 --> 00:26:00.086 A:middle
out that doesn't make
sense on mobile devices,



00:25:57.826 --> 00:26:00.086 A:middle
out that doesn't make
sense on mobile devices,

00:26:00.586 --> 00:26:04.536 A:middle
so when you get evicted,
you are just gone.

00:26:04.756 --> 00:26:06.886 A:middle
There's lots more detail
here and lots to get into,

00:26:07.446 --> 00:26:10.646 A:middle
and there's actually a great
talk from a few years ago called

00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:12.176 A:middle
"iOS App Performance Memory."

00:26:13.036 --> 00:26:15.106 A:middle
The slide template and colors
are a little different,

00:26:15.106 --> 00:26:19.256 A:middle
but the information is really
solid, so please go watch

00:26:19.256 --> 00:26:20.066 A:middle
that one if you are interested

00:26:20.066 --> 00:26:21.156 A:middle
to learn more about
how this works.

00:26:22.466 --> 00:26:24.786 A:middle
But if you've never thought
about memory in your app before,

00:26:25.196 --> 00:26:28.696 A:middle
it boils down to this --
reclaiming memory takes time.

00:26:29.186 --> 00:26:31.496 A:middle
If you've already used up
all the available memory

00:26:31.496 --> 00:26:33.446 A:middle
in the system and then
you need some more,

00:26:33.876 --> 00:26:36.306 A:middle
you might be kept waiting
while the system evicts things

00:26:36.306 --> 00:26:36.916 A:middle
on your behalf.

00:26:37.936 --> 00:26:40.216 A:middle
If you suddenly request
a large amount of memory,

00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:42.976 A:middle
the system might need to
evict several different things

00:26:43.026 --> 00:26:43.946 A:middle
to service your request,

00:26:44.366 --> 00:26:47.346 A:middle
and that can influence the
responsiveness of your app.

00:26:48.636 --> 00:26:50.866 A:middle
Conversely, when you
are in the background,

00:26:51.536 --> 00:26:53.196 A:middle
if your footprint
is very compact,

00:26:53.696 --> 00:26:55.556 A:middle
it's actually less likely
that you will be one

00:26:55.556 --> 00:26:56.916 A:middle
of the things that gets evicted.

00:26:57.426 --> 00:26:59.336 A:middle
And so when the user
then returns to your app,

00:26:59.726 --> 00:27:02.076 A:middle
you will be able to resume
instead of launching,



00:26:59.726 --> 00:27:02.076 A:middle
you will be able to resume
instead of launching,

00:27:02.076 --> 00:27:05.286 A:middle
and that will feel a lot faster.

00:27:05.476 --> 00:27:07.516 A:middle
So if you've never thought
about memory before,

00:27:08.326 --> 00:27:09.946 A:middle
it's really important
as a first step

00:27:10.076 --> 00:27:11.946 A:middle
to rationalize your
app's memory footprint.

00:27:12.586 --> 00:27:14.746 A:middle
And what that means is
to think about the types

00:27:14.746 --> 00:27:16.166 A:middle
of resources that it uses.

00:27:17.056 --> 00:27:20.866 A:middle
These might be strings; maybe
long blobs of JSON or XML

00:27:20.866 --> 00:27:24.036 A:middle
that you downloaded from the
network; images that, again,

00:27:24.036 --> 00:27:26.376 A:middle
came from the network or the
user took them with the camera;

00:27:27.086 --> 00:27:29.976 A:middle
and again, Core Data managed
objects, which use a lot

00:27:29.976 --> 00:27:34.206 A:middle
of underlying resources to
sort of make the magic happen.

00:27:34.396 --> 00:27:36.816 A:middle
Once you've thought about
these resources, you can start

00:27:36.816 --> 00:27:40.206 A:middle
to group them according to
which user interactions depend

00:27:40.206 --> 00:27:43.476 A:middle
on each kind, and that helps
you establish a mental model

00:27:43.476 --> 00:27:45.146 A:middle
of the resources
that your app uses.

00:27:46.366 --> 00:27:47.066 A:middle
Once you've done that,

00:27:47.546 --> 00:27:50.086 A:middle
we can quickly check our work
using the Xcode debugger.

00:27:51.526 --> 00:27:54.416 A:middle
To get into more detail, we
would reach for the Allocations

00:27:54.416 --> 00:27:55.466 A:middle
and Leaks Instruments.

00:27:55.576 --> 00:27:58.466 A:middle
I am not going to go into
those today, but please check

00:27:58.466 --> 00:28:00.496 A:middle
out this talk from last year
called "Improving Your App



00:27:58.466 --> 00:28:00.496 A:middle
out this talk from last year
called "Improving Your App

00:28:00.496 --> 00:28:03.526 A:middle
with Instruments" to
get started with those.

00:28:03.736 --> 00:28:05.546 A:middle
So let's go back to
the Xcode debugger.

00:28:05.546 --> 00:28:09.046 A:middle
I have downloaded the
Photos framework example app

00:28:09.216 --> 00:28:10.536 A:middle
from the Apple Developer
website.

00:28:11.276 --> 00:28:13.306 A:middle
I've plugged in my phone,
opened the Xcode project,

00:28:13.676 --> 00:28:14.466 A:middle
and hit build and run.

00:28:15.266 --> 00:28:16.886 A:middle
And now I am just going
to look at the top left

00:28:16.886 --> 00:28:18.916 A:middle
of my Xcode window
at the debugger.

00:28:19.476 --> 00:28:20.106 A:middle
Zoom in on that.

00:28:21.506 --> 00:28:23.246 A:middle
So, here, right away I can see

00:28:23.486 --> 00:28:26.106 A:middle
without touching my phone the
first number that's interesting

00:28:26.106 --> 00:28:26.316 A:middle
to me.

00:28:27.356 --> 00:28:29.576 A:middle
Now I know that right
after my app launches,

00:28:29.616 --> 00:28:31.046 A:middle
before the user does anything,

00:28:31.386 --> 00:28:33.966 A:middle
I am using about 10
megabytes of memory.

00:28:35.636 --> 00:28:39.406 A:middle
The next data point that I want
to collect is that I want to go

00:28:39.406 --> 00:28:42.396 A:middle
and do whatever the most common
user interaction in my app is,

00:28:42.866 --> 00:28:45.516 A:middle
so because this is a Photos
app, I am going to open a photo.

00:28:46.466 --> 00:28:49.636 A:middle
And now I've learned that to
open a photo, my app needs

00:28:49.636 --> 00:28:51.656 A:middle
about another 2.5
megabytes of memory.

00:28:53.106 --> 00:28:56.486 A:middle
At this point, an additional
interesting experiment is

00:28:56.486 --> 00:28:58.526 A:middle
to repeat the same
action over and over.

00:28:58.706 --> 00:29:01.736 A:middle
So I might open the
same photo or a couple



00:28:58.706 --> 00:29:01.736 A:middle
So I might open the
same photo or a couple

00:29:01.736 --> 00:29:03.226 A:middle
of different photos a few times.

00:29:04.066 --> 00:29:06.036 A:middle
If my memory footprint
continues to grow,

00:29:06.506 --> 00:29:08.466 A:middle
I may have a memory issue
worth investigating.

00:29:10.236 --> 00:29:13.086 A:middle
The final point of
interest here is I am going

00:29:13.086 --> 00:29:15.746 A:middle
to use the Home button on my
device to suspend the app,

00:29:16.196 --> 00:29:17.726 A:middle
and I am going to
see what happens

00:29:17.726 --> 00:29:18.806 A:middle
when it goes into
the background.

00:29:19.466 --> 00:29:22.596 A:middle
And it looks like it shrank down
to actually a little bit smaller

00:29:22.596 --> 00:29:24.256 A:middle
than it was right
after it launched.

00:29:25.296 --> 00:29:26.836 A:middle
This is a great balance
to strike.

00:29:27.746 --> 00:29:29.946 A:middle
You don't want to repeat work
that you did during launch

00:29:30.136 --> 00:29:33.636 A:middle
on resume, but you also want to
stay compact in the background

00:29:33.846 --> 00:29:41.166 A:middle
to make sure your users actually
get to experience that resume.

00:29:41.296 --> 00:29:43.916 A:middle
Important to note that the
Photos framework example app

00:29:43.996 --> 00:29:46.456 A:middle
didn't actually have to do
anything special or magical

00:29:46.646 --> 00:29:47.676 A:middle
to achieve that behavior.

00:29:48.136 --> 00:29:50.266 A:middle
It's actually just a
really straightforward

00:29:50.266 --> 00:29:52.816 A:middle
and minimal implementation
of Apple technologies,

00:29:53.436 --> 00:29:57.046 A:middle
and Apple technologies actually
have this behavior often built

00:29:57.046 --> 00:29:59.786 A:middle
in, and they manage sort of
their underlying resources



00:30:00.046 --> 00:30:02.956 A:middle
in response to application
lifecycle events automatically.

00:30:03.286 --> 00:30:04.256 A:middle
So you don't need
to worry about it.

00:30:05.606 --> 00:30:08.236 A:middle
However, if you have large
objects or other resources

00:30:08.236 --> 00:30:11.406 A:middle
of your own that you'd like
to sort of dynamically lose

00:30:11.406 --> 00:30:14.076 A:middle
and get back in response to
application lifecycle events,

00:30:14.556 --> 00:30:16.456 A:middle
the easiest way to do
it is to use NSCache.

00:30:18.176 --> 00:30:20.726 A:middle
In some cases, though,
you might have things

00:30:20.726 --> 00:30:23.516 A:middle
that can't be neatly
represented as evictable objects

00:30:23.516 --> 00:30:25.446 A:middle
for NSCache, and then you have

00:30:25.476 --> 00:30:28.066 A:middle
to actually implement
custom code that responds

00:30:28.116 --> 00:30:30.396 A:middle
to system lifecycle
notifications in your app.

00:30:31.696 --> 00:30:32.856 A:middle
A few that you might
be interested

00:30:32.856 --> 00:30:35.566 A:middle
in are the 'did enter
background' notification.

00:30:36.346 --> 00:30:38.266 A:middle
Your app will get this
when it's suspended,

00:30:38.266 --> 00:30:41.626 A:middle
and this is what NSCache
uses to actually shrink

00:30:41.816 --> 00:30:42.706 A:middle
when you go into the background.

00:30:43.696 --> 00:30:46.796 A:middle
Another interesting one is the
memory warning notification.

00:30:47.316 --> 00:30:50.356 A:middle
The system actually sends
this before it starts evicting

00:30:50.406 --> 00:30:52.786 A:middle
suspended apps to give
them a chance to shrink,

00:30:53.736 --> 00:30:55.346 A:middle
and maybe they can
avoid getting evicted

00:30:55.586 --> 00:30:56.706 A:middle
if their footprint goes down.

00:30:56.706 --> 00:30:59.146 A:middle
So here is a quick
example of that.

00:30:59.146 --> 00:31:03.266 A:middle
I am going to use the
default NSNotificationCenter.



00:30:59.146 --> 00:31:03.266 A:middle
I am going to use the
default NSNotificationCenter.

00:31:03.266 --> 00:31:05.666 A:middle
I am going to add an
observer for, in this case,

00:31:06.036 --> 00:31:07.926 A:middle
the 'did receive memory
warning' notification.

00:31:08.466 --> 00:31:12.056 A:middle
And all I am going to do
is call some 'custom cache

00:31:12.156 --> 00:31:12.826 A:middle
purging' code.

00:31:14.056 --> 00:31:16.826 A:middle
Maybe this walks a
linked use of C structures

00:31:16.826 --> 00:31:18.126 A:middle
and frees some other memory.

00:31:18.706 --> 00:31:22.336 A:middle
An important note,
if you do register

00:31:22.336 --> 00:31:26.066 A:middle
for NSNotificationCenter
observer, especially in init,

00:31:26.626 --> 00:31:28.786 A:middle
please be sure to remove
yourself on deinit.

00:31:29.636 --> 00:31:31.076 A:middle
So memory is actually
so important

00:31:31.336 --> 00:31:32.686 A:middle
that there's another
talk I am going

00:31:32.686 --> 00:31:33.836 A:middle
to encourage you to go watch.

00:31:35.246 --> 00:31:36.726 A:middle
It's called "Optimizing Your App

00:31:36.876 --> 00:31:39.346 A:middle
for Multitasking
on iPad in iOS 9."

00:31:40.146 --> 00:31:42.706 A:middle
But actually, even if your
app doesn't run on iPad,

00:31:42.706 --> 00:31:44.886 A:middle
or you have no plans to
support Multitasking,

00:31:45.106 --> 00:31:46.396 A:middle
please go watch this talk.

00:31:47.136 --> 00:31:50.036 A:middle
They go into a lot of detail
about the types of resources

00:31:50.036 --> 00:31:51.086 A:middle
that applications use,

00:31:51.556 --> 00:31:53.476 A:middle
the patterns they
typically access them in,

00:31:53.936 --> 00:31:56.796 A:middle
and more information about
how to have your app respond

00:31:56.796 --> 00:31:57.846 A:middle
to system memory state.

00:31:58.436 --> 00:31:58.956 A:middle
It's really great.

00:31:59.466 --> 00:32:04.396 A:middle
Last but not least, I hope
you are all really excited



00:31:59.466 --> 00:32:04.396 A:middle
Last but not least, I hope
you are all really excited

00:32:04.396 --> 00:32:06.366 A:middle
to bring native code
to watchOS 2.

00:32:06.926 --> 00:32:10.716 A:middle
When you are thinking about how
to build your watchOS 2 app,

00:32:11.496 --> 00:32:13.396 A:middle
you have to start
with a great design,

00:32:14.026 --> 00:32:16.906 A:middle
a design that really focuses
on the essential functions

00:32:16.906 --> 00:32:19.366 A:middle
of your app and makes
them easy, delightful,

00:32:19.366 --> 00:32:20.506 A:middle
and accessible to the user.

00:32:21.476 --> 00:32:22.386 A:middle
If you need help with that,

00:32:22.836 --> 00:32:24.856 A:middle
there's a great session
you can go watch called

00:32:24.856 --> 00:32:27.566 A:middle
"Designing for Apple Watch."

00:32:27.766 --> 00:32:30.356 A:middle
Once you've got a great design
for your Apple Watch app,

00:32:31.356 --> 00:32:33.726 A:middle
then you can start to
think about which aspects

00:32:33.726 --> 00:32:36.246 A:middle
of your iOS app it might
make sense to reuse.

00:32:37.226 --> 00:32:42.416 A:middle
This could include actual code
or familiar access patterns

00:32:42.756 --> 00:32:46.926 A:middle
to APIs and frameworks that are
shared between the platforms.

00:32:46.926 --> 00:32:48.776 A:middle
Sometimes something
you are doing

00:32:48.776 --> 00:32:51.336 A:middle
on iOS might actually
not make sense on watchOS

00:32:51.696 --> 00:32:52.756 A:middle
for performance reasons.

00:32:53.236 --> 00:32:55.386 A:middle
And you will end up
implementing new mechanisms

00:32:55.596 --> 00:33:05.426 A:middle
to achieve the same result
on the other platform.



00:32:55.596 --> 00:33:05.426 A:middle
to achieve the same result
on the other platform.

00:33:05.426 --> 00:33:08.426 A:middle
watchOS users expect
short, simple interactions,

00:33:09.016 --> 00:33:12.046 A:middle
and they expect to always
see recent and relevant data

00:33:12.396 --> 00:33:14.556 A:middle
in Apps, Notifications,
and Glances.

00:33:15.736 --> 00:33:18.066 A:middle
What does this mean for
you as an app developer?

00:33:19.146 --> 00:33:21.056 A:middle
The most likely thing
the user will do

00:33:21.056 --> 00:33:24.136 A:middle
on watchOS is just
launch the app and look

00:33:24.136 --> 00:33:26.956 A:middle
at the one thing it shows
immediately afterwards.

00:33:28.296 --> 00:33:30.776 A:middle
So what are some things we can
do to get great launch time

00:33:30.776 --> 00:33:32.776 A:middle
and great responsiveness
on watchOS?

00:33:34.496 --> 00:33:37.086 A:middle
Focus on minimizing
both the amount

00:33:37.086 --> 00:33:40.046 A:middle
of network traffic you generate
and the amount of work you have

00:33:40.046 --> 00:33:42.576 A:middle
to do on the device to do
something sensible with it.

00:33:43.876 --> 00:33:46.306 A:middle
If you are accessing a
server that you can control

00:33:46.356 --> 00:33:50.806 A:middle
and add new APIs to, make sure
you are sending appropriately

00:33:50.806 --> 00:33:52.956 A:middle
sized and formatted
responses down to the Watch.

00:33:54.116 --> 00:33:57.566 A:middle
This can include something as
simple as removing unused keys

00:33:57.686 --> 00:34:01.496 A:middle
from JSON or XML
blobs; resizing images



00:33:57.686 --> 00:34:01.496 A:middle
from JSON or XML
blobs; resizing images

00:34:01.786 --> 00:34:03.926 A:middle
so that the Watch can
just display them exactly

00:34:03.926 --> 00:34:05.596 A:middle
as they came over the
wire and doesn't have

00:34:05.626 --> 00:34:09.616 A:middle
to do any extra work; and
if your API is accustomed

00:34:09.616 --> 00:34:13.186 A:middle
to feeding devices with large
screens that can show 10

00:34:13.186 --> 00:34:16.496 A:middle
or 20 records at a time,
it may be sending back all

00:34:16.496 --> 00:34:17.946 A:middle
that information in one call.

00:34:18.485 --> 00:34:19.585 A:middle
But actually, for the Watch,

00:34:19.946 --> 00:34:21.766 A:middle
you should send only
the appropriate number

00:34:21.766 --> 00:34:24.466 A:middle
of records needed to
display a single screen.

00:34:25.746 --> 00:34:28.246 A:middle
To show fresh, relevant
information all the time,

00:34:28.806 --> 00:34:30.576 A:middle
it's important to
use your iPhone app

00:34:30.706 --> 00:34:32.386 A:middle
to keep the app context updated.

00:34:33.196 --> 00:34:36.505 A:middle
The app context is a piece
of bidirectional shared state

00:34:36.556 --> 00:34:37.436 A:middle
between the platforms.

00:34:37.876 --> 00:34:40.216 A:middle
So when the user takes
an action on either end

00:34:40.216 --> 00:34:42.746 A:middle
that will cause them to expect
to see something different

00:34:42.746 --> 00:34:45.065 A:middle
on the other end,
that can be updated.

00:34:45.676 --> 00:34:49.235 A:middle
The API for doing this is
'watch connectivity update

00:34:49.235 --> 00:34:50.315 A:middle
application context.'

00:34:51.346 --> 00:34:55.036 A:middle
A great time to do this is
when your iPhone app gets woken

00:34:55.036 --> 00:34:56.686 A:middle
up by background app refresh.

00:34:57.616 --> 00:34:59.286 A:middle
When it's done downloading
new information

00:34:59.286 --> 00:35:02.156 A:middle
and updating its own
snapshot, it can also push



00:34:59.286 --> 00:35:02.156 A:middle
and updating its own
snapshot, it can also push

00:35:02.156 --> 00:35:03.596 A:middle
that information
over to the Watch

00:35:03.906 --> 00:35:06.236 A:middle
so that it will be ready
next time the user launches.

00:35:09.276 --> 00:35:12.816 A:middle
Finally, in case you're
relying on a server

00:35:12.816 --> 00:35:14.516 A:middle
that you can't change
for some reason,

00:35:15.246 --> 00:35:17.156 A:middle
let's say you're hitting
a third-party API,

00:35:18.306 --> 00:35:21.166 A:middle
you can use the power of your
iPhone's network connection

00:35:21.456 --> 00:35:25.226 A:middle
and CPU to actually implement
an intermediary that formats

00:35:25.226 --> 00:35:26.936 A:middle
and sizes responses
for the Watch.

00:35:27.946 --> 00:35:30.866 A:middle
The API you would use to do
this is 'watch connectivity

00:35:31.036 --> 00:35:32.396 A:middle
send message.'

00:35:33.156 --> 00:35:35.296 A:middle
So you would send a
message to the iPhone,

00:35:36.176 --> 00:35:38.256 A:middle
requesting whatever you need,

00:35:38.256 --> 00:35:39.436 A:middle
and the iPhone would
download it,

00:35:40.276 --> 00:35:43.196 A:middle
and do all the operations I
mentioned, remove unused keys,

00:35:43.386 --> 00:35:45.436 A:middle
reduce the number of
records, resize images.

00:35:46.286 --> 00:35:49.466 A:middle
Then it could send a compact and
actionable reply to the Watch,

00:35:49.846 --> 00:35:51.366 A:middle
again, over WC Session.

00:35:51.926 --> 00:35:55.336 A:middle
So wrapping up, performance
is a feature.

00:35:56.026 --> 00:35:57.336 A:middle
It's an essential aspect

00:35:57.656 --> 00:36:00.006 A:middle
of giving your users a great
experience in your apps.



00:35:57.656 --> 00:36:00.006 A:middle
of giving your users a great
experience in your apps.

00:36:00.756 --> 00:36:02.676 A:middle
And it should be on
your mind from day one

00:36:02.726 --> 00:36:04.416 A:middle
when you are building your apps.

00:36:05.376 --> 00:36:07.686 A:middle
Efficient apps feel great
when you are using them,

00:36:08.126 --> 00:36:12.186 A:middle
they build your users' trust,
and they save battery power.

00:36:13.416 --> 00:36:16.826 A:middle
Please go learn about all the
Apple technologies I mentioned,

00:36:17.266 --> 00:36:17.846 A:middle
and when you are thinking

00:36:17.846 --> 00:36:19.626 A:middle
about building your app,
choose the best ones.

00:36:20.916 --> 00:36:22.986 A:middle
Keep your main thread
always ready for user input.

00:36:24.346 --> 00:36:26.426 A:middle
Understand when and why
your app uses memory.

00:36:27.416 --> 00:36:30.086 A:middle
And to get a great
experience on watchOS, download

00:36:30.086 --> 00:36:32.036 A:middle
and process a minimal
set of information.

00:36:32.536 --> 00:36:36.126 A:middle
Here's some great written
documentation you can get

00:36:36.126 --> 00:36:38.216 A:middle
into if you are starting to
get interested in this stuff.

00:36:39.376 --> 00:36:41.456 A:middle
And again, here are the
sessions that I mentioned.

00:36:42.456 --> 00:36:44.716 A:middle
The first few are
about technologies

00:36:44.716 --> 00:36:46.416 A:middle
that we covered this
year, and there's a few

00:36:46.416 --> 00:36:47.496 A:middle
from previous years as well.

00:36:47.496 --> 00:36:48.766 A:middle
Thanks, and have a great Friday.

00:36:49.516 --> 00:36:52.500 A:middle
[Applause]
