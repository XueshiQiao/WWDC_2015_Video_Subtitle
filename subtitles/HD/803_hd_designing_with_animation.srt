&gt;&gt; JULIAN MISSIG:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:43.046 A:middle
I am Julian.

00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:45.196 A:middle
I brought along my
teammates, Joe and Marek.

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:47.496 A:middle
Welcome to Designing
with Animation.

00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:54.756 A:middle
If you have an app or a
game, you've probably come

00:00:54.756 --> 00:00:57.376 A:middle
across the circumstance where
you want to tell someone

00:00:57.696 --> 00:00:58.896 A:middle
that something has happened.

00:00:59.596 --> 00:01:01.656 A:middle
Perhaps a new item is
added to this list.



00:00:59.596 --> 00:01:01.656 A:middle
Perhaps a new item is
added to this list.

00:01:02.426 --> 00:01:06.206 A:middle
You could do something
like this.

00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.366 A:middle
Or perhaps you would like people

00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:14.586 A:middle
to understand how two different
parts of your app are related.

00:01:15.146 --> 00:01:18.636 A:middle
You could do something
like this ...

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:24.986 A:middle
Or maybe your app has a gesture
you've just introduced and you'd

00:01:24.986 --> 00:01:27.156 A:middle
like people to understand
how the gesture works.

00:01:28.216 --> 00:01:31.296 A:middle
You could do something
like this ...

00:01:31.956 --> 00:01:35.296 A:middle
Now, as you might suspect, given
the name of the talk today,

00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:38.736 A:middle
there is another way to do this.

00:01:39.086 --> 00:01:42.506 A:middle
Today we're going to talk
about how you can use animation

00:01:43.016 --> 00:01:48.006 A:middle
to direct people's attention,
keep people oriented,

00:01:49.406 --> 00:01:52.806 A:middle
and connect people's behavior
to what's happening on screen.

00:01:53.426 --> 00:01:56.136 A:middle
But before we get into that,

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:57.546 A:middle
just a little bit
about who we are.

00:01:58.176 --> 00:02:02.466 A:middle
We're a team of inventors,
designers, and prototypers.



00:01:58.176 --> 00:02:02.466 A:middle
We're a team of inventors,
designers, and prototypers.

00:02:03.776 --> 00:02:07.826 A:middle
We explore what new interfaces
mean for Apple's products,

00:02:08.406 --> 00:02:10.776 A:middle
including trackpad
gestures, Force Touch,

00:02:11.296 --> 00:02:14.226 A:middle
and the Taptic Engine.

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:19.846 A:middle
But we don't make full
working apps to do this.

00:02:21.366 --> 00:02:23.396 A:middle
We make little animated
experiments

00:02:23.596 --> 00:02:24.756 A:middle
and interactive prototypes.

00:02:25.446 --> 00:02:27.276 A:middle
Today we will talk a little
bit about what that means.

00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:34.606 A:middle
So the plan for today is to
ease in to the what, why,

00:02:34.656 --> 00:02:38.826 A:middle
and how of animation;
to communicate an idea

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:44.026 A:middle
by animating it; and to learn a
little bit about how animation

00:02:44.106 --> 00:02:46.216 A:middle
and interaction are intertwined.

00:02:51.416 --> 00:02:52.886 A:middle
So what is animation?

00:02:53.816 --> 00:02:58.886 A:middle
How do we think about animation
when we are making our apps?

00:02:59.126 --> 00:03:03.866 A:middle
Well, at one point in time,
your app will have one screen,



00:02:59.126 --> 00:03:03.866 A:middle
Well, at one point in time,
your app will have one screen,

00:03:05.126 --> 00:03:09.006 A:middle
and at some other point in time,
it will have some other screen.

00:03:09.736 --> 00:03:13.926 A:middle
Because these two apps don't
exist at the exact same time,

00:03:15.436 --> 00:03:17.986 A:middle
there is going to be some
kind of change between them,

00:03:18.216 --> 00:03:19.816 A:middle
even if it's just an
instantaneous pop.

00:03:20.756 --> 00:03:22.706 A:middle
It's this change that
we are talking about,

00:03:22.706 --> 00:03:25.866 A:middle
this change over time, when
we think about animation.

00:03:27.436 --> 00:03:30.326 A:middle
Now, because humans usually
can't perceive instantaneous

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:31.996 A:middle
change unless you
are pretty special,

00:03:33.886 --> 00:03:36.966 A:middle
you can slowly change
things over time

00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:39.696 A:middle
to communicate something
about how things are related.

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:42.466 A:middle
So animation is change
over time.

00:03:43.876 --> 00:03:46.446 A:middle
But you'll note that when I
was talking about this change

00:03:46.446 --> 00:03:49.626 A:middle
over time, I already
had those two screens.

00:03:49.726 --> 00:03:52.196 A:middle
Animation isn't going to solve
all of your design problems.

00:03:52.196 --> 00:03:53.936 A:middle
You still need to go
out there and figure

00:03:53.936 --> 00:03:56.076 A:middle
out which screens
your app should have

00:03:56.116 --> 00:03:57.826 A:middle
and what should be on them.

00:03:59.696 --> 00:04:04.636 A:middle
But the manner of this change



00:03:59.696 --> 00:04:04.636 A:middle
But the manner of this change

00:04:04.636 --> 00:04:06.896 A:middle
over time can communicate
things.

00:04:08.386 --> 00:04:10.576 A:middle
Chances are your app has
more than just two screens.

00:04:11.106 --> 00:04:13.486 A:middle
In fact, it may have many,
many different screens.

00:04:15.016 --> 00:04:18.435 A:middle
And you can use a different type
of animation for the transition

00:04:18.435 --> 00:04:22.176 A:middle
between different types of
screens to communicate something

00:04:22.176 --> 00:04:24.216 A:middle
about how all the screens
relate to one another.

00:04:26.456 --> 00:04:31.346 A:middle
So all this different change
over time communicates something

00:04:31.346 --> 00:04:34.036 A:middle
about how all of the screens
in your app fit together.

00:04:34.606 --> 00:04:36.926 A:middle
This is a very practical way
of thinking about animation.

00:04:36.926 --> 00:04:38.396 A:middle
It's solving some
of these problems.

00:04:39.106 --> 00:04:42.896 A:middle
But there's another
thing to pay attention

00:04:42.896 --> 00:04:46.646 A:middle
to when you are looking at the
manner of the change over time.

00:04:47.216 --> 00:04:51.306 A:middle
If we go back to that example
of adding a new item to a list,

00:04:52.506 --> 00:04:54.486 A:middle
you could animate a
new item in like this.

00:04:55.326 --> 00:04:59.156 A:middle
And this might be
appropriate for a game

00:04:59.186 --> 00:05:02.266 A:middle
if a new player has been added,
and this is a very rare event



00:04:59.186 --> 00:05:02.266 A:middle
if a new player has been added,
and this is a very rare event

00:05:02.266 --> 00:05:03.636 A:middle
and you want to kind
of celebrate it.

00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:07.386 A:middle
But for most apps, you
probably don't need to go

00:05:07.386 --> 00:05:08.606 A:middle
that far with your animation.

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:14.026 A:middle
You might be more familiar with
an animation kind of like this.

00:05:14.236 --> 00:05:16.996 A:middle
The point is both of these
animations are communicating

00:05:16.996 --> 00:05:19.936 A:middle
that a new item has been
added, but they do it

00:05:19.936 --> 00:05:20.786 A:middle
in a different manner.

00:05:21.896 --> 00:05:24.566 A:middle
They communicate something
about your app's character.

00:05:24.976 --> 00:05:27.776 A:middle
It's an artful way of thinking
about this change over time

00:05:28.316 --> 00:05:31.306 A:middle
that tells you how
the app feels.

00:05:31.816 --> 00:05:35.406 A:middle
Especially as we start to look
at content front and center

00:05:35.406 --> 00:05:40.206 A:middle
in apps, the motion of this
content can be very powerful

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:48.546 A:middle
in communicating what your
app is and how it feels.

00:05:48.776 --> 00:05:50.216 A:middle
So why should we animate?

00:05:50.486 --> 00:05:55.306 A:middle
When do we decide to start
looking at animations?

00:05:55.376 --> 00:05:58.166 A:middle
Well, there are probably a
lot of different reasons,

00:05:58.306 --> 00:06:01.346 A:middle
so today we are just going to
look at three main categories.



00:05:58.306 --> 00:06:01.346 A:middle
so today we are just going to
look at three main categories.

00:06:02.116 --> 00:06:06.776 A:middle
The first is to direct
people's attention.

00:06:06.776 --> 00:06:09.766 A:middle
To help them become
aware that something

00:06:09.766 --> 00:06:14.016 A:middle
within your app has changed.

00:06:14.426 --> 00:06:18.396 A:middle
Perhaps something behind the
scenes in your app has changed.

00:06:18.426 --> 00:06:19.816 A:middle
You want your users
to understand

00:06:19.816 --> 00:06:22.306 A:middle
that there's something
new that they can explore.

00:06:22.956 --> 00:06:31.276 A:middle
Or perhaps your user has
performed some type of action.

00:06:32.376 --> 00:06:33.636 A:middle
Maybe you are going
to press and hold

00:06:33.636 --> 00:06:34.916 A:middle
on these icons for a little bit.

00:06:36.036 --> 00:06:40.586 A:middle
This animation is communicating
the result of the user's action.

00:06:40.796 --> 00:06:46.066 A:middle
By pressing and holding, I've
changed the state of the app.

00:06:46.336 --> 00:06:48.286 A:middle
So directing attention
can be useful

00:06:48.346 --> 00:06:50.466 A:middle
for both of those scenarios.

00:06:54.256 --> 00:06:59.446 A:middle
The second reason to animate is
to help keep people oriented.

00:06:59.446 --> 00:07:03.666 A:middle
To help them understand where
they are within your app



00:06:59.446 --> 00:07:03.666 A:middle
To help them understand where
they are within your app

00:07:03.666 --> 00:07:04.356 A:middle
and where they've been.

00:07:05.026 --> 00:07:09.976 A:middle
So if we just take a look at
tapping on the Back button

00:07:09.976 --> 00:07:16.526 A:middle
in Mail, for example, there's
an animation that happens.

00:07:16.696 --> 00:07:18.966 A:middle
And you can see that this
animation is communicating

00:07:18.966 --> 00:07:21.496 A:middle
something about these
screens almost being stacked

00:07:21.496 --> 00:07:22.456 A:middle
on top of one another.

00:07:23.676 --> 00:07:25.946 A:middle
But if we slow it down
and really take a look

00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:27.696 A:middle
at what's going on,
there's some subtlety

00:07:27.696 --> 00:07:32.256 A:middle
to this animation that's
reinforcing what's happening

00:07:32.296 --> 00:07:33.286 A:middle
as the user is going back.

00:07:34.766 --> 00:07:36.476 A:middle
So watch as I press
the Back button now.

00:07:37.136 --> 00:07:40.446 A:middle
You can see that the label

00:07:40.506 --> 00:07:43.136 A:middle
from that button becomes
the new section header

00:07:43.486 --> 00:07:44.396 A:middle
for where I now am.

00:07:46.396 --> 00:07:53.536 A:middle
It's subtle, but if you pay
attention to it, it's there.

00:07:53.746 --> 00:07:55.466 A:middle
The third reason to animate is

00:07:56.636 --> 00:07:58.996 A:middle
to help connect people's
behavior

00:07:59.386 --> 00:08:00.776 A:middle
to what's happening on screen.



00:07:59.386 --> 00:08:00.776 A:middle
to what's happening on screen.

00:08:02.126 --> 00:08:04.296 A:middle
We want people to
feel in control

00:08:04.296 --> 00:08:06.166 A:middle
of your app at all times.

00:08:08.276 --> 00:08:11.726 A:middle
If we look at Notification
Center as an example,

00:08:12.336 --> 00:08:17.926 A:middle
as I start controlling it, I can
actually see what's happening,

00:08:18.426 --> 00:08:21.286 A:middle
where my finger is, even
though you can't see my finger

00:08:21.286 --> 00:08:21.746 A:middle
in this video.

00:08:22.976 --> 00:08:27.796 A:middle
We can break this down
a little bit and think

00:08:27.796 --> 00:08:30.286 A:middle
about how we connect
people's behavior.

00:08:31.976 --> 00:08:33.635 A:middle
I start going into
Notification Center

00:08:33.635 --> 00:08:36.956 A:middle
by touching the top
of the screen.

00:08:37.145 --> 00:08:42.765 A:middle
Then, as my finger moves, the
Notification Center is connected

00:08:42.765 --> 00:08:43.966 A:middle
to my finger at all times.

00:08:44.226 --> 00:08:47.456 A:middle
I can see what is happening
and what's going to happen.

00:08:47.456 --> 00:08:50.386 A:middle
I get a hint about
what's going to happen.

00:08:50.386 --> 00:08:53.356 A:middle
And then if I flick
back up or flick down,

00:08:53.356 --> 00:08:56.376 A:middle
it will either cancel or
complete this gesture.

00:08:57.386 --> 00:08:59.636 A:middle
And the animation will
respond appropriately.



00:09:00.946 --> 00:09:04.426 A:middle
And perhaps even hint at how I
can reverse out of this mode.

00:09:04.966 --> 00:09:07.896 A:middle
This helps you feel in control,

00:09:08.206 --> 00:09:10.506 A:middle
but it also tells you how
the gesture itself works.

00:09:11.386 --> 00:09:17.996 A:middle
So these are three reasons we
are going to talk about today.

00:09:19.546 --> 00:09:21.496 A:middle
But how do we try
out animations?

00:09:22.196 --> 00:09:27.026 A:middle
Part of it is we want
to be able to understand

00:09:27.336 --> 00:09:29.216 A:middle
which animations we should use.

00:09:30.866 --> 00:09:34.326 A:middle
As we're designing our
app, we start to draw a lot

00:09:34.326 --> 00:09:38.336 A:middle
of screenshots, but these
screenshots show you too little.

00:09:39.306 --> 00:09:42.516 A:middle
You can't actually understand
anything about the manner

00:09:42.926 --> 00:09:46.046 A:middle
in which you're transitioning
from one screen to another

00:09:46.046 --> 00:09:47.436 A:middle
if it's not moving at all.

00:09:48.446 --> 00:09:52.586 A:middle
So we could go and build
a real working app.

00:09:53.716 --> 00:09:55.446 A:middle
But apps actually
show you too much.

00:09:57.416 --> 00:09:59.086 A:middle
There are a lot of
details involved

00:09:59.086 --> 00:10:02.366 A:middle
in building a full working
app that get in the way



00:09:59.086 --> 00:10:02.366 A:middle
in building a full working
app that get in the way

00:10:02.366 --> 00:10:05.336 A:middle
of exploring many different
types of animation; right?

00:10:05.386 --> 00:10:07.236 A:middle
We want to be able to
try a whole lot of things

00:10:07.286 --> 00:10:08.316 A:middle
to figure out what's right.

00:10:08.906 --> 00:10:17.156 A:middle
So what we do is make
little animated experiments.

00:10:18.066 --> 00:10:21.366 A:middle
We find ways that we can try
out many different animations

00:10:22.416 --> 00:10:25.596 A:middle
because this allows us to
try built-in animations

00:10:25.956 --> 00:10:27.926 A:middle
and compare those to
custom animations.

00:10:27.926 --> 00:10:30.606 A:middle
Maybe we have some brilliant
new idea for an animation,

00:10:30.886 --> 00:10:32.146 A:middle
but we should still
compare it back

00:10:32.216 --> 00:10:34.586 A:middle
to what the standard iOS
one would be to make sure

00:10:34.586 --> 00:10:37.426 A:middle
that our intuition that this
is brilliant is right; right?

00:10:37.426 --> 00:10:40.676 A:middle
We need to see both of them.

00:10:41.316 --> 00:10:42.286 A:middle
So really what we
are doing here,

00:10:42.286 --> 00:10:45.796 A:middle
we think of this as
making prototypes.

00:10:45.796 --> 00:10:46.986 A:middle
Even though it's not in code,

00:10:47.096 --> 00:10:49.496 A:middle
we are kind of making
little experiments.

00:10:49.496 --> 00:10:51.356 A:middle
We are trying things
out that aren't real.

00:10:52.256 --> 00:10:54.616 A:middle
We are making these prototypes,
showing them to people,

00:10:55.276 --> 00:10:56.376 A:middle
and learning from
their feedback.

00:10:57.566 --> 00:11:00.316 A:middle
This is actually a
bit of a cycle; right?



00:10:57.566 --> 00:11:00.316 A:middle
This is actually a
bit of a cycle; right?

00:11:00.316 --> 00:11:01.926 A:middle
We make things, we
show them to people,

00:11:02.236 --> 00:11:03.276 A:middle
we learn from their feedback.

00:11:04.316 --> 00:11:05.696 A:middle
Something we've talked
about a little bit before

00:11:05.696 --> 00:11:06.466 A:middle
in some other sessions.

00:11:08.216 --> 00:11:13.606 A:middle
So today, to get a more
concrete example of how we try

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:16.826 A:middle
out animation, we are going to
build some animated prototypes

00:11:17.696 --> 00:11:19.646 A:middle
for an app that some of
you might have heard of.

00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:21.316 A:middle
It's called Toast Modern.

00:11:22.251 --> 00:11:24.251 A:middle
[Applause]

00:11:24.486 --> 00:11:26.316 A:middle
Now, it's okay if you
haven't heard of Toast Modern.

00:11:27.076 --> 00:11:29.196 A:middle
It still has its
original feature,

00:11:29.836 --> 00:11:36.636 A:middle
which is to help people
find local artisanal toast,

00:11:37.426 --> 00:11:39.646 A:middle
San Francisco's finest
food export.

00:11:40.966 --> 00:11:42.746 A:middle
But over the past year,
Toast Modern has been

00:11:42.876 --> 00:11:46.006 A:middle
so successful we've been adding
all sorts of new features.

00:11:47.536 --> 00:11:49.866 A:middle
People can share the toast
they found with other people.

00:11:50.396 --> 00:11:54.356 A:middle
You can comment on toast.

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:57.356 A:middle
If you watched a session
yesterday, you might have seen

00:11:57.356 --> 00:12:00.886 A:middle
that we've connected Toast
Modern to Toastal Service.



00:11:57.356 --> 00:12:00.886 A:middle
that we've connected Toast
Modern to Toastal Service.

00:12:01.636 --> 00:12:04.886 A:middle
The world's first
social toaster.

00:12:05.031 --> 00:12:07.031 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:12:07.046 --> 00:12:08.736 A:middle
And now that people are
making their own toast

00:12:09.016 --> 00:12:12.626 A:middle
and posting these pictures,
I can see my toast along

00:12:12.626 --> 00:12:13.666 A:middle
with these toast restaurants.

00:12:14.736 --> 00:12:16.106 A:middle
And now I can see
my friend's toast.

00:12:17.276 --> 00:12:18.796 A:middle
And frankly, the biggest
thing we are seeing

00:12:18.796 --> 00:12:21.886 A:middle
with this app now is we are just
getting overwhelmed by toast.

00:12:22.586 --> 00:12:28.406 A:middle
So today we are going to
focus on a single feature.

00:12:28.406 --> 00:12:31.096 A:middle
We are going to really
dive in and look

00:12:31.096 --> 00:12:33.676 A:middle
at different ways we can
animate just this one feature

00:12:33.896 --> 00:12:35.646 A:middle
and how we can make just
this one feature great.

00:12:35.646 --> 00:12:40.176 A:middle
What we are going to do is
slice through all this toast

00:12:40.946 --> 00:12:41.996 A:middle
to find our favorites.

00:12:43.336 --> 00:12:47.526 A:middle
Now, to do that, without
writing a line of code,

00:12:48.146 --> 00:12:49.976 A:middle
I would like to invite
Joe up to the stage.

00:12:50.516 --> 00:12:55.666 A:middle
[Applause]

00:12:56.166 --> 00:12:56.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JOE MALIA: Thanks, Julian.

00:12:58.886 --> 00:13:05.686 A:middle
Hi. I'm Joe, and I spend most
of my day in the team designing



00:12:58.886 --> 00:13:05.686 A:middle
Hi. I'm Joe, and I spend most
of my day in the team designing

00:13:05.686 --> 00:13:09.116 A:middle
and animating and not
writing very much code.

00:13:10.076 --> 00:13:12.766 A:middle
So today I am going
to be talking

00:13:12.766 --> 00:13:17.476 A:middle
about the Favorites
button in Toast Modern.

00:13:17.476 --> 00:13:21.626 A:middle
So we are going to run
through a few ideas

00:13:21.846 --> 00:13:24.526 A:middle
for how animation can
bring a feature to life.

00:13:26.006 --> 00:13:27.376 A:middle
We are going to look
at the process

00:13:27.466 --> 00:13:30.016 A:middle
of designing animation
into an app.

00:13:30.466 --> 00:13:33.346 A:middle
We are going to look in at a
few places where animation fits,

00:13:33.346 --> 00:13:35.136 A:middle
a few places that it doesn't.

00:13:36.196 --> 00:13:39.936 A:middle
Animation is a powerful
- [ding] -- I am sorry.

00:13:39.936 --> 00:13:41.606 A:middle
This is a little
bit embarrassing,

00:13:41.606 --> 00:13:44.296 A:middle
but I forgot to turn
my phone off.

00:13:44.766 --> 00:13:47.686 A:middle
So let me just -- oh,
actually, it's okay.

00:13:47.686 --> 00:13:49.796 A:middle
It's an email from
the Toast Modern CEO.

00:13:50.086 --> 00:13:52.746 A:middle
Bill, could we get this
up on screen, please?

00:13:53.576 --> 00:13:55.406 A:middle
Thanks. Okay.

00:13:56.596 --> 00:13:56.916 A:middle
So -

00:13:57.516 --> 00:13:59.976 A:middle
[Applause]



00:14:00.476 --> 00:14:01.906 A:middle
-- he's had some thoughts.

00:14:05.276 --> 00:14:06.906 A:middle
So let's see what he says.

00:14:07.476 --> 00:14:09.986 A:middle
After some deep meditation
in my yurt,

00:14:11.196 --> 00:14:12.586 A:middle
some revolutionary new ideas

00:14:12.866 --> 00:14:15.506 A:middle
for our app have come
into focus for me.

00:14:16.176 --> 00:14:18.886 A:middle
People need to know that the
Favorite button is there.

00:14:19.156 --> 00:14:20.446 A:middle
Okay? We can do that.

00:14:21.706 --> 00:14:24.806 A:middle
Two, people need to
be able to find toast

00:14:25.036 --> 00:14:25.916 A:middle
that they've favorited.

00:14:26.076 --> 00:14:26.996 A:middle
Okay. That sounds fair enough.

00:14:27.956 --> 00:14:31.486 A:middle
Three, using the Favorite button
should be simple and elegant.

00:14:31.836 --> 00:14:33.816 A:middle
People should be able to
use it from the first touch.

00:14:33.996 --> 00:14:34.706 A:middle
That sounds fair enough.

00:14:34.706 --> 00:14:36.556 A:middle
Okay? So no rush.

00:14:36.766 --> 00:14:40.906 A:middle
Just send me something to try
out in the next 20 minutes.

00:14:41.516 --> 00:14:43.566 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:14:44.066 --> 00:14:44.756 A:middle
Namaste. Okay.

00:14:45.016 --> 00:14:46.296 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:14:46.296 --> 00:14:48.226 A:middle
So here we go.

00:14:48.226 --> 00:14:50.946 A:middle
We haven't got much time,
so we need to dive right in.

00:14:51.286 --> 00:14:54.946 A:middle
We are going to start trying to
animate as many different ideas

00:14:54.946 --> 00:14:58.726 A:middle
as we possibly can in a short
time, get through as many

00:14:58.726 --> 00:15:00.876 A:middle
as we can quickly, and
get them onto a device.



00:14:58.726 --> 00:15:00.876 A:middle
as we can quickly, and
get them onto a device.

00:15:02.106 --> 00:15:05.006 A:middle
So the designers out there
amongst you might use

00:15:05.006 --> 00:15:08.596 A:middle
After Effects or Quartz Composer
in a situation like this.

00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:13.356 A:middle
Any developers might
turn to Swift, HTML, CSS.

00:15:13.356 --> 00:15:17.786 A:middle
So these are great tools,
but for those of you

00:15:17.786 --> 00:15:20.346 A:middle
that don't know those
tools or don't have access

00:15:20.386 --> 00:15:24.096 A:middle
to them, there is Keynote.

00:15:24.426 --> 00:15:27.176 A:middle
And that's what we are
going to be using today

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:30.086 A:middle
because it's very quick to
make animations, and it's very,

00:15:30.086 --> 00:15:33.456 A:middle
very quick to get
things onto a device.

00:15:33.616 --> 00:15:38.276 A:middle
So let's look again at
the requests from our CEO.

00:15:39.806 --> 00:15:43.956 A:middle
Conveniently, they map very well
to the three principles laid

00:15:43.956 --> 00:15:45.616 A:middle
out by Julian in his
part of the talk.

00:15:45.616 --> 00:15:50.096 A:middle
So let's focus on the
first one to begin with.

00:15:50.676 --> 00:15:52.606 A:middle
People need to know that the
Favorite button is there.

00:15:54.056 --> 00:15:57.766 A:middle
So let's look at an example
where animation is used

00:15:58.066 --> 00:16:02.146 A:middle
to subtly draw attention
to a feature within an app.



00:15:58.066 --> 00:16:02.146 A:middle
to subtly draw attention
to a feature within an app.

00:16:02.646 --> 00:16:06.416 A:middle
As we can see here, the
iBeam is blinking slowly

00:16:06.416 --> 00:16:09.036 A:middle
to pull people's attention
to it, to show people

00:16:09.036 --> 00:16:11.586 A:middle
where text will be entered
as they start to type.

00:16:12.396 --> 00:16:15.506 A:middle
It's very subtle but
actually really easy to pick

00:16:15.506 --> 00:16:17.066 A:middle
out amongst all the text.

00:16:17.616 --> 00:16:20.586 A:middle
What we can see here is the
change is very attractive

00:16:20.586 --> 00:16:20.946 A:middle
to the eye.

00:16:22.476 --> 00:16:25.406 A:middle
So let's think about
a few different ways

00:16:25.406 --> 00:16:28.226 A:middle
that we can use animation
to draw attention

00:16:28.326 --> 00:16:29.186 A:middle
to our Favorite button.

00:16:29.766 --> 00:16:34.836 A:middle
So we don't have much
time, as you have seen.

00:16:34.836 --> 00:16:39.176 A:middle
All I've done is screen-grabbed
the existing Toast Modern

00:16:39.176 --> 00:16:40.366 A:middle
layout, and I am just going

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:41.906 A:middle
to paste it straight
into Keynote here.

00:16:42.076 --> 00:16:45.796 A:middle
So we are going to
open the shapes panel

00:16:46.206 --> 00:16:49.076 A:middle
and grab the star icon,
and we are going to place

00:16:49.146 --> 00:16:51.526 A:middle
that into each line in our list.

00:16:53.986 --> 00:16:55.076 A:middle
Okay. Great.

00:16:55.606 --> 00:16:59.396 A:middle
Now let's zoom in to get
a closer look and think

00:16:59.396 --> 00:17:01.546 A:middle
about how we can change
some of the properties



00:16:59.396 --> 00:17:01.546 A:middle
about how we can change
some of the properties

00:17:01.546 --> 00:17:03.376 A:middle
of this button over time.

00:17:03.966 --> 00:17:08.286 A:middle
So we can change the opacity
to simulate the gentle blinking

00:17:08.286 --> 00:17:09.516 A:middle
that we saw in the
Notes app earlier.

00:17:09.516 --> 00:17:11.496 A:middle
Okay. That's nice.

00:17:12.026 --> 00:17:12.756 A:middle
It's pretty subtle.

00:17:13.526 --> 00:17:14.546 A:middle
How about something
more dramatic?

00:17:14.546 --> 00:17:18.246 A:middle
We could change the
rotation, the color,

00:17:18.396 --> 00:17:20.126 A:middle
the scale, at the same time.

00:17:20.976 --> 00:17:23.336 A:middle
We could change the shape.

00:17:24.626 --> 00:17:26.935 A:middle
It's just scaling down
one object and scaling

00:17:26.935 --> 00:17:27.986 A:middle
up another one quickly.

00:17:27.986 --> 00:17:32.856 A:middle
We could give it some character
by sticking some bounce in there

00:17:32.856 --> 00:17:33.706 A:middle
and adding a little face.

00:17:33.826 --> 00:17:37.706 A:middle
So we could animate the
layers at timed intervals

00:17:38.336 --> 00:17:40.156 A:middle
to create some patterns as well.

00:17:41.466 --> 00:17:47.396 A:middle
So let's zoom back out and try
that one across the entire list

00:17:47.396 --> 00:17:51.816 A:middle
to see how attention-grabbing
it is.

00:17:52.036 --> 00:17:54.976 A:middle
Okay. So it's definitely
grabbing attention,

00:17:55.666 --> 00:17:58.586 A:middle
but if it's going to be
animating constantly like this,

00:17:59.296 --> 00:18:01.986 A:middle
it could go way beyond
just grabbing attention,



00:17:59.296 --> 00:18:01.986 A:middle
it could go way beyond
just grabbing attention,

00:18:01.986 --> 00:18:03.516 A:middle
actually become quite
distracting.

00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:06.126 A:middle
It's not really telling
us anything new

00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:07.706 A:middle
by animating all the time.

00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:11.056 A:middle
So let's look at a few
examples around iOS

00:18:11.796 --> 00:18:16.046 A:middle
where animation is used to
draw attention and have a look

00:18:16.046 --> 00:18:17.396 A:middle
at when it's relevant.

00:18:18.626 --> 00:18:21.856 A:middle
We see our notification
for an email appear

00:18:21.886 --> 00:18:24.136 A:middle
at the moment that
we get an email.

00:18:24.376 --> 00:18:29.326 A:middle
Okay? We see this gently pulsing
link appear when we've jumped

00:18:29.326 --> 00:18:32.316 A:middle
out of an app to
help us get back in.

00:18:32.316 --> 00:18:34.496 A:middle
And notifications
shift into view

00:18:34.796 --> 00:18:38.786 A:middle
when there's something very
important for us to know.

00:18:38.786 --> 00:18:41.706 A:middle
So the thing that these
animations have in common is

00:18:41.706 --> 00:18:43.416 A:middle
that they occur at the moment

00:18:43.416 --> 00:18:44.576 A:middle
that they are relevant
to the user.

00:18:45.606 --> 00:18:47.476 A:middle
They are not constantly
calling for attention.

00:18:48.656 --> 00:18:51.186 A:middle
We want people to notice
the Favorite button

00:18:51.316 --> 00:18:53.196 A:middle
when they first use the app.

00:18:54.496 --> 00:18:57.766 A:middle
So we can use animation
to introduce the feature

00:18:58.026 --> 00:18:59.056 A:middle
when people launch the app.

00:18:59.576 --> 00:19:04.366 A:middle
And actually, there's
a whole bunch



00:18:59.576 --> 00:19:04.366 A:middle
And actually, there's
a whole bunch

00:19:04.366 --> 00:19:06.046 A:middle
of different ways we
could just move the button

00:19:06.046 --> 00:19:07.276 A:middle
into position like this.

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:10.146 A:middle
So these are looking nice,

00:19:10.426 --> 00:19:14.036 A:middle
but they actually dominate the
action for a chunk of time,

00:19:14.036 --> 00:19:16.676 A:middle
and if I am just obsessed
with toast, really want to get

00:19:16.676 --> 00:19:18.796 A:middle
in there, start favoriting
toast or looking at toast,

00:19:18.796 --> 00:19:20.806 A:middle
they are taking up
the entire screen.

00:19:21.526 --> 00:19:26.166 A:middle
So what we want is something to
come into focus, grab attention,

00:19:26.476 --> 00:19:28.756 A:middle
but not take over the action.

00:19:29.036 --> 00:19:30.276 A:middle
So we'll just do
something like this.

00:19:31.466 --> 00:19:32.456 A:middle
Okay. Let's see that again.

00:19:33.576 --> 00:19:36.536 A:middle
Okay. So as I said, we
don't have much time,

00:19:36.536 --> 00:19:38.046 A:middle
so we are just going
to keep going.

00:19:38.986 --> 00:19:42.786 A:middle
The second part of the
email asked us to ensure

00:19:42.786 --> 00:19:46.376 A:middle
that people know where their
favorite toast has gone once

00:19:46.376 --> 00:19:47.116 A:middle
they favorited it.

00:19:48.606 --> 00:19:52.336 A:middle
So if people start to
favorite toast, as more

00:19:52.336 --> 00:19:54.286 A:middle
and more new toast is
added to that list,

00:19:54.286 --> 00:19:56.856 A:middle
their favorites are going to
end up way down that list.

00:19:56.976 --> 00:19:58.716 A:middle
They are going to be hard
to find in the future.

00:19:58.716 --> 00:20:02.896 A:middle
What we need is a
place to store a list



00:19:58.716 --> 00:20:02.896 A:middle
What we need is a
place to store a list

00:20:02.996 --> 00:20:04.926 A:middle
of only our favorite toast.

00:20:05.836 --> 00:20:08.536 A:middle
So let's create two buttons
at the bottom of our screen,

00:20:09.116 --> 00:20:12.606 A:middle
one that's going to
show us all of our toast

00:20:12.606 --> 00:20:16.216 A:middle
and the other one that's only
going to show us our favorites

00:20:16.486 --> 00:20:17.276 A:middle
on a different screen.

00:20:18.596 --> 00:20:21.026 A:middle
So when I tap that Favorite
button, it will animate

00:20:21.026 --> 00:20:25.346 A:middle
in from the right and back.

00:20:25.886 --> 00:20:26.816 A:middle
Okay. Great.

00:20:27.636 --> 00:20:29.176 A:middle
So now we've gone
through the process

00:20:29.176 --> 00:20:33.086 A:middle
of designing a simple
structure for our app.

00:20:33.356 --> 00:20:35.106 A:middle
Now, this might feel
like we've done enough,

00:20:35.446 --> 00:20:38.186 A:middle
but we can actually
go one step further.

00:20:39.526 --> 00:20:43.386 A:middle
When someone makes a favorite,
let's use animation to hint

00:20:43.896 --> 00:20:47.186 A:middle
as to where those favorites
have ended up in the app.

00:20:48.506 --> 00:20:53.086 A:middle
So we want a model for
moving toast around our app.

00:20:53.956 --> 00:20:56.986 A:middle
So let's look at how
we might move toast

00:20:56.986 --> 00:20:59.846 A:middle
around in the real world
as a starting point.



00:21:00.406 --> 00:21:07.086 A:middle
So if I was to move toast
from one plate to another,

00:21:07.726 --> 00:21:14.736 A:middle
it wouldn't just disappear and
reappear on the other plate, or,

00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:17.056 A:middle
like, disappear out
of view altogether,

00:21:17.156 --> 00:21:20.486 A:middle
giving me no idea
of where it's gone.

00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:24.576 A:middle
Instead, as we move it,
we can keep track of it

00:21:24.886 --> 00:21:28.816 A:middle
by following its journey
between the plates.

00:21:28.986 --> 00:21:32.916 A:middle
Even when it moves out of sight.

00:21:33.066 --> 00:21:36.046 A:middle
So we can create connections
between different parts

00:21:36.046 --> 00:21:40.456 A:middle
of our app by moving toast
along a path like this.

00:21:41.126 --> 00:21:44.026 A:middle
We can animate this
transition in many ways.

00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:48.126 A:middle
So imagine that the toast gets
swallowed up by a toaster,

00:21:48.426 --> 00:21:50.946 A:middle
spat out along the path, and
ends up in the toast list.

00:21:51.516 --> 00:21:55.626 A:middle
[Applause]

00:21:56.126 --> 00:21:57.876 A:middle
Let's see that one
again, I think.

00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:01.216 A:middle
There we go.



00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:01.216 A:middle
There we go.

00:22:02.766 --> 00:22:06.606 A:middle
Alternatively, we could let
the user define the shape

00:22:06.776 --> 00:22:08.416 A:middle
of that path by allowing them

00:22:08.416 --> 00:22:11.206 A:middle
to track the toast
to the Favorite area.

00:22:12.516 --> 00:22:14.646 A:middle
So we know that favorites
are off to the right.

00:22:16.196 --> 00:22:18.296 A:middle
So the toast could
move out to the right,

00:22:18.686 --> 00:22:20.666 A:middle
get gobbled up, and
then shoot back.

00:22:20.666 --> 00:22:27.106 A:middle
So as we tap the Star
button, it can expand,

00:22:27.106 --> 00:22:31.726 A:middle
swallow up the toast,
pull it over to the right.

00:22:33.126 --> 00:22:34.806 A:middle
Or the entire panel
could move over,

00:22:34.806 --> 00:22:37.736 A:middle
and then we could move
it back when we don't

00:22:37.976 --> 00:22:38.926 A:middle
like that toast anymore.

00:22:39.376 --> 00:22:43.216 A:middle
We have created a lot of
options to choose from.

00:22:43.496 --> 00:22:45.776 A:middle
That's what we are
doing, prototyping

00:22:45.776 --> 00:22:47.446 A:middle
and creating options
for ourselves.

00:22:48.046 --> 00:22:52.036 A:middle
So we created an animation
that draws attention

00:22:52.036 --> 00:22:56.486 A:middle
to our new feature, and we
prepared an animation that hints

00:22:56.586 --> 00:22:57.966 A:middle
at the structure of our app.

00:22:59.096 --> 00:23:03.076 A:middle
But the CEO wants people to
be able to use the button



00:22:59.096 --> 00:23:03.076 A:middle
But the CEO wants people to
be able to use the button

00:23:03.236 --> 00:23:06.826 A:middle
from the first touch, and in
order to do that, we are going

00:23:06.826 --> 00:23:11.486 A:middle
to think about how
animation responds to touch.

00:23:11.706 --> 00:23:15.166 A:middle
But we can begin one step
before that by looking

00:23:15.166 --> 00:23:18.426 A:middle
at how animation can suggest
how to interact with a piece

00:23:18.426 --> 00:23:21.546 A:middle
of toast before you've
even touched it.

00:23:22.436 --> 00:23:24.216 A:middle
So on the Lock screen here,

00:23:24.586 --> 00:23:26.516 A:middle
we can see an animated
highlight move

00:23:26.516 --> 00:23:28.746 A:middle
across the words
"Slide to Unlock."

00:23:29.856 --> 00:23:31.456 A:middle
There's meaning in
this movement.

00:23:32.076 --> 00:23:34.076 A:middle
It travels in the direction
you are meant to swipe.

00:23:34.976 --> 00:23:38.136 A:middle
It offers a subtle cue to
encourage the users to act

00:23:38.136 --> 00:23:39.336 A:middle
on it in a specific way.

00:23:40.596 --> 00:23:42.756 A:middle
It's elegantly foreshadowing
the interaction.

00:23:43.306 --> 00:23:48.746 A:middle
Let's see if we can create an
animation that hints to the user

00:23:48.746 --> 00:23:50.166 A:middle
that they should
tap this button.

00:23:51.316 --> 00:23:52.606 A:middle
So we will zoom in again.

00:23:53.216 --> 00:23:59.256 A:middle
We could move the button down
to hint that it's been pressed.



00:24:00.636 --> 00:24:03.146 A:middle
Or we could animate the shadow

00:24:03.146 --> 00:24:04.736 A:middle
of an imaginary finger
tapping it.

00:24:05.986 --> 00:24:09.966 A:middle
Or we could use a highlight
to give some depth and travel.

00:24:10.516 --> 00:24:12.616 A:middle
Let's just take that
idea quickly and try it

00:24:12.616 --> 00:24:13.786 A:middle
across our entire list.

00:24:14.346 --> 00:24:19.856 A:middle
So it's actually pretty subtle,
so we could add some color

00:24:20.016 --> 00:24:22.046 A:middle
to hint to the user the
change that they will see

00:24:22.126 --> 00:24:23.036 A:middle
when they tap the button.

00:24:24.446 --> 00:24:28.776 A:middle
Okay. So in iOS, you can
actually interact with buttons

00:24:28.776 --> 00:24:31.726 A:middle
and features in many different
ways, and the more complex

00:24:32.036 --> 00:24:34.356 A:middle
and sophisticated
an interaction,

00:24:34.676 --> 00:24:36.426 A:middle
the more foreshadowing
it may need.

00:24:36.676 --> 00:24:39.976 A:middle
But a tap, what we have here,
is actually very simple.

00:24:40.266 --> 00:24:43.176 A:middle
And in this case, it's
probably enough to suggest

00:24:43.176 --> 00:24:46.156 A:middle
that you can act on it
just by it being there,

00:24:46.436 --> 00:24:48.586 A:middle
just through its
presence in the app.

00:24:48.586 --> 00:24:49.736 A:middle
So the simplest option is best.

00:24:49.736 --> 00:24:52.686 A:middle
Let's just reserve
animation for the moment

00:24:52.686 --> 00:24:54.146 A:middle
that you first touch the screen.

00:24:54.666 --> 00:24:59.136 A:middle
So we want some feedback
when you first tap the app.

00:24:59.136 --> 00:25:02.386 A:middle
So let's start by making the
star bigger when you touch down,



00:24:59.136 --> 00:25:02.386 A:middle
So let's start by making the
star bigger when you touch down,

00:25:02.386 --> 00:25:05.916 A:middle
and the moment that you lift
your finger up, let's imagine

00:25:05.916 --> 00:25:08.866 A:middle
that it travels a little way
before bouncing back down.

00:25:09.976 --> 00:25:10.756 A:middle
Okay. That's great.

00:25:10.756 --> 00:25:12.766 A:middle
But what we are going to
do is we are going to need

00:25:12.766 --> 00:25:14.466 A:middle
to get a feel for
this interaction.

00:25:14.686 --> 00:25:17.066 A:middle
So we can do that by
jumping into QuickTime

00:25:17.596 --> 00:25:19.766 A:middle
and screen-grabbing
the animation

00:25:19.766 --> 00:25:20.766 A:middle
that we've just created.

00:25:21.356 --> 00:25:24.716 A:middle
Then what I can do is I
can open up a movie of that

00:25:25.586 --> 00:25:27.566 A:middle
and get a very basic
feel for the interaction

00:25:27.566 --> 00:25:30.646 A:middle
by scrubbing the timeline as
I pretend to touch the button.

00:25:30.646 --> 00:25:34.956 A:middle
So as it scales up, it is
starting to feel a little bit

00:25:34.956 --> 00:25:36.516 A:middle
like it's coming towards me.

00:25:36.516 --> 00:25:38.066 A:middle
So this gives me the impression

00:25:38.066 --> 00:25:39.316 A:middle
that I can actually
drag it around.

00:25:39.316 --> 00:25:40.176 A:middle
Now, why is that?

00:25:40.896 --> 00:25:43.546 A:middle
It kind of reminds
me of something

00:25:43.546 --> 00:25:45.696 A:middle
that we see here
in the Email app.

00:25:47.026 --> 00:25:50.586 A:middle
As I press and hold on a name,
it appears to lift off the page,

00:25:51.066 --> 00:25:53.346 A:middle
which gives me the
sensation I can actually start

00:25:53.346 --> 00:25:54.226 A:middle
to move it around.

00:25:55.136 --> 00:25:57.606 A:middle
This isn't actually
what we are after here,

00:25:58.896 --> 00:26:00.506 A:middle
so when we press
the Favorite button,



00:25:58.896 --> 00:26:00.506 A:middle
so when we press
the Favorite button,

00:26:00.646 --> 00:26:03.926 A:middle
let's make it slightly smaller,
as if it's moving away from you.

00:26:05.006 --> 00:26:06.266 A:middle
And we could also
make it darker.

00:26:06.916 --> 00:26:12.086 A:middle
Okay. It can still bounce up
when we've lifted our finger up.

00:26:13.256 --> 00:26:15.206 A:middle
So let's integrate
that with the animation

00:26:15.206 --> 00:26:17.406 A:middle
that we created before,
see how it looks.

00:26:18.566 --> 00:26:25.076 A:middle
So now we are almost ready
to start favoriting toast.

00:26:25.076 --> 00:26:28.686 A:middle
Let's have a look at this.

00:26:28.686 --> 00:26:32.256 A:middle
Great. We have tackled the
three items from the CEO's list,

00:26:32.256 --> 00:26:35.526 A:middle
but we need to get a
feel for these animations

00:26:35.586 --> 00:26:38.016 A:middle
on a device before we
can send it back to him.

00:26:39.146 --> 00:26:44.026 A:middle
So let's head into
Keynote one last time.

00:26:44.236 --> 00:26:47.236 A:middle
We are going to build our
animation at this orientation,

00:26:47.526 --> 00:26:48.586 A:middle
the orientation of the device.

00:26:48.586 --> 00:26:51.966 A:middle
We are going to build our
animations in this format,

00:26:53.236 --> 00:26:56.326 A:middle
and then we are going to load
it onto the phone, open Keynote,

00:26:56.426 --> 00:26:58.836 A:middle
open the file, and
then we can just tap

00:26:58.916 --> 00:26:59.896 A:middle
through the interaction.



00:27:01.656 --> 00:27:05.746 A:middle
So what I'll do is I'll grab
that animation that we created

00:27:06.356 --> 00:27:09.296 A:middle
and some of the assets
that we've created

00:27:09.946 --> 00:27:13.266 A:middle
and the pressing email from
our CEO, and I will send them

00:27:13.266 --> 00:27:15.336 A:middle
over to my colleague,
Marek, who is going

00:27:15.336 --> 00:27:18.926 A:middle
to start integrating some code
to raise everything up a notch.

00:27:19.556 --> 00:27:20.026 A:middle
So, Marek.

00:27:21.516 --> 00:27:24.606 A:middle
[Applause]

00:27:25.106 --> 00:27:27.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; MAREK BEREZA:
Thanks a lot, Joe.

00:27:27.646 --> 00:27:30.736 A:middle
Hi. My name is Marek,
and I spend most

00:27:30.736 --> 00:27:34.606 A:middle
of my time making interactive
prototypes with a little bit

00:27:34.606 --> 00:27:39.836 A:middle
of code, but much less code
than you might imagine.

00:27:39.836 --> 00:27:42.446 A:middle
Now, Joe's just sent
me this Keynote file,

00:27:43.006 --> 00:27:46.356 A:middle
and it's really amazing
how far he's managed to get

00:27:46.356 --> 00:27:48.456 A:middle
without having to write
a single line of code.

00:27:49.236 --> 00:27:53.366 A:middle
But as you know, the CEO of
Toast Modern is on our backs,

00:27:53.516 --> 00:27:55.196 A:middle
so we really need to get
going, and we are going

00:27:55.196 --> 00:27:56.706 A:middle
to do a little bit
of programming

00:27:57.096 --> 00:28:00.366 A:middle
to create an interactive
prototype.



00:27:57.096 --> 00:28:00.366 A:middle
to create an interactive
prototype.

00:28:00.366 --> 00:28:03.506 A:middle
Now, the main reason
to make a prototype is

00:28:03.506 --> 00:28:07.126 A:middle
so that we can get a feel for
these animations in our hand

00:28:07.496 --> 00:28:10.596 A:middle
on the device with the
interactions involved.

00:28:11.586 --> 00:28:14.286 A:middle
And only then can we ask
ourselves the questions:

00:28:15.416 --> 00:28:15.926 A:middle
Does it work?

00:28:17.486 --> 00:28:19.986 A:middle
What doesn't work
about the animation?

00:28:20.516 --> 00:28:23.126 A:middle
And then if it doesn't work,
then why doesn't it work?

00:28:23.766 --> 00:28:30.076 A:middle
So the second reason to make
interactive prototypes is

00:28:30.306 --> 00:28:31.646 A:middle
to let other people try it.

00:28:32.526 --> 00:28:34.556 A:middle
Now, maybe this is even more
important than the first point.

00:28:35.256 --> 00:28:38.466 A:middle
Now, you might be a really
good judge of your animations,

00:28:39.206 --> 00:28:42.576 A:middle
but at the end of the day,
there's just no replacement

00:28:42.576 --> 00:28:43.846 A:middle
for an outsider's opinion.

00:28:44.906 --> 00:28:47.766 A:middle
You, yourself, have got a
strong emotional investment

00:28:47.766 --> 00:28:48.326 A:middle
in your app.

00:28:48.326 --> 00:28:50.346 A:middle
You spent loads of
time working on it.

00:28:51.096 --> 00:28:54.506 A:middle
So really, you need to find
someone who isn't invested,

00:28:54.726 --> 00:28:56.856 A:middle
someone who doesn't know what
these animations are supposed

00:28:56.916 --> 00:29:00.266 A:middle
to say, and see if they get it.



00:28:56.916 --> 00:29:00.266 A:middle
to say, and see if they get it.

00:29:00.266 --> 00:29:02.356 A:middle
I just quickly want to
go back to this diagram

00:29:02.356 --> 00:29:06.136 A:middle
that Julian showed earlier,
this cycle of making something,

00:29:06.566 --> 00:29:09.926 A:middle
showing someone, and then
learning from their feedback.

00:29:10.256 --> 00:29:12.696 A:middle
It's really important to
take what you've learned

00:29:12.696 --> 00:29:15.266 A:middle
and put it back into
the making process

00:29:15.506 --> 00:29:20.306 A:middle
so you can keep iterating
until you get it right.

00:29:20.566 --> 00:29:23.916 A:middle
Now, the third reason is so
that you can make changes

00:29:24.146 --> 00:29:24.966 A:middle
really easily.

00:29:25.666 --> 00:29:27.366 A:middle
If you try doing
this sort of stuff

00:29:27.366 --> 00:29:29.106 A:middle
with production-style code,

00:29:29.516 --> 00:29:31.616 A:middle
you end up writing
quite a lot of code.

00:29:31.616 --> 00:29:34.836 A:middle
And then when you want to make a
small change, you end up having

00:29:34.836 --> 00:29:37.296 A:middle
to scrap a lot of code and
then write a lot more code.

00:29:37.906 --> 00:29:41.476 A:middle
So if you make these little
interactive prototypes,

00:29:41.886 --> 00:29:45.366 A:middle
then you end up saving yourself
a lot of time and money.

00:29:46.626 --> 00:29:49.536 A:middle
Now, what are these
interactive prototype things?

00:29:50.336 --> 00:29:53.156 A:middle
Well, essentially, we are
going to build an app,

00:29:53.156 --> 00:29:56.966 A:middle
but we are going to cut as
many corners as we possibly can

00:29:57.306 --> 00:30:00.746 A:middle
to create the illusion
of a fully fledged app



00:29:57.306 --> 00:30:00.746 A:middle
to create the illusion
of a fully fledged app

00:30:00.956 --> 00:30:02.396 A:middle
so we can test out
our animations.

00:30:03.626 --> 00:30:07.076 A:middle
The easiest way that I can
think to do this is rather

00:30:07.076 --> 00:30:09.116 A:middle
than using navigation
controllers

00:30:09.116 --> 00:30:10.906 A:middle
and all these UI controls,

00:30:11.276 --> 00:30:13.856 A:middle
we are just going
to work with images.

00:30:14.526 --> 00:30:17.616 A:middle
So I've taken a few
screenshots from Joe's Keynote.

00:30:18.056 --> 00:30:21.766 A:middle
We've got one picture of
the main app with that row

00:30:21.766 --> 00:30:23.486 A:middle
that we are going to
make interactive missing.

00:30:24.326 --> 00:30:26.056 A:middle
We've got one picture of the row

00:30:26.056 --> 00:30:27.866 A:middle
that we are going
to make interactive.

00:30:28.476 --> 00:30:31.286 A:middle
And then that same row,
the favorited version.

00:30:32.306 --> 00:30:34.546 A:middle
And this is what
our code looks like.

00:30:34.856 --> 00:30:35.596 A:middle
It's very rough.

00:30:36.486 --> 00:30:38.216 A:middle
We've got three lines of code

00:30:38.376 --> 00:30:40.316 A:middle
to load those three
images we just saw.

00:30:41.426 --> 00:30:44.756 A:middle
This block of code adds
those images as subviews

00:30:44.826 --> 00:30:47.476 A:middle
to our main view and
puts them into place.

00:30:48.286 --> 00:30:50.876 A:middle
Then this block of code
listens for a touch event,

00:30:50.876 --> 00:30:52.376 A:middle
and when it gets a touch event,

00:30:52.846 --> 00:30:56.036 A:middle
it animates that favorites row
off to the right-hand side,

00:30:56.036 --> 00:31:00.386 A:middle
and then it brings the favorited
version of the row from behind.



00:30:56.036 --> 00:31:00.386 A:middle
and then it brings the favorited
version of the row from behind.

00:31:01.696 --> 00:31:04.296 A:middle
So running it on the phone
looks something like this.

00:31:04.476 --> 00:31:08.466 A:middle
We've got a working prototype,
15 lines of code, 3 pictures.

00:31:08.836 --> 00:31:09.546 A:middle
Couldn't be easier.

00:31:10.616 --> 00:31:14.246 A:middle
We can try it out straightaway,
and as soon as we tried it out,

00:31:14.246 --> 00:31:17.586 A:middle
we discovered something
wrong, and that was

00:31:17.586 --> 00:31:20.966 A:middle
that when we put our finger
down initially, nothing happens.

00:31:21.326 --> 00:31:22.916 A:middle
Joe mentioned something
about this.

00:31:23.756 --> 00:31:26.186 A:middle
When you put your finger
down on most buttons in iOS,

00:31:26.756 --> 00:31:29.456 A:middle
they respond to you, and it's
really important that they do

00:31:29.456 --> 00:31:32.606 A:middle
because it's telling you that
this isn't just a static part

00:31:32.606 --> 00:31:34.636 A:middle
of the screen, it's
an interactive thing.

00:31:35.196 --> 00:31:40.356 A:middle
In order to dig into
this problem deeper,

00:31:40.356 --> 00:31:45.006 A:middle
a really good way to do this is
to break down the interaction.

00:31:45.276 --> 00:31:50.656 A:middle
Most interactions can be
broken down into the stages

00:31:51.066 --> 00:31:58.836 A:middle
of the start, the
change, and the complete.

00:31:58.836 --> 00:32:04.906 A:middle
And each of these stages
is an opportunity for you



00:31:58.836 --> 00:32:04.906 A:middle
And each of these stages
is an opportunity for you

00:32:05.036 --> 00:32:10.596 A:middle
to help guide the user on their
way through the interaction.

00:32:10.736 --> 00:32:12.336 A:middle
Now let's think of
this in terms of touch.

00:32:13.576 --> 00:32:17.656 A:middle
We've got the start, which
might be our touchdown.

00:32:18.386 --> 00:32:21.456 A:middle
We've got the change,
which is moving your finger

00:32:21.456 --> 00:32:22.346 A:middle
across the screen.

00:32:22.346 --> 00:32:25.546 A:middle
And then the complete, when you
lift your finger off the screen.

00:32:25.546 --> 00:32:29.846 A:middle
And in programming, we
think of touches began,

00:32:30.166 --> 00:32:32.196 A:middle
touches moved, and
touches ended.

00:32:32.196 --> 00:32:35.566 A:middle
Now let's go back to
our Favorites button.

00:32:35.866 --> 00:32:39.646 A:middle
So as the finger goes down, we
need to respond to the user.

00:32:40.316 --> 00:32:42.206 A:middle
Maybe we can just
make that star grow

00:32:42.206 --> 00:32:44.556 A:middle
or do something a little
bit more intelligent

00:32:44.706 --> 00:32:46.206 A:middle
as to what Joe is talking about.

00:32:47.526 --> 00:32:49.676 A:middle
Now, moving your finger
around on a button,

00:32:50.116 --> 00:32:52.756 A:middle
maybe if the user moves
their finger off the button,

00:32:53.106 --> 00:32:55.016 A:middle
we can allow them to move out --

00:32:55.016 --> 00:32:59.066 A:middle
I mean, to back out of what
the action is going to do.

00:32:59.066 --> 00:33:03.026 A:middle
So maybe for the animation,
we just reverse that animation



00:32:59.066 --> 00:33:03.026 A:middle
So maybe for the animation,
we just reverse that animation

00:33:03.306 --> 00:33:04.366 A:middle
to go back to the start

00:33:04.366 --> 00:33:07.906 A:middle
to reassure the user
nothing is going to happen.

00:33:07.906 --> 00:33:09.896 A:middle
And then finally,
the complete stage.

00:33:10.306 --> 00:33:11.746 A:middle
If they want to complete,

00:33:12.196 --> 00:33:16.346 A:middle
we have to make sure we reward
the user, make sure they know

00:33:16.346 --> 00:33:19.316 A:middle
that they favorited the toast.

00:33:19.316 --> 00:33:22.896 A:middle
So I am not going to go through
every single line of code here

00:33:22.896 --> 00:33:24.246 A:middle
because it's a little
bit longer,

00:33:24.246 --> 00:33:27.066 A:middle
and also my code is
a little bit messy,

00:33:27.066 --> 00:33:28.976 A:middle
and I guess that's the
point that I want to get

00:33:28.976 --> 00:33:32.736 A:middle
across is the fact that this
is not an engineering exercise.

00:33:33.666 --> 00:33:36.396 A:middle
We really just want you
to hack it together.

00:33:36.436 --> 00:33:37.716 A:middle
I give you my full permission.

00:33:39.086 --> 00:33:43.736 A:middle
And secondly, really try and
use images wherever you can.

00:33:43.736 --> 00:33:45.436 A:middle
You will be amazed at
what you can get away

00:33:45.436 --> 00:33:47.206 A:middle
with with this sort of fakery.

00:33:47.206 --> 00:33:50.746 A:middle
And then thirdly, there
is a really nice suite

00:33:50.896 --> 00:33:53.456 A:middle
of animation functions, which
you probably already know,

00:33:53.456 --> 00:33:57.316 A:middle
which is Animate with
Duration in the UIView class.

00:33:57.616 --> 00:33:59.416 A:middle
So here's our prototype.

00:33:59.676 --> 00:34:01.886 A:middle
We've got something we can
get someone to try out.



00:33:59.676 --> 00:34:01.886 A:middle
We've got something we can
get someone to try out.

00:34:02.536 --> 00:34:04.306 A:middle
So let's try it out on others.

00:34:04.306 --> 00:34:09.985 A:middle
So I took it to my next-door
neighbor, which coincidentally,

00:34:09.985 --> 00:34:12.036 A:middle
he's a massive toast fan,

00:34:12.036 --> 00:34:13.795 A:middle
so he was really
excited to try it out.

00:34:13.795 --> 00:34:18.295 A:middle
And he came back
with some concise

00:34:18.716 --> 00:34:20.116 A:middle
but very revealing feedback.

00:34:20.116 --> 00:34:24.626 A:middle
And that was, I really liked
how it felt, but surely,

00:34:24.726 --> 00:34:25.746 A:middle
shouldn't it be a swipe?

00:34:26.856 --> 00:34:28.716 A:middle
Now, he's got a point here.

00:34:28.716 --> 00:34:30.706 A:middle
The animation even
goes off to the right.

00:34:30.706 --> 00:34:31.846 A:middle
It looks like a swipe.

00:34:31.846 --> 00:34:34.126 A:middle
And this is a really
good example

00:34:34.126 --> 00:34:37.516 A:middle
of how your outsider's opinion
can really give you these

00:34:37.516 --> 00:34:40.926 A:middle
insights of things that, in
hindsight, are really obvious,

00:34:40.926 --> 00:34:44.005 A:middle
but we just didn't see
it because we were too

00:34:44.186 --> 00:34:46.545 A:middle
in the process of the project.

00:34:46.896 --> 00:34:51.706 A:middle
So maybe he is alluding to
this nice animation in Mail

00:34:51.706 --> 00:34:54.255 A:middle
where you can swipe
to mark as Unread.

00:34:54.856 --> 00:34:57.036 A:middle
So let's try a swipe gesture.

00:34:57.616 --> 00:34:59.986 A:middle
Let's think of it in
terms of our start,



00:35:00.146 --> 00:35:01.686 A:middle
change, and complete model.

00:35:02.316 --> 00:35:05.696 A:middle
So in the start, we've
got the finger going down.

00:35:05.696 --> 00:35:07.916 A:middle
As the finger goes down, we need

00:35:07.916 --> 00:35:10.066 A:middle
to determine whether the
user is trying to swipe

00:35:10.506 --> 00:35:12.926 A:middle
or whether they want
to scroll or just tap.

00:35:12.926 --> 00:35:16.396 A:middle
And the way we do this
really easily is we just look

00:35:16.396 --> 00:35:18.176 A:middle
at the initial movement
of the finger,

00:35:18.176 --> 00:35:22.346 A:middle
and if it moves far
enough horizontally

00:35:22.346 --> 00:35:24.336 A:middle
without moving too
much vertically,

00:35:24.756 --> 00:35:25.676 A:middle
we know it's a swipe.

00:35:26.136 --> 00:35:28.776 A:middle
So essentially, we are
setting some sort of threshold.

00:35:29.586 --> 00:35:31.346 A:middle
And only once a user has passed

00:35:31.666 --> 00:35:34.686 A:middle
that threshold do we start
this connected behavior.

00:35:36.146 --> 00:35:38.296 A:middle
So now we are in
the change state,

00:35:38.296 --> 00:35:40.046 A:middle
where the user can
move this row.

00:35:40.726 --> 00:35:44.426 A:middle
Maybe we can prompt them
with a little message saying

00:35:44.426 --> 00:35:45.796 A:middle
if they carry on swiping,

00:35:45.796 --> 00:35:47.736 A:middle
then they are going
to favorite this row.

00:35:49.876 --> 00:35:52.556 A:middle
And so hopefully
intuitively they get the idea

00:35:52.556 --> 00:35:54.046 A:middle
that they can back
out at this stage

00:35:54.086 --> 00:35:57.346 A:middle
by letting go or by moving back.

00:35:57.346 --> 00:35:59.776 A:middle
So this is what it would
look like on the phone.

00:35:59.776 --> 00:36:03.096 A:middle
And then finally, the complete.



00:35:59.776 --> 00:36:03.096 A:middle
And then finally, the complete.

00:36:03.506 --> 00:36:07.236 A:middle
If the user carries on swiping,
we need to make sure, again,

00:36:07.296 --> 00:36:10.976 A:middle
they know that they
favorited this row.

00:36:10.976 --> 00:36:12.596 A:middle
So we've got our prototype.

00:36:12.706 --> 00:36:14.676 A:middle
I tried it out on my
next-door neighbor.

00:36:14.816 --> 00:36:16.876 A:middle
He seemed to really
like it, maybe partly

00:36:16.876 --> 00:36:20.426 A:middle
because it was his idea
in the first place.

00:36:20.426 --> 00:36:23.236 A:middle
And we are ready to
send it off to the CEO

00:36:23.456 --> 00:36:25.016 A:middle
to see what he thinks.

00:36:25.576 --> 00:36:29.886 A:middle
So he's usually quite quick
at getting back to us.

00:36:30.246 --> 00:36:31.926 A:middle
[Ding] Oh, there he is.

00:36:32.676 --> 00:36:34.016 A:middle
Hi, Marek.

00:36:34.016 --> 00:36:36.876 A:middle
Thirty seconds ago I decided to
turn my life around and switch

00:36:36.876 --> 00:36:39.896 A:middle
to a gluten-free paleo diet.

00:36:40.496 --> 00:36:42.056 A:middle
I feel better already.

00:36:42.116 --> 00:36:45.606 A:middle
The future is drinkable
meal replacements.

00:36:46.486 --> 00:36:49.146 A:middle
Now I don't even need to
leave my standing desk to eat.

00:36:49.816 --> 00:36:52.706 A:middle
I need a prototype
in 45 minutes.

00:36:52.706 --> 00:36:54.116 A:middle
Have a great weekend.

00:36:54.116 --> 00:36:56.166 A:middle
So of course, I am going
to have a great weekend.

00:36:57.246 --> 00:36:59.456 A:middle
Anyway, that's interactive
prototypes.



00:37:00.096 --> 00:37:03.576 A:middle
Hopefully now you can see
that it's really easy to test

00:37:03.576 --> 00:37:06.506 A:middle
out your animations before
you build out your whole app

00:37:06.726 --> 00:37:09.656 A:middle
so that later on down the line
you are not going to get burnt.

00:37:09.656 --> 00:37:12.006 A:middle
I'm going to hand
you back to Julian

00:37:12.006 --> 00:37:13.666 A:middle
for a quick toast
mortem of the session.

00:37:14.516 --> 00:37:17.016 A:middle
[Applause]

00:37:17.516 --> 00:37:18.636 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JULIAN MISSIG:
Thank you, Marek.

00:37:19.246 --> 00:37:19.746 A:middle
Thank you, Marek.

00:37:21.246 --> 00:37:25.006 A:middle
So what did we learn
today about animation?

00:37:25.006 --> 00:37:29.996 A:middle
We learned that we can think of
animation as a change over time.

00:37:31.246 --> 00:37:35.636 A:middle
We still need to go back
and design our screens,

00:37:35.676 --> 00:37:38.196 A:middle
figure out what should be
on each screen if we run

00:37:38.196 --> 00:37:39.636 A:middle
into difficulty with
our animations.

00:37:41.516 --> 00:37:44.916 A:middle
The manner in which you change
over time can be thought

00:37:44.916 --> 00:37:46.076 A:middle
of in two different ways.

00:37:46.606 --> 00:37:49.016 A:middle
It's both practical, it
communicates something

00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:51.436 A:middle
about how all the different
parts of your app fit together.

00:37:52.106 --> 00:37:52.956 A:middle
And it's artful.

00:37:53.476 --> 00:37:55.566 A:middle
It tells you something
about the character

00:37:55.566 --> 00:37:59.056 A:middle
of your app, how it feels.



00:38:00.196 --> 00:38:04.326 A:middle
We have three different reasons
why we might want to animate.

00:38:04.326 --> 00:38:06.286 A:middle
We can animate to direct
people's attention.

00:38:07.446 --> 00:38:09.686 A:middle
We can animate to help
keep people oriented.

00:38:09.686 --> 00:38:13.936 A:middle
And we can animate to
connect people's behavior

00:38:13.936 --> 00:38:18.426 A:middle
to what's happening on screen.

00:38:19.116 --> 00:38:22.876 A:middle
We briefly touched on this
prototyping process we've

00:38:23.136 --> 00:38:26.156 A:middle
described a couple of times
where we want to make a lot

00:38:26.156 --> 00:38:28.916 A:middle
of things so that we can
show people a lot of things,

00:38:29.336 --> 00:38:30.566 A:middle
so we can learn a lot of things.

00:38:31.646 --> 00:38:32.656 A:middle
The more that we can do this,

00:38:32.726 --> 00:38:35.506 A:middle
the more that we can learn
before we invest time and money

00:38:35.766 --> 00:38:37.736 A:middle
in building the real apps.

00:38:38.456 --> 00:38:42.076 A:middle
If you would like to learn more
about this prototyping process,

00:38:43.196 --> 00:38:47.096 A:middle
there was a session at last
year's WWDC specifically

00:38:47.096 --> 00:38:47.886 A:middle
on prototyping.

00:38:48.806 --> 00:38:50.916 A:middle
And yesterday, there
was a session Designing

00:38:50.916 --> 00:38:53.646 A:middle
for Future Hardware, that
applies this prototyping process

00:38:54.156 --> 00:38:55.736 A:middle
to apps connected to devices.

00:38:56.446 --> 00:38:58.586 A:middle
Both of these should be
available in videos online.

00:38:59.706 --> 00:39:00.696 A:middle
You should certainly also check



00:38:59.706 --> 00:39:00.696 A:middle
You should certainly also check

00:39:00.696 --> 00:39:03.876 A:middle
out all the other design
sessions for more information

00:39:03.876 --> 00:39:08.076 A:middle
on how you can be
designing all these screens.

00:39:09.726 --> 00:39:13.706 A:middle
But finally, we would like to
leave you with just one thought.

00:39:15.316 --> 00:39:20.876 A:middle
We want you to go out there and
use animation to add character

00:39:21.126 --> 00:39:22.076 A:middle
to your apps and games.

00:39:24.406 --> 00:39:28.986 A:middle
But please do so thoughtfully.

00:39:30.416 --> 00:39:31.716 A:middle
The whole point of this is

00:39:31.716 --> 00:39:36.356 A:middle
that we can't understand what
the animation communicates

00:39:37.066 --> 00:39:39.556 A:middle
or how it feels without
trying it.

00:39:40.386 --> 00:39:43.336 A:middle
So find ways to try animations,
whatever those ways may be.

00:39:43.946 --> 00:39:44.386 A:middle
Thank you all.

00:39:45.516 --> 00:39:49.500 A:middle
[Applause]
