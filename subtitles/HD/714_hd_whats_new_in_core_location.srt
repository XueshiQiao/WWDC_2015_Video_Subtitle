00:00:26.516 --> 00:00:31.676 A:middle
[Applause]

00:00:32.176 --> 00:00:34.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; ADAM DRISCOLL: So good
afternoon and welcome

00:00:34.506 --> 00:00:35.906 A:middle
to What's New In Core Location.

00:00:36.796 --> 00:00:38.656 A:middle
My name is Adam Driscoll,
and I'm an engineer

00:00:38.736 --> 00:00:40.246 A:middle
on the Core Location
frameworks team.

00:00:41.096 --> 00:00:43.346 A:middle
I'm glad to bring this
session to you today

00:00:43.346 --> 00:00:45.336 A:middle
because things are
getting more complicated.

00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:49.416 A:middle
As you know, we have Apple
Watch and iPhone now.

00:00:49.986 --> 00:00:52.906 A:middle
So we thought we would
focus on simplicity.

00:00:52.906 --> 00:00:55.266 A:middle
What can we do to simplify
the tasks for you guys,

00:00:55.306 --> 00:00:57.056 A:middle
and we think we have
good stuff for you today.

00:00:58.216 --> 00:01:00.876 A:middle
Some of you may be
completely new



00:00:58.216 --> 00:01:00.876 A:middle
Some of you may be
completely new

00:01:00.876 --> 00:01:02.086 A:middle
to Core Location as a framework.

00:01:02.086 --> 00:01:05.776 A:middle
I thought I would start out
with an overview of what we do,

00:01:06.246 --> 00:01:09.406 A:middle
the full breadth of our API.

00:01:09.456 --> 00:01:12.526 A:middle
The users know, the people
who buy your apps know

00:01:12.526 --> 00:01:14.836 A:middle
about Core Location,
that they are in charge

00:01:14.916 --> 00:01:17.146 A:middle
of whether you can
use it or not.

00:01:17.146 --> 00:01:19.226 A:middle
You can't access their
location off the bet,

00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:21.726 A:middle
you have to ask permission
and we have the API

00:01:21.726 --> 00:01:23.966 A:middle
that lets you do that.

00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:26.126 A:middle
After that we have
the bread and butter,

00:01:26.126 --> 00:01:27.616 A:middle
which is location updates.

00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:30.786 A:middle
This is the portion of the
API you can use to get access

00:01:30.786 --> 00:01:32.296 A:middle
to where the user
is at that moment.

00:01:33.156 --> 00:01:37.596 A:middle
Starting in iOS 8 we introduced
the ability to do that indoors,

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:41.796 A:middle
maybe in a large venue like
an airport or shopping mall.

00:01:43.616 --> 00:01:45.936 A:middle
Then we have APIs that
we collectively think

00:01:45.936 --> 00:01:47.096 A:middle
of as monitoring APIs.

00:01:47.096 --> 00:01:52.716 A:middle
These are APIs that allow you to
specify an interest in an event

00:01:52.716 --> 00:01:55.246 A:middle
that may happen and
then be launched even

00:01:55.246 --> 00:01:57.016 A:middle
if you are not running
in order to get that,

00:01:57.326 --> 00:01:58.386 A:middle
when that event does happen.

00:01:58.386 --> 00:02:01.736 A:middle
The first of these
is region monitoring.



00:01:58.386 --> 00:02:01.736 A:middle
The first of these
is region monitoring.

00:02:01.736 --> 00:02:03.846 A:middle
This allows you to
specify a geographic region

00:02:04.126 --> 00:02:08.636 A:middle
or iBeacon based region and be
launched into the background

00:02:08.636 --> 00:02:10.636 A:middle
when the user enters
or exits that region.

00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:16.166 A:middle
We have visit monitoring, sort
of a complementary technology

00:02:16.226 --> 00:02:18.086 A:middle
that allows you to
specify that you would

00:02:18.086 --> 00:02:21.536 A:middle
like to be notified whenever
a user arrives or departs

00:02:21.536 --> 00:02:22.846 A:middle
from the place but
you don't have to know

00:02:22.846 --> 00:02:26.346 A:middle
in front what that place is.

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:30.066 A:middle
It's reminders type things,
remind me to get milk when I get

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:32.956 A:middle
to the store and
visiting monitoring is

00:02:32.956 --> 00:02:34.396 A:middle
for diary type things.

00:02:34.436 --> 00:02:39.436 A:middle
I want to know where I
went today and what I did.

00:02:39.436 --> 00:02:42.826 A:middle
We have we have other
APIs, location, geocoding,

00:02:42.876 --> 00:02:48.426 A:middle
I'm not going to
go into it today.

00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:52.506 A:middle
We have improved a number
of these regions of the API,

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:55.606 A:middle
but I want to especially
call out indoor location.

00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:57.536 A:middle
Indoor location is
more accurate.

00:02:58.106 --> 00:03:00.026 A:middle
It's faster at detecting
floor changes.



00:02:58.106 --> 00:03:00.026 A:middle
It's faster at detecting
floor changes.

00:03:00.376 --> 00:03:04.056 A:middle
Most importantly the
sample has been rewritten

00:03:04.056 --> 00:03:06.776 A:middle
to make it more straightforward,
use MapKit.

00:03:07.156 --> 00:03:09.226 A:middle
If you think that
that's relevant

00:03:09.226 --> 00:03:10.516 A:middle
for your users, check it out.

00:03:10.516 --> 00:03:12.176 A:middle
It's should be much
easier for you to use.

00:03:13.346 --> 00:03:17.226 A:middle
For the most part we will be
talking about the first two

00:03:17.226 --> 00:03:22.376 A:middle
of these points, authorization
and location updates.

00:03:22.376 --> 00:03:25.746 A:middle
Specifically, we've
got four parts today

00:03:25.746 --> 00:03:27.936 A:middle
and the first one is
background location.

00:03:28.376 --> 00:03:31.006 A:middle
This is the portion of our
API that you use to record

00:03:31.396 --> 00:03:32.376 A:middle
where the user has gone.

00:03:32.376 --> 00:03:35.526 A:middle
Maybe you have a run tracking
app and they want to have a map

00:03:35.526 --> 00:03:38.176 A:middle
of where they went, or a
navigational app and you want

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:39.916 A:middle
to give them turn
by turn directions.

00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:46.046 A:middle
We have some new API for the
other cases of location use

00:03:46.046 --> 00:03:48.236 A:middle
where you just need to know
where they are right now.

00:03:48.236 --> 00:03:50.746 A:middle
You don't need to be able to
map but want to provide them

00:03:50.746 --> 00:03:52.986 A:middle
with the information about
where the nearest store is,

00:03:53.156 --> 00:03:53.756 A:middle
that kind of thing.

00:03:53.756 --> 00:03:58.356 A:middle
Then we're going to talk about
authorization, how that changed

00:03:58.356 --> 00:04:02.146 A:middle
in iOS 8 and how it applies
now in the Apple Watch era.



00:03:58.356 --> 00:04:02.146 A:middle
in iOS 8 and how it applies
now in the Apple Watch era.

00:04:03.006 --> 00:04:06.066 A:middle
Finally we will dive into
detail on best practices

00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:08.586 A:middle
for Apple Watch, which
hopefully should be very useful

00:04:08.646 --> 00:04:11.246 A:middle
if you're getting started there.

00:04:11.786 --> 00:04:13.786 A:middle
Okay. Background
location updates.

00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:16.046 A:middle
Well, we decided
not to have any.

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:18.026 A:middle
I was just kidding.

00:04:18.386 --> 00:04:20.956 A:middle
This is what the slide would
have looked like in iOS 2 or 3.

00:04:20.956 --> 00:04:25.026 A:middle
If you were a user then,
you remember having

00:04:25.026 --> 00:04:27.596 A:middle
to leave a phone on, unlocked,
in your pocket when you went

00:04:27.596 --> 00:04:28.866 A:middle
for a run if you wanted a map.

00:04:29.156 --> 00:04:31.956 A:middle
Starting in iOS 4 we
improved on this greatly,

00:04:31.956 --> 00:04:36.626 A:middle
with what we call
Background modes.

00:04:36.916 --> 00:04:40.236 A:middle
You still by default will be
running only in the foreground.

00:04:40.486 --> 00:04:45.026 A:middle
However now you can use this
handy capabilities tab in Xcode

00:04:45.496 --> 00:04:48.186 A:middle
that says that you
want to be kept alive

00:04:48.416 --> 00:04:51.076 A:middle
in the background
unsuspended in order

00:04:51.076 --> 00:04:52.416 A:middle
to receive location updates.

00:04:53.686 --> 00:04:59.476 A:middle
What it does, it sets a
value key in your info plist,

00:04:59.476 --> 00:05:02.256 A:middle
statically for the whole app.



00:04:59.476 --> 00:05:02.256 A:middle
statically for the whole app.

00:05:02.256 --> 00:05:05.146 A:middle
The key is UI background modes.

00:05:05.146 --> 00:05:06.836 A:middle
What happens when
this has been done?

00:05:06.836 --> 00:05:08.396 A:middle
We will see a video in a second.

00:05:09.206 --> 00:05:10.696 A:middle
Before we do, let's just see,

00:05:10.696 --> 00:05:12.906 A:middle
let me list out what
to look for.

00:05:13.036 --> 00:05:17.506 A:middle
So it allows you when -- the
user is using your application

00:05:17.506 --> 00:05:19.046 A:middle
to start location updates.

00:05:20.026 --> 00:05:22.086 A:middle
Then let's say the
user gets bored.

00:05:22.086 --> 00:05:26.206 A:middle
Maybe they check out the mail
or their music, a little demo,

00:05:26.206 --> 00:05:28.406 A:middle
maybe they're going to stare
at the home screen for awhile,

00:05:28.886 --> 00:05:29.786 A:middle
but you will be able

00:05:29.786 --> 00:05:33.456 A:middle
to accessing location
during that time.

00:05:33.486 --> 00:05:35.876 A:middle
The user launches you
up and starts you again.

00:05:35.876 --> 00:05:40.136 A:middle
You can stop the session and
stop accessing their location

00:05:40.136 --> 00:05:43.396 A:middle
and thereby stop draining
their battery with the GPS.

00:05:44.046 --> 00:05:46.366 A:middle
So here is the video.

00:05:47.726 --> 00:05:48.846 A:middle
So user launches our app.

00:05:49.466 --> 00:05:51.316 A:middle
There's a button in the
middle there to indicate

00:05:51.316 --> 00:05:53.336 A:middle
that they would like us to
start recording, which we do.

00:05:53.856 --> 00:05:58.756 A:middle
The eye chart, notice that
the numbers are counting up,

00:05:58.876 --> 00:05:59.826 A:middle
what they get to.



00:06:00.036 --> 00:06:01.576 A:middle
The user is going to put
us in the background.

00:06:02.336 --> 00:06:07.796 A:middle
And you see at the top now there
is what we call the Blue Bar.

00:06:08.016 --> 00:06:10.926 A:middle
This indicates that our
sample app is still running.

00:06:11.096 --> 00:06:13.436 A:middle
It gives the user the ability
to tap on it to come back,

00:06:13.566 --> 00:06:14.926 A:middle
which is what they just did.

00:06:15.146 --> 00:06:17.926 A:middle
Notice that the numbers in
the eye chart got bigger,

00:06:18.576 --> 00:06:20.466 A:middle
not bigger in the
eye chart sense.

00:06:21.246 --> 00:06:24.106 A:middle
That indicates that we continue
to receive location updates.

00:06:24.106 --> 00:06:25.956 A:middle
That's just a count of
the ones we've received.

00:06:26.046 --> 00:06:27.776 A:middle
We continue to receive
them in the background.

00:06:28.206 --> 00:06:32.196 A:middle
The user asks us to stop,
we go back to square one.

00:06:33.306 --> 00:06:36.846 A:middle
App developers have
created a lot

00:06:36.846 --> 00:06:38.596 A:middle
of great experiences
off of this.

00:06:39.936 --> 00:06:42.156 A:middle
We are wondering if
there's something we can do

00:06:42.156 --> 00:06:42.746 A:middle
to improve it.

00:06:42.746 --> 00:06:44.446 A:middle
Is there room for
improvement here?

00:06:45.406 --> 00:06:51.336 A:middle
With the particular theme of
simplification, you'll notice

00:06:51.336 --> 00:06:54.266 A:middle
that once your application has
opted into this capability,

00:06:54.576 --> 00:06:57.536 A:middle
it has responsibility because
if you continue running

00:06:57.536 --> 00:07:00.986 A:middle
in the background, the user
may not know this is happening



00:06:57.536 --> 00:07:00.986 A:middle
in the background, the user
may not know this is happening

00:07:00.986 --> 00:07:05.076 A:middle
and you could accidentally
use up either through a bug

00:07:05.076 --> 00:07:07.726 A:middle
or through a corner case in
your UI you could use up a lot

00:07:07.726 --> 00:07:09.336 A:middle
of battery without their intent.

00:07:09.336 --> 00:07:13.666 A:middle
We think of that as high stakes
and we want to lower those,

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:16.556 A:middle
so that the consequence of a bug

00:07:16.556 --> 00:07:19.066 A:middle
or an unexpected
circumstance are lower.

00:07:20.296 --> 00:07:23.176 A:middle
Another thing that you have
to do right now that we would

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:25.846 A:middle
like to improve is, you
have to be closely coupled

00:07:25.956 --> 00:07:30.296 A:middle
to the transitions that your app
goes through when it is entering

00:07:30.296 --> 00:07:32.176 A:middle
and exiting the foreground.

00:07:32.176 --> 00:07:35.146 A:middle
Once you opted in to begin
running and using user location

00:07:35.146 --> 00:07:37.706 A:middle
in the background, you have to
tell us you are not interested

00:07:37.706 --> 00:07:39.166 A:middle
to when you do go
to the background.

00:07:39.166 --> 00:07:42.026 A:middle
You only find out you are going

00:07:42.026 --> 00:07:44.546 A:middle
to the background
until after the fact.

00:07:44.546 --> 00:07:49.536 A:middle
That leads to this view that
we have in the video here

00:07:49.536 --> 00:07:50.986 A:middle
that you may have seen
in your app as well.

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:55.066 A:middle
We modified the sample so
that it stops location updates

00:07:55.126 --> 00:07:56.706 A:middle
in the delegate callback
to indicate

00:07:56.706 --> 00:07:58.666 A:middle
that it went to the background.

00:07:58.666 --> 00:08:01.656 A:middle
The Blue Bar appears
briefly and then disappears.



00:07:58.666 --> 00:08:01.656 A:middle
The Blue Bar appears
briefly and then disappears.

00:08:02.746 --> 00:08:05.456 A:middle
That can be kind of
confusing to users.

00:08:05.456 --> 00:08:07.926 A:middle
You notice that the unifying
characteristic here is you

00:08:08.436 --> 00:08:10.326 A:middle
signed up for the
ability to check,

00:08:10.326 --> 00:08:13.096 A:middle
to access the user's location
in a continuous manner

00:08:13.096 --> 00:08:16.906 A:middle
in the background, but
that was done on a kind

00:08:16.906 --> 00:08:19.496 A:middle
of carte blanche basis for
your whole app forever.

00:08:19.776 --> 00:08:22.536 A:middle
In fact you only want to
do it at certain times,

00:08:22.536 --> 00:08:24.536 A:middle
only when the user is
actively using your app

00:08:24.536 --> 00:08:25.116 A:middle
in the background.

00:08:25.986 --> 00:08:30.836 A:middle
Starting in iOS 9 we have a new
API that helps you express that.

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:33.186 A:middle
It's called allows
background location updates,

00:08:33.186 --> 00:08:36.535 A:middle
and it's a property you set
on your location manager.

00:08:36.936 --> 00:08:39.946 A:middle
If you have multiple location
managers, you have to set it

00:08:39.946 --> 00:08:41.796 A:middle
on each one when appropriate.

00:08:41.856 --> 00:08:45.096 A:middle
You can have it set differently
on different location managers.

00:08:45.836 --> 00:08:46.646 A:middle
What does it do?

00:08:46.796 --> 00:08:48.806 A:middle
Well, you set this
property to yes.

00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:52.326 A:middle
Then it kind of opts
you into this behavior

00:08:52.326 --> 00:08:55.806 A:middle
that you requested
in your info plist.

00:08:55.806 --> 00:08:58.046 A:middle
If you said you like the
capability in the background,

00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:01.076 A:middle
you set this to yes and
start the location updates,



00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:01.076 A:middle
you set this to yes and
start the location updates,

00:09:01.216 --> 00:09:03.146 A:middle
you will be kept
running in the background

00:09:03.146 --> 00:09:04.996 A:middle
to receive those
location updates.

00:09:05.606 --> 00:09:09.306 A:middle
However if you set it
to no, you will not.

00:09:10.446 --> 00:09:12.926 A:middle
Okay. Crucial question then:
What is the default value?

00:09:13.066 --> 00:09:14.746 A:middle
How do we know when to set this?

00:09:14.746 --> 00:09:17.316 A:middle
The default value is no.

00:09:17.916 --> 00:09:19.306 A:middle
So I want to reiterate this.

00:09:19.506 --> 00:09:21.026 A:middle
The default value here is no.

00:09:21.026 --> 00:09:24.286 A:middle
If you have an application
that runs for purposes

00:09:24.286 --> 00:09:26.336 A:middle
of recording location
tracks in the background

00:09:26.416 --> 00:09:27.756 A:middle
or for navigational purposes,

00:09:28.186 --> 00:09:30.766 A:middle
you must make a change
when you adopt iOS 9.

00:09:31.346 --> 00:09:32.786 A:middle
You have to go into
the app and find

00:09:32.786 --> 00:09:36.046 A:middle
where the user is indicating
that they want you to do this,

00:09:36.046 --> 00:09:38.076 A:middle
really want you to record a
session in the background.

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:40.916 A:middle
Set this property to yes on
the location manager there.

00:09:41.586 --> 00:09:44.796 A:middle
When they finish,
set it back to no.

00:09:45.206 --> 00:09:47.576 A:middle
Once you've done that, however,
you no longer have to worry

00:09:47.576 --> 00:09:48.886 A:middle
about transitions
to the foreground

00:09:48.886 --> 00:09:51.356 A:middle
and background in
an immediate case.

00:09:51.356 --> 00:09:53.986 A:middle
You don't have to rush to turn
off location updates when you go

00:09:53.986 --> 00:09:56.346 A:middle
to the background because you
are already configured either

00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:59.836 A:middle
to continue or not
continue as you go.



00:10:00.616 --> 00:10:03.286 A:middle
Okay. So must change
if you have an app

00:10:03.356 --> 00:10:05.376 A:middle
that uses background
location updates.

00:10:05.376 --> 00:10:06.656 A:middle
What is the compatibility story?

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:10.026 A:middle
Will the apps in
the Store be broken?

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:14.596 A:middle
No, we grandfathered in all the
apps in the Store, but you need

00:10:14.596 --> 00:10:17.216 A:middle
to make this change as soon
as you adopt iOS 9 SDK.

00:10:17.786 --> 00:10:22.576 A:middle
What if you want to
support users not

00:10:22.576 --> 00:10:25.486 A:middle
on the latest and greatest iOS?

00:10:25.486 --> 00:10:27.116 A:middle
Maybe they're still
running iOS 8.

00:10:27.936 --> 00:10:30.016 A:middle
You can do that in
the standard fashion,

00:10:30.016 --> 00:10:34.326 A:middle
set a minimum deployment target
on your app and check at runtime

00:10:34.326 --> 00:10:35.896 A:middle
with response to selector to see

00:10:35.896 --> 00:10:37.236 A:middle
if the location manager
you are running

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:40.526 A:middle
against currently has
this property or not.

00:10:41.056 --> 00:10:43.456 A:middle
And that's what it looks
like in Objective-C,

00:10:43.456 --> 00:10:45.466 A:middle
the response to selector
in Swift.

00:10:45.466 --> 00:10:48.056 A:middle
We have a fancy new
pound available

00:10:48.056 --> 00:10:49.636 A:middle
in Swift in response to this.

00:10:50.376 --> 00:10:53.426 A:middle
If you are at runtime
with a location manager

00:10:53.426 --> 00:10:56.336 A:middle
that has knowledge of this
property, you can set it to yes.

00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:58.906 A:middle
Otherwise you can assume
it's already set to yes

00:10:58.996 --> 00:10:59.846 A:middle
and you don't have to set it.



00:11:00.286 --> 00:11:02.036 A:middle
Unfortunately, that means
you can't set it to no

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:03.146 A:middle
for extra protection either.

00:11:04.456 --> 00:11:08.546 A:middle
Okay. Brief sidebar
because I know many of you

00:11:08.546 --> 00:11:10.736 A:middle
who are interested in
background location updates

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:13.566 A:middle
of this kind also may
have audible cues.

00:11:13.976 --> 00:11:17.376 A:middle
Probably the go-to way to
communicate with the user

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:20.866 A:middle
when they have their
phone in their arm band

00:11:20.866 --> 00:11:25.266 A:middle
or mounted on their dash.

00:11:25.266 --> 00:11:29.146 A:middle
Starting in iOS 9, the core
audio team introduced this new,

00:11:29.236 --> 00:11:30.736 A:middle
very long-named option.

00:11:31.216 --> 00:11:34.386 A:middle
What this can, you use
this option in order

00:11:34.386 --> 00:11:35.936 A:middle
to indicate you are
going to do spoken output

00:11:36.286 --> 00:11:40.166 A:middle
and the system can mix you with
other output that the user has,

00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:44.156 A:middle
so you are not garbled
but you do mix with music.

00:11:45.076 --> 00:11:47.516 A:middle
Check out What's
New In Core Audio.

00:11:47.886 --> 00:11:53.816 A:middle
It happened yesterday, if
this is appropriate for you.

00:11:53.816 --> 00:11:54.736 A:middle
Background location.

00:11:55.576 --> 00:11:57.656 A:middle
What about those times
when you don't need

00:11:57.656 --> 00:12:00.806 A:middle
to access the user's location
in a continuous fashion?



00:11:57.656 --> 00:12:00.806 A:middle
to access the user's location
in a continuous fashion?

00:12:01.126 --> 00:12:02.276 A:middle
You are not building
a map for them.

00:12:02.276 --> 00:12:04.746 A:middle
You are trying to
provide them context

00:12:04.746 --> 00:12:07.466 A:middle
for where they are right now.

00:12:07.466 --> 00:12:09.756 A:middle
Starting in iOS 9 we've
introduced a new method

00:12:09.756 --> 00:12:12.126 A:middle
for that called request
location.

00:12:12.916 --> 00:12:16.406 A:middle
It basically automates the
process that you would have had

00:12:16.406 --> 00:12:19.426 A:middle
to do in the past to
accomplish this goal.

00:12:19.866 --> 00:12:22.076 A:middle
If you are experienced
with Core Location,

00:12:22.076 --> 00:12:23.666 A:middle
maybe you know the
drill already.

00:12:24.096 --> 00:12:25.336 A:middle
You start updating location.

00:12:25.366 --> 00:12:29.836 A:middle
You watch those locations
come into your delegate.

00:12:29.836 --> 00:12:32.396 A:middle
You'll notice that they come in
very quickly at first but not

00:12:32.396 --> 00:12:33.766 A:middle
with the best accuracy.

00:12:34.026 --> 00:12:35.916 A:middle
So you need to keep an
eye on the accuracy level.

00:12:35.916 --> 00:12:38.136 A:middle
Figure out when it's good
enough, when it is not going

00:12:38.136 --> 00:12:41.606 A:middle
to get better, pick the
right tradeoff on waiting

00:12:41.606 --> 00:12:44.976 A:middle
and getting converged
accuracy, and use that location,

00:12:44.976 --> 00:12:45.906 A:middle
and then you have to remember

00:12:45.906 --> 00:12:47.676 A:middle
to stop location
updates after that.

00:12:48.406 --> 00:12:51.176 A:middle
We are going to do that
automatically for you.

00:12:51.386 --> 00:12:52.686 A:middle
When you call request location,

00:12:53.056 --> 00:12:55.726 A:middle
we'll start automatically
getting location updates

00:12:55.796 --> 00:12:57.876 A:middle
but we will not give them
to your delegate callback.

00:12:58.136 --> 00:13:01.686 A:middle
We threshold them
internally according



00:12:58.136 --> 00:13:01.686 A:middle
We threshold them
internally according

00:13:01.686 --> 00:13:02.696 A:middle
to your desired accuracy

00:13:02.696 --> 00:13:05.266 A:middle
and then we will call
your delegate back once

00:13:05.266 --> 00:13:06.656 A:middle
with just the location you need.

00:13:07.096 --> 00:13:08.236 A:middle
It will apply our logic

00:13:08.236 --> 00:13:10.366 A:middle
to determine what
the best location is.

00:13:10.926 --> 00:13:13.806 A:middle
We'll automatically stop
location updates for you

00:13:13.806 --> 00:13:17.386 A:middle
at that time so you don't
have any risk of forgetting it

00:13:17.386 --> 00:13:19.696 A:middle
or having a bug there.

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:20.976 A:middle
Okay. So.

00:13:21.516 --> 00:13:25.386 A:middle
[Applause]

00:13:25.886 --> 00:13:28.136 A:middle
I have a little visualization
of how this works

00:13:28.136 --> 00:13:30.776 A:middle
to explain what we are
doing behind the scenes.

00:13:31.036 --> 00:13:32.976 A:middle
You couldn't generate
this by using this API,

00:13:33.156 --> 00:13:35.276 A:middle
because remember we only give
you one delegate callback,

00:13:35.816 --> 00:13:37.766 A:middle
but to see what it looks like.

00:13:38.376 --> 00:13:42.166 A:middle
This ring represents the
desired accuracy that you set.

00:13:42.286 --> 00:13:44.446 A:middle
Think of it as a diameter.

00:13:44.556 --> 00:13:48.006 A:middle
The fixed accuracy that you want
should be tighter than that.

00:13:48.076 --> 00:13:50.316 A:middle
We are just going
to graph it on top

00:13:50.616 --> 00:13:52.656 A:middle
of this map here as
locations come in.

00:13:52.656 --> 00:13:55.346 A:middle
Now, you can see the center
of a location is represented

00:13:55.346 --> 00:13:57.056 A:middle
by a dark circle
that looks like maps.

00:13:57.406 --> 00:13:59.676 A:middle
The accuracy level
is represented

00:13:59.676 --> 00:14:03.006 A:middle
by a larger diameter translucent
circle we about to see.



00:13:59.676 --> 00:14:03.006 A:middle
by a larger diameter translucent
circle we about to see.

00:14:03.316 --> 00:14:05.526 A:middle
See how that changes over time.

00:14:06.666 --> 00:14:09.716 A:middle
The first fix came in quickly
but not terribly accurate.

00:14:10.426 --> 00:14:11.846 A:middle
It gets better over time.

00:14:12.206 --> 00:14:16.556 A:middle
When it gets to a level that's
good enough, we will accept it.

00:14:16.696 --> 00:14:18.896 A:middle
This is the location it will
give to your delegate callback.

00:14:19.456 --> 00:14:20.446 A:middle
All right.

00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:22.706 A:middle
I mentioned this
is configurable,

00:14:22.966 --> 00:14:26.076 A:middle
what your desired accuracy is.

00:14:26.376 --> 00:14:27.646 A:middle
How do you set this?

00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:30.846 A:middle
Fortunately we already have a
property named desired accuracy

00:14:30.896 --> 00:14:31.866 A:middle
on location manager.

00:14:31.866 --> 00:14:33.816 A:middle
You may be familiar with it.

00:14:33.816 --> 00:14:37.276 A:middle
It is how you control what kind
of accuracies you're hoping

00:14:37.276 --> 00:14:38.776 A:middle
for from start updating
location.

00:14:38.776 --> 00:14:41.336 A:middle
It applies also for
request location.

00:14:41.996 --> 00:14:44.246 A:middle
Let's just dial that
down a little bit

00:14:44.246 --> 00:14:46.656 A:middle
and make it very
small, tight accuracy.

00:14:47.156 --> 00:14:49.826 A:middle
And maybe a little
bit too tight.

00:14:49.876 --> 00:14:53.896 A:middle
We'll rerun the simulation
and see what happens.

00:14:53.896 --> 00:14:57.076 A:middle
First fix, we can see
the convergence going on.

00:14:57.076 --> 00:14:58.756 A:middle
Sometimes you have
regressions in convergence.

00:14:59.186 --> 00:15:02.456 A:middle
Overall the trend will be
narrower until you reach kind



00:14:59.186 --> 00:15:02.456 A:middle
Overall the trend will be
narrower until you reach kind

00:15:02.456 --> 00:15:03.366 A:middle
of a break-even point.

00:15:04.226 --> 00:15:08.806 A:middle
At that point, notice we
didn't actually meet the

00:15:09.006 --> 00:15:10.186 A:middle
accuracy criteria.

00:15:10.186 --> 00:15:12.046 A:middle
We got to a point where
we weren't getting better.

00:15:12.046 --> 00:15:14.846 A:middle
At this point we
return this location

00:15:14.846 --> 00:15:15.766 A:middle
to your delegate callback.

00:15:16.736 --> 00:15:19.646 A:middle
Now, that means that the
locations that you receive

00:15:19.646 --> 00:15:20.956 A:middle
after you set a desired accuracy

00:15:20.956 --> 00:15:23.876 A:middle
in your request location may
be either higher accuracy,

00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:25.786 A:middle
that's smaller value
for accuracy,

00:15:26.246 --> 00:15:29.216 A:middle
or they could be lower
depending on how we got them.

00:15:29.216 --> 00:15:30.776 A:middle
Maybe you got lucky
in the first case,

00:15:31.106 --> 00:15:34.216 A:middle
and maybe it's challenging
conditions in the second case.

00:15:35.086 --> 00:15:39.846 A:middle
They get delivered to your
location manager delegate

00:15:40.076 --> 00:15:41.156 A:middle
on this delegate callback,

00:15:41.156 --> 00:15:42.786 A:middle
location manager
updated locations.

00:15:43.206 --> 00:15:45.646 A:middle
Bear in mind that last
parameter is an array.

00:15:45.886 --> 00:15:47.226 A:middle
We only give you one location

00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:49.006 A:middle
so it will be the zero
element in the array.

00:15:49.966 --> 00:15:53.106 A:middle
If the user, on the other
hand, does whatever they do,

00:15:53.106 --> 00:15:55.856 A:middle
if you request location
in an environment

00:15:55.946 --> 00:15:57.896 A:middle
where we can't establish
the user's location,

00:15:57.896 --> 00:16:00.956 A:middle
maybe at the bottom of a
coal mine, we'll call back



00:15:57.896 --> 00:16:00.956 A:middle
maybe at the bottom of a
coal mine, we'll call back

00:16:00.956 --> 00:16:03.076 A:middle
on location manager did
fail with error instead.

00:16:03.726 --> 00:16:04.926 A:middle
So you're guaranteed as long

00:16:04.926 --> 00:16:08.556 A:middle
as you don't interrupt request
location, you will get one

00:16:08.556 --> 00:16:09.966 A:middle
or the other of these
two callbacks

00:16:09.966 --> 00:16:12.056 A:middle
so you can hang some
application logic off

00:16:12.266 --> 00:16:13.486 A:middle
of that if you want to.

00:16:14.016 --> 00:16:16.466 A:middle
And the error that you get

00:16:16.466 --> 00:16:19.806 A:middle
from the error callback is
KCL error location unknown.

00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:23.926 A:middle
Two other things to keep in
mind with request location.

00:16:24.506 --> 00:16:26.146 A:middle
The first is that it's
mutually exclusive

00:16:26.146 --> 00:16:27.356 A:middle
with start updating location.

00:16:27.826 --> 00:16:30.566 A:middle
Since we are using the
same delegate callback,

00:16:30.786 --> 00:16:33.746 A:middle
if you have a start updating
session already going, started

00:16:33.746 --> 00:16:36.576 A:middle
and didn't stop, then a
request location will be simply

00:16:36.576 --> 00:16:37.086 A:middle
be ignored.

00:16:37.896 --> 00:16:41.026 A:middle
On the other hand if you have
a request location outstanding

00:16:41.026 --> 00:16:43.236 A:middle
but we're still converging, we
haven't settled on a fix for you

00:16:43.236 --> 00:16:47.296 A:middle
yet and you call start
updating, that will take over

00:16:47.296 --> 00:16:49.456 A:middle
and the request will be canceled

00:16:49.536 --> 00:16:51.176 A:middle
and you'll start
getting regular updates

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:52.036 A:middle
to the delegate callback.

00:16:52.676 --> 00:16:54.016 A:middle
Mutually exclusive.

00:16:54.016 --> 00:16:55.236 A:middle
You can have only
one at the time,

00:16:55.346 --> 00:16:58.036 A:middle
and start updating location
effectively takes precedence.

00:16:58.636 --> 00:17:01.036 A:middle
The other one is that you can
use stop updating location



00:16:58.636 --> 00:17:01.036 A:middle
The other one is that you can
use stop updating location

00:17:01.036 --> 00:17:03.556 A:middle
in order to cancel a request.

00:17:03.556 --> 00:17:05.536 A:middle
We encourage you to do this
if the user navigates away

00:17:05.536 --> 00:17:08.476 A:middle
from the scope where you had
requested their location.

00:17:09.656 --> 00:17:11.685 A:middle
So you are no longer interested,
we can save some power.

00:17:12.836 --> 00:17:15.856 A:middle
Great. So that's the two APIs
that we have for you today.

00:17:15.856 --> 00:17:18.846 A:middle
The first two of
our overall points.

00:17:18.846 --> 00:17:21.185 A:middle
So now let's talk
about the topic

00:17:21.185 --> 00:17:22.705 A:middle
that probably you are
all very interested in,

00:17:22.705 --> 00:17:24.185 A:middle
you are here to see.

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:25.796 A:middle
That's Apple Watch.

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:30.206 A:middle
So Apple Watch, first thing
to know about any story

00:17:30.206 --> 00:17:32.896 A:middle
about Apple Watch is
that it is really a story

00:17:32.926 --> 00:17:35.986 A:middle
about Apple Watch and iPhone.

00:17:36.186 --> 00:17:38.076 A:middle
So these devices,
they are a pair.

00:17:38.666 --> 00:17:40.866 A:middle
They have a direct one to one
relationship with each other.

00:17:41.266 --> 00:17:45.016 A:middle
We are going to want to
make them cooperate in order

00:17:45.016 --> 00:17:47.166 A:middle
to get the best possible
user experience.

00:17:48.006 --> 00:17:49.036 A:middle
The other thing that sort

00:17:49.036 --> 00:17:52.226 A:middle
of mirrors this situation is
the way you deliver your apps

00:17:52.226 --> 00:17:53.086 A:middle
to users.

00:17:54.036 --> 00:17:57.646 A:middle
You can now write watchOS apps,
but the user doesn't get them

00:17:57.646 --> 00:18:01.326 A:middle
from a watchOS App Store,
but they get them packed



00:17:57.646 --> 00:18:01.326 A:middle
from a watchOS App Store,
but they get them packed

00:18:01.326 --> 00:18:04.086 A:middle
on with the iPhone from
the regular App Store.

00:18:05.376 --> 00:18:10.946 A:middle
When they do that, if they
configured the system to do this

00:18:10.946 --> 00:18:15.376 A:middle
or choose to, iOS will
ship that component

00:18:15.436 --> 00:18:18.246 A:middle
over to the Apple Watch.

00:18:18.246 --> 00:18:21.116 A:middle
The lesson to take from this
is that your watchOS component

00:18:21.116 --> 00:18:23.896 A:middle
and your iPhone component have
a close relationship as well.

00:18:24.326 --> 00:18:27.386 A:middle
From Core Location's
perspective they are one

00:18:27.386 --> 00:18:29.626 A:middle
and the same authorization
identity.

00:18:30.516 --> 00:18:33.616 A:middle
So if you have, whatever kind
of authorization you have,

00:18:33.616 --> 00:18:38.266 A:middle
whatever state you're
in, it applies to both.

00:18:38.796 --> 00:18:41.106 A:middle
Okay. So subtopics on this.

00:18:41.106 --> 00:18:43.016 A:middle
First one, authorization story.

00:18:43.016 --> 00:18:43.786 A:middle
There's some wrinkles.

00:18:43.946 --> 00:18:44.716 A:middle
We'll get into them.

00:18:45.506 --> 00:18:47.386 A:middle
The second one is cooperation.

00:18:47.516 --> 00:18:49.816 A:middle
Now that we have two devices,
two pieces of your app,

00:18:50.256 --> 00:18:53.886 A:middle
how do we get them to work
together and some best practices

00:18:53.886 --> 00:18:55.026 A:middle
to keep the complexity lower.

00:18:55.496 --> 00:18:57.426 A:middle
All right.

00:18:57.846 --> 00:19:00.486 A:middle
Let's do a quick recap
to make sure we're all



00:18:57.846 --> 00:19:00.486 A:middle
Let's do a quick recap
to make sure we're all

00:19:00.566 --> 00:19:02.856 A:middle
on the same ground
with authorization.

00:19:02.856 --> 00:19:04.246 A:middle
Users know they are in charge.

00:19:04.716 --> 00:19:10.186 A:middle
So you ask for permission to
access the user's location,

00:19:10.556 --> 00:19:12.676 A:middle
either by request when
in use authorization

00:19:13.146 --> 00:19:14.826 A:middle
or with request always
authorization.

00:19:15.676 --> 00:19:17.386 A:middle
When in use, always.

00:19:17.446 --> 00:19:20.056 A:middle
These are new terms in iOS 8.

00:19:20.056 --> 00:19:21.216 A:middle
What do they mean?

00:19:21.216 --> 00:19:24.436 A:middle
What, how does your
ability to use location vary

00:19:24.436 --> 00:19:27.006 A:middle
when you use these different
kinds of authorization?

00:19:27.636 --> 00:19:30.246 A:middle
Well, hopefully this table
will help answer that question.

00:19:31.006 --> 00:19:35.386 A:middle
So on iOS we will consider
an app which has requested

00:19:35.386 --> 00:19:38.976 A:middle
when in use authorization and
been granted it and an app

00:19:38.976 --> 00:19:41.436 A:middle
that requested always
authorization

00:19:41.436 --> 00:19:43.546 A:middle
and been granted it.

00:19:43.546 --> 00:19:48.006 A:middle
And so first the three points
you get for signing the test.

00:19:48.376 --> 00:19:51.046 A:middle
If you have either of these
kinds of authorization

00:19:51.046 --> 00:19:53.146 A:middle
and the user is tapping
on your app,

00:19:53.496 --> 00:19:54.896 A:middle
can you access their location?

00:19:55.126 --> 00:19:56.206 A:middle
The answer is yes.

00:19:57.046 --> 00:19:58.856 A:middle
No doubt you already know that.

00:19:59.026 --> 00:20:01.086 A:middle
So what about the slightly
more complicated case



00:19:59.026 --> 00:20:01.086 A:middle
So what about the slightly
more complicated case

00:20:01.086 --> 00:20:02.856 A:middle
where the user has
interacted with your app

00:20:02.856 --> 00:20:04.966 A:middle
and they've indicated they would
like you to track their run

00:20:05.076 --> 00:20:06.746 A:middle
or some other reason
they want you

00:20:06.776 --> 00:20:09.516 A:middle
to continue accessing their
location in the background

00:20:09.786 --> 00:20:10.866 A:middle
in a continuous fashion?

00:20:11.146 --> 00:20:15.416 A:middle
As you may know, you can
do this with both forms

00:20:15.416 --> 00:20:16.426 A:middle
of authorization as well.

00:20:17.236 --> 00:20:21.046 A:middle
However, the behavior you get in
this case is slightly different.

00:20:21.166 --> 00:20:24.076 A:middle
So the Blue Bar that
we noticed is reserved

00:20:24.076 --> 00:20:25.276 A:middle
for when in use apps.

00:20:25.606 --> 00:20:27.686 A:middle
The reason for that is an app
which is authorized for when

00:20:27.686 --> 00:20:30.796 A:middle
in use has an implicit
transactional model

00:20:30.796 --> 00:20:31.796 A:middle
with the user.

00:20:32.126 --> 00:20:34.106 A:middle
The user is expected to know

00:20:34.106 --> 00:20:35.996 A:middle
that you are accessing
their location.

00:20:36.266 --> 00:20:39.326 A:middle
They specifically want you to
do so, as in the case with a run

00:20:39.326 --> 00:20:40.376 A:middle
or navigational session.

00:20:40.736 --> 00:20:43.806 A:middle
We reflect that and also help
them in case they get distracted

00:20:43.806 --> 00:20:45.876 A:middle
and forget, remember
it's ongoing

00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:48.016 A:middle
by displaying the Blue Bar.

00:20:48.016 --> 00:20:50.866 A:middle
They can get back to
the app without scraping

00:20:50.896 --> 00:20:55.866 A:middle
around in the launcher
and find your app.

00:20:56.646 --> 00:20:59.556 A:middle
Okay. So what about the
slightly more complicated case?

00:20:59.726 --> 00:21:02.886 A:middle
Oh, that doesn't
apply to always apps



00:20:59.726 --> 00:21:02.886 A:middle
Oh, that doesn't
apply to always apps

00:21:02.886 --> 00:21:05.156 A:middle
because there's no transaction.

00:21:05.156 --> 00:21:06.286 A:middle
There's no expectation.

00:21:06.616 --> 00:21:08.356 A:middle
If you ask for always
authorization,

00:21:08.356 --> 00:21:11.576 A:middle
then you are basically
asking for carte blanche

00:21:11.636 --> 00:21:13.436 A:middle
and the user doesn't
expect to know

00:21:13.436 --> 00:21:14.566 A:middle
when you are accessing location.

00:21:14.656 --> 00:21:16.636 A:middle
We won't give them
that breadcrumb.

00:21:17.486 --> 00:21:19.666 A:middle
Okay. Background in the case

00:21:19.666 --> 00:21:20.836 A:middle
that I've called
intermittent here.

00:21:20.836 --> 00:21:23.726 A:middle
This is when you're accessing
location from the background,

00:21:23.726 --> 00:21:28.576 A:middle
but it isn't in reaction to a
foreground started or otherwise

00:21:28.576 --> 00:21:30.106 A:middle
like known to the user case.

00:21:30.366 --> 00:21:32.436 A:middle
This is a background
app refresh launch

00:21:32.786 --> 00:21:35.526 A:middle
or a region monitoring launch.

00:21:36.786 --> 00:21:38.536 A:middle
Well, to access the
user's location

00:21:38.536 --> 00:21:40.326 A:middle
in this case you need
always authorization.

00:21:40.706 --> 00:21:41.966 A:middle
That's because they don't know.

00:21:42.326 --> 00:21:44.816 A:middle
That way they can't understand
what is going on intuitively

00:21:44.816 --> 00:21:47.286 A:middle
if they are expected
to consider you in use.

00:21:47.846 --> 00:21:50.746 A:middle
So you can't access the Swift
when in use authorization.

00:21:52.196 --> 00:21:53.066 A:middle
All right.

00:21:53.256 --> 00:21:57.236 A:middle
Brief reappearance of monitoring
API just for the purposes

00:21:57.236 --> 00:21:59.216 A:middle
of this extra row we have.



00:22:00.236 --> 00:22:02.916 A:middle
Little known fact is you can
access monitor API region

00:22:02.916 --> 00:22:04.746 A:middle
monitoring in both cases.

00:22:05.366 --> 00:22:08.356 A:middle
You can access it if you have
always authorization but also

00:22:08.386 --> 00:22:12.766 A:middle
in when in use in using
UI local notifications,

00:22:13.066 --> 00:22:16.546 A:middle
that includes a CL region
as a triggering event

00:22:16.976 --> 00:22:19.676 A:middle
and the user will be notified
whenever you enter or exit

00:22:19.676 --> 00:22:21.366 A:middle
that region and they can
decide whether to pass

00:22:21.366 --> 00:22:22.296 A:middle
that on to you or not.

00:22:22.686 --> 00:22:24.066 A:middle
They are in the loop

00:22:24.096 --> 00:22:27.186 A:middle
and implicitly aware
of what's going on.

00:22:27.616 --> 00:22:30.756 A:middle
How does this story
change for watchOS?

00:22:31.686 --> 00:22:34.526 A:middle
Keep in mind we're talking
about the watchOS component

00:22:34.526 --> 00:22:37.586 A:middle
of your app only, not
the complex of iPhone app

00:22:37.586 --> 00:22:40.966 A:middle
and Watch app, but what can
you do just on Apple Watch?

00:22:42.576 --> 00:22:46.546 A:middle
Can you access location
when the user is poking

00:22:47.756 --> 00:22:50.126 A:middle
at your Watch app?

00:22:50.126 --> 00:22:51.976 A:middle
Yes. But, extensive
background as well.

00:22:52.236 --> 00:22:55.496 A:middle
We only provide the request
location API on watchOS.

00:22:56.236 --> 00:22:59.316 A:middle
You can access single
locations from the user,

00:22:59.606 --> 00:23:01.556 A:middle
but you can't start a
background tracking session



00:22:59.606 --> 00:23:01.556 A:middle
but you can't start a
background tracking session

00:23:01.556 --> 00:23:02.916 A:middle
and you can't do
a tracking session

00:23:02.916 --> 00:23:03.726 A:middle
in the foreground either.

00:23:04.576 --> 00:23:05.276 A:middle
Why is this?

00:23:05.276 --> 00:23:09.026 A:middle
Apple Watch is really
optimized around the quick look.

00:23:09.846 --> 00:23:13.366 A:middle
We don't want the user to sit
there and hold their arm up

00:23:13.366 --> 00:23:15.386 A:middle
and get tired looking at it
for a long period of time

00:23:15.386 --> 00:23:16.936 A:middle
as they walk around the block.

00:23:17.436 --> 00:23:20.636 A:middle
The request location API
is the most appropriate one

00:23:20.636 --> 00:23:21.606 A:middle
to use on Apple Watch.

00:23:22.216 --> 00:23:24.306 A:middle
That doesn't mean you that
can't start a background session

00:23:24.306 --> 00:23:27.086 A:middle
from Apple Watch, that the
user can't record the run using

00:23:27.086 --> 00:23:29.246 A:middle
exclusively interaction
with Apple Watch,

00:23:29.606 --> 00:23:32.116 A:middle
but we will use cooperation with
iPhone to do that, and we'll get

00:23:32.116 --> 00:23:33.866 A:middle
into how in a little bit.

00:23:35.196 --> 00:23:36.566 A:middle
Background intermittent.

00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:40.046 A:middle
There are not many cases where
your watch app will be able

00:23:40.046 --> 00:23:41.206 A:middle
to run in the background.

00:23:41.616 --> 00:23:42.946 A:middle
If you find yourself running

00:23:42.946 --> 00:23:45.356 A:middle
in the background
you can get access

00:23:45.356 --> 00:23:47.696 A:middle
to the user's location only if
you have always authorization.

00:23:48.326 --> 00:23:51.956 A:middle
Not in the most relevant
row in the most table --

00:23:51.956 --> 00:23:54.116 A:middle
in most cases for watchOS.

00:23:56.016 --> 00:23:58.976 A:middle
Monitor API is not available.

00:23:59.016 --> 00:24:02.006 A:middle
You can't -- we can't
launch your app



00:23:59.016 --> 00:24:02.006 A:middle
You can't -- we can't
launch your app

00:24:02.006 --> 00:24:03.786 A:middle
into the background
on Apple Watch.

00:24:04.176 --> 00:24:07.826 A:middle
There's no point in
having these APIs.

00:24:08.136 --> 00:24:12.036 A:middle
Okay. So I have been referring
to this concept of being in use.

00:24:12.246 --> 00:24:13.906 A:middle
Let's drill down on
that a little bit

00:24:13.906 --> 00:24:15.526 A:middle
and get more specific
about what it means.

00:24:16.326 --> 00:24:21.056 A:middle
So your app is considered in
use if it's in the foreground.

00:24:21.686 --> 00:24:23.936 A:middle
This applies to both
iPhone and Apple Watch.

00:24:24.106 --> 00:24:26.176 A:middle
If the user is actively
poking at it.

00:24:26.516 --> 00:24:31.676 A:middle
But since there is such limited
cases, no continuous updates

00:24:31.676 --> 00:24:35.126 A:middle
and there's no background
tracking, that's the only way

00:24:35.126 --> 00:24:36.826 A:middle
on Apple Watch to be
considered in use.

00:24:37.116 --> 00:24:39.836 A:middle
However, on iPhone you can
also be considered to be in use

00:24:39.836 --> 00:24:40.766 A:middle
if you have a Blue Bar,

00:24:41.336 --> 00:24:45.076 A:middle
which means you started a
session and it's ongoing.

00:24:47.066 --> 00:24:49.306 A:middle
So what is the unifying
characteristic here?

00:24:49.306 --> 00:24:52.606 A:middle
How do we extend that
to the Apple Watch case?

00:24:52.986 --> 00:24:55.106 A:middle
Both of these represent
types when you are visible

00:24:55.106 --> 00:24:57.316 A:middle
to the user, yes,
but more specifically

00:24:57.316 --> 00:24:59.636 A:middle
when the user is aware
that you're there, running

00:24:59.636 --> 00:25:02.536 A:middle
and doing something
on their behalf.



00:24:59.636 --> 00:25:02.536 A:middle
and doing something
on their behalf.

00:25:02.616 --> 00:25:04.916 A:middle
So if the user is just
using Apple Watch,

00:25:05.366 --> 00:25:07.576 A:middle
and Apple Watch sends a
message to iPhone in order

00:25:07.576 --> 00:25:10.266 A:middle
to do something on its
behalf, in that case

00:25:10.266 --> 00:25:12.106 A:middle
in use status will
be transferred

00:25:12.106 --> 00:25:15.076 A:middle
to the iPhone app even though
maybe it's in the user's pocket

00:25:15.076 --> 00:25:17.266 A:middle
and they are not using it.

00:25:17.366 --> 00:25:20.286 A:middle
They are using the
aggregate, the whole complex

00:25:20.596 --> 00:25:22.926 A:middle
and authorization is
handled on the complex level.

00:25:23.436 --> 00:25:25.946 A:middle
You need to send the message
using an API we'll get

00:25:25.946 --> 00:25:28.386 A:middle
into in a moment, in
order to accomplish this.

00:25:28.786 --> 00:25:31.516 A:middle
While you are handling
work from Apple Watch

00:25:31.516 --> 00:25:36.266 A:middle
on iPhone you will
be considered in use.

00:25:36.266 --> 00:25:38.316 A:middle
How do you get authorization
in the first place?

00:25:39.196 --> 00:25:40.846 A:middle
Well, you have to ask for it.

00:25:40.946 --> 00:25:43.526 A:middle
Those two APIs that I mentioned
earlier, request with when

00:25:43.526 --> 00:25:45.466 A:middle
in use authorization or
always authorization.

00:25:46.066 --> 00:25:48.816 A:middle
Can you do that from
iPhone, from Apple Watch?

00:25:49.466 --> 00:25:50.146 A:middle
From both, neither?

00:25:50.146 --> 00:25:52.416 A:middle
Neither would be kind of fun.

00:25:52.946 --> 00:25:57.966 A:middle
So, what does this
look like on iPhone?

00:25:57.966 --> 00:25:59.936 A:middle
Well, the user will
launch your app.



00:26:01.336 --> 00:26:04.986 A:middle
And then they'll do
something to indicate

00:26:04.986 --> 00:26:06.436 A:middle
that you need to
access location.

00:26:06.436 --> 00:26:08.476 A:middle
You'll realize you don't
have authorization yet.

00:26:08.986 --> 00:26:11.016 A:middle
You'll call request when
in use authorization.

00:26:11.176 --> 00:26:13.946 A:middle
You'll see that the dialog shows

00:26:13.946 --> 00:26:17.386 A:middle
at the top the request that's
being made to the user.

00:26:17.626 --> 00:26:21.386 A:middle
Then below that we have
your usage description key

00:26:21.386 --> 00:26:22.996 A:middle
which you can set in
your apps info plist

00:26:22.996 --> 00:26:25.076 A:middle
to explain what you're
going to use location for,

00:26:25.076 --> 00:26:28.376 A:middle
and we encourage you to do
a good job of explaining it

00:26:28.376 --> 00:26:32.996 A:middle
so users will understand why
they should grant you this

00:26:33.166 --> 00:26:35.216 A:middle
ability, understand
the tradeoff.

00:26:35.216 --> 00:26:37.686 A:middle
You can see in this
case that it's

00:26:37.686 --> 00:26:38.916 A:middle
for purposes of demonstration.

00:26:38.996 --> 00:26:40.296 A:middle
That sounds pretty appropriate.

00:26:40.296 --> 00:26:42.736 A:middle
Let's allow authorization
in this case.

00:26:43.306 --> 00:26:46.616 A:middle
And you can see immediately
that location updates start.

00:26:47.156 --> 00:26:54.456 A:middle
Okay. So let's send this to the
background after stopping it,

00:26:55.986 --> 00:26:57.296 A:middle
and summarize what we just saw.

00:26:57.296 --> 00:27:01.386 A:middle
When you request location
authorization, from iPhone,



00:26:57.296 --> 00:27:01.386 A:middle
When you request location
authorization, from iPhone,

00:27:01.966 --> 00:27:04.466 A:middle
iPhone shows a prompt
you are all used to.

00:27:05.816 --> 00:27:08.126 A:middle
But also note that Apple
Watch didn't show anything.

00:27:08.196 --> 00:27:09.636 A:middle
It was just along
for the ride there.

00:27:10.076 --> 00:27:12.866 A:middle
That's because when the user is
using their phone they are not

00:27:12.866 --> 00:27:15.666 A:middle
likely to be using their
Watch at the same time.

00:27:15.666 --> 00:27:17.376 A:middle
If they do use it, they
want to see the time

00:27:17.376 --> 00:27:18.776 A:middle
or the app that's there.

00:27:18.776 --> 00:27:22.806 A:middle
So we don't want to block it.

00:27:22.806 --> 00:27:23.966 A:middle
What about the direction then?

00:27:23.966 --> 00:27:27.206 A:middle
Can you ask for location
authorization from Apple Watch?

00:27:27.546 --> 00:27:29.146 A:middle
Yes, you can do this, too.

00:27:29.146 --> 00:27:30.996 A:middle
It has a slightly different
behavior so you'll want

00:27:30.996 --> 00:27:33.486 A:middle
to do this in certain
circumstances and not in others.

00:27:34.496 --> 00:27:35.766 A:middle
Let's see what happens
when we do this.

00:27:36.546 --> 00:27:38.906 A:middle
The user launches your app.

00:27:40.576 --> 00:27:43.316 A:middle
And then they navigate to
the part where you are going

00:27:43.396 --> 00:27:45.956 A:middle
to need location authorization
to fulfill their requirements.

00:27:46.626 --> 00:27:48.306 A:middle
Pretend we didn't just
receive it back there,

00:27:48.426 --> 00:27:51.776 A:middle
it's a fresh start.

00:27:51.776 --> 00:27:53.576 A:middle
You call request when
in use authorization.

00:27:53.666 --> 00:27:58.456 A:middle
The prompt appears on
iPhone and on Apple Watch.

00:27:58.516 --> 00:28:00.406 A:middle
There's an alert that
appears on Apple Watch.



00:27:58.516 --> 00:28:00.406 A:middle
There's an alert that
appears on Apple Watch.

00:28:00.826 --> 00:28:03.656 A:middle
The alert on Apple Watch
says go look at your iPhone,

00:28:03.656 --> 00:28:05.376 A:middle
you have a prompt
to deal with there.

00:28:05.726 --> 00:28:06.816 A:middle
But it has a dismiss button.

00:28:07.386 --> 00:28:09.386 A:middle
That lets the user
dismiss this alert.

00:28:09.386 --> 00:28:10.786 A:middle
It is not modal.

00:28:11.026 --> 00:28:13.756 A:middle
You should expect to
see users interacting

00:28:13.756 --> 00:28:15.936 A:middle
with the app while you have
an outstanding request,

00:28:17.056 --> 00:28:20.206 A:middle
which is unfamiliar to iOS.

00:28:20.206 --> 00:28:24.536 A:middle
It doesn't constitute an
answer to the prompt question.

00:28:24.796 --> 00:28:27.756 A:middle
The user hasn't given up
their ability to option

00:28:27.756 --> 00:28:31.676 A:middle
to make a decision here, they
just said get out of the way.

00:28:31.676 --> 00:28:34.396 A:middle
Still appropriate to demo
purposes, so the user will go

00:28:34.396 --> 00:28:36.316 A:middle
to their phone and authorize us.

00:28:36.736 --> 00:28:40.376 A:middle
It is set to reset quickly.

00:28:41.326 --> 00:28:43.746 A:middle
Looks like we didn't, but if you
look quickly you notice we got

00:28:43.746 --> 00:28:44.156 A:middle
a fix.

00:28:44.396 --> 00:28:49.936 A:middle
You can run it again and again
and see that you got one.

00:28:49.936 --> 00:28:51.456 A:middle
What did we see overall?

00:28:51.616 --> 00:28:52.736 A:middle
What is the story there?

00:28:52.736 --> 00:28:56.096 A:middle
Apple Watch initiated a
request on Apple Watch

00:28:56.406 --> 00:28:59.456 A:middle
and Apple Watch does an alert
so the user knows what is going

00:28:59.456 --> 00:29:03.376 A:middle
on so the user understands
that the workflow needs



00:28:59.456 --> 00:29:03.376 A:middle
on so the user understands
that the workflow needs

00:29:03.696 --> 00:29:06.556 A:middle
to be interrupted to answer the
authorization before whatever

00:29:06.556 --> 00:29:07.876 A:middle
they were trying to
do can go through.

00:29:08.496 --> 00:29:13.196 A:middle
The iPhone shows a prompt as
you're used to and importantly,

00:29:13.336 --> 00:29:15.876 A:middle
the user has to answer
the prompt on iPhone.

00:29:17.746 --> 00:29:18.596 A:middle
All right.

00:29:18.646 --> 00:29:19.866 A:middle
This may seem a little
inconvenient,

00:29:19.866 --> 00:29:22.436 A:middle
so why did we do it?

00:29:22.436 --> 00:29:23.726 A:middle
There's two good
reasons for this.

00:29:24.066 --> 00:29:26.156 A:middle
The first one is, we
do really want you

00:29:26.156 --> 00:29:28.186 A:middle
to give a good explanation
for your use

00:29:28.366 --> 00:29:29.726 A:middle
in that usage description key.

00:29:30.106 --> 00:29:32.266 A:middle
If you did, that would mean
scrolling on Apple Watch.

00:29:32.266 --> 00:29:33.816 A:middle
It's not a great
user experience.

00:29:33.816 --> 00:29:37.056 A:middle
We would rather have the large
screen real estate that we have

00:29:37.056 --> 00:29:38.246 A:middle
on iPhone for this prompt.

00:29:39.126 --> 00:29:41.856 A:middle
We want to set user expectations

00:29:41.926 --> 00:29:43.906 A:middle
of where they can
control authorization.

00:29:44.356 --> 00:29:47.646 A:middle
Right now iPhone is
the root location

00:29:47.646 --> 00:29:49.146 A:middle
for controlling location
authorization

00:29:49.146 --> 00:29:50.866 A:middle
and privacy authorization
in general.

00:29:50.866 --> 00:29:53.896 A:middle
We want to have all the
interactions concentrated

00:29:53.896 --> 00:29:55.796 A:middle
on iPhone so the user
is not surprised.

00:29:55.796 --> 00:30:00.516 A:middle
They can go to settings,
privacy, location services later



00:29:55.796 --> 00:30:00.516 A:middle
They can go to settings,
privacy, location services later

00:30:00.516 --> 00:30:03.966 A:middle
on and change the settings
there if they want to.

00:30:04.846 --> 00:30:05.056 A:middle
All right.

00:30:05.056 --> 00:30:07.456 A:middle
I mentioned earlier that
request location is the API

00:30:07.756 --> 00:30:09.936 A:middle
that we are making
available in watchOS

00:30:09.936 --> 00:30:13.376 A:middle
to access users' interactions
directly from watchOS.

00:30:14.206 --> 00:30:18.826 A:middle
What kind of accuracy
can you expect?

00:30:18.826 --> 00:30:21.306 A:middle
If you are issuing the
request on Apple Watch,

00:30:21.626 --> 00:30:23.926 A:middle
it depends on whether you
have iPhone on hand or not.

00:30:24.296 --> 00:30:28.946 A:middle
If you do, you get everything,
even indoor location fixes

00:30:28.946 --> 00:30:31.396 A:middle
which are accurate down
to only a few meters.

00:30:32.046 --> 00:30:35.606 A:middle
On the other hand, if you don't,
then you can prototype this

00:30:35.606 --> 00:30:38.996 A:middle
and understand the
expectation here as the same

00:30:38.996 --> 00:30:41.926 A:middle
as if you had specified
a requested location,

00:30:41.976 --> 00:30:45.856 A:middle
requested desired accuracy of
KCL location of 100 meters.

00:30:46.356 --> 00:30:50.526 A:middle
This is not location accuracy
best, but bear in mind

00:30:50.566 --> 00:30:52.806 A:middle
that it will usually be
much better than 100 meters.

00:30:53.226 --> 00:30:56.056 A:middle
In fact, in ideal
environments you can even go

00:30:56.056 --> 00:30:56.886 A:middle
for a run with this.

00:30:57.166 --> 00:31:01.086 A:middle
There's no updates
so don't try that.



00:30:57.166 --> 00:31:01.086 A:middle
There's no updates
so don't try that.

00:31:01.356 --> 00:31:03.146 A:middle
The other thing to know
here, it's best effort,

00:31:03.566 --> 00:31:05.546 A:middle
because Apple Watch isn't
connected to the rest

00:31:05.546 --> 00:31:06.866 A:middle
of the world very well.

00:31:06.866 --> 00:31:08.826 A:middle
It could be if it's
in a novel location

00:31:08.826 --> 00:31:10.816 A:middle
where it doesn't have a lot
of experience with the user,

00:31:10.946 --> 00:31:13.476 A:middle
it may be unable to
fix the user's location

00:31:13.476 --> 00:31:14.406 A:middle
in their context.

00:31:14.786 --> 00:31:16.606 A:middle
All right, that's the
best effort disclaimer,

00:31:16.606 --> 00:31:18.836 A:middle
but again it is a
really good effort.

00:31:19.146 --> 00:31:22.646 A:middle
When we have iPhone on hand
we make an aggressive effort

00:31:22.646 --> 00:31:27.286 A:middle
to use its facilities to learn
more about the environment

00:31:27.286 --> 00:31:29.186 A:middle
and cache a good
long distance out.

00:31:29.536 --> 00:31:32.086 A:middle
Probably for a user's run,
unless they are training

00:31:32.146 --> 00:31:34.876 A:middle
for a really long
run, you will be fine.

00:31:35.186 --> 00:31:37.226 A:middle
But just take this into
account when you are trying

00:31:37.226 --> 00:31:39.686 A:middle
to position your
use for your users,

00:31:40.086 --> 00:31:42.886 A:middle
whether they should expect to
bring iPhone with them or not.

00:31:43.356 --> 00:31:46.006 A:middle
If your app is used
around their home or work

00:31:46.006 --> 00:31:48.126 A:middle
or somewhere they
are familiar with,

00:31:48.366 --> 00:31:49.566 A:middle
probably they don't need to.

00:31:49.646 --> 00:31:53.596 A:middle
On the other hand if you are
expecting it to be used on trips

00:31:53.596 --> 00:31:55.166 A:middle
or where the user has
turned the data plan off

00:31:55.166 --> 00:31:58.116 A:middle
so they don't get
charged ridiculously,

00:31:58.116 --> 00:31:59.736 A:middle
you want to encourage them

00:31:59.736 --> 00:32:03.706 A:middle
to bring iPhone along anyway
even if their data is off.



00:31:59.736 --> 00:32:03.706 A:middle
to bring iPhone along anyway
even if their data is off.

00:32:04.186 --> 00:32:08.666 A:middle
But let's suppose we
have iPhone on hand.

00:32:09.136 --> 00:32:12.376 A:middle
Well, if you need
continuous location updates,

00:32:12.976 --> 00:32:17.506 A:middle
common case in the background,
or you need region monitoring

00:32:17.506 --> 00:32:21.176 A:middle
or for that matter if you need
anything else available on iOS

00:32:21.176 --> 00:32:25.006 A:middle
but prohibited on watchOS,
you want to use cooperation

00:32:25.006 --> 00:32:26.086 A:middle
with your iPhone to do that.

00:32:27.076 --> 00:32:27.726 A:middle
How do we do that?

00:32:28.076 --> 00:32:30.676 A:middle
There is a great session,
actually the last session

00:32:30.676 --> 00:32:32.896 A:middle
in this room today before
this one, before lunch.

00:32:32.896 --> 00:32:34.596 A:middle
Unfortunately it's in the past

00:32:34.596 --> 00:32:37.336 A:middle
but you can go see
it on the WWDC app.

00:32:37.336 --> 00:32:39.856 A:middle
If you were here before, great,

00:32:39.856 --> 00:32:41.216 A:middle
this is a little
bit of overview.

00:32:41.446 --> 00:32:42.476 A:middle
This is a portion

00:32:42.476 --> 00:32:44.266 A:middle
of the framework that's
particularly relevant

00:32:44.266 --> 00:32:44.826 A:middle
to location.

00:32:45.526 --> 00:32:47.826 A:middle
First class of interest
is WC session.

00:32:47.826 --> 00:32:50.586 A:middle
This is the class that
represents the connection

00:32:50.586 --> 00:32:52.016 A:middle
between Apple Watch and iPhone.

00:32:52.606 --> 00:32:54.236 A:middle
There's two methods
on it that are

00:32:54.236 --> 00:32:55.906 A:middle
of particular relevance to us.

00:32:55.956 --> 00:32:59.116 A:middle
The first is SendMessage
reply handler error handler

00:32:59.796 --> 00:33:03.446 A:middle
and the second is update
application context.



00:32:59.796 --> 00:33:03.446 A:middle
and the second is update
application context.

00:33:04.106 --> 00:33:06.646 A:middle
SendMessage reply handler
error handler is bidirectional,

00:33:06.646 --> 00:33:07.836 A:middle
you can send it from
either side,

00:33:08.186 --> 00:33:11.506 A:middle
update application context has
to be initiated from iPhone.

00:33:11.506 --> 00:33:14.346 A:middle
Let's take a look at how
these work in practice for us.

00:33:15.476 --> 00:33:19.586 A:middle
We are going to start by
communicating from the Watch app

00:33:19.876 --> 00:33:23.036 A:middle
to our iPhone app using
SendMessage reply handler

00:33:23.256 --> 00:33:25.276 A:middle
error handler.

00:33:26.016 --> 00:33:28.326 A:middle
The user navigates to
the part of the app

00:33:28.326 --> 00:33:30.806 A:middle
where we need help
from the other side.

00:33:31.196 --> 00:33:33.066 A:middle
And they ask us to start.

00:33:33.736 --> 00:33:37.036 A:middle
We send that message across and
you can see the app comes up.

00:33:37.436 --> 00:33:39.786 A:middle
And the Blue Bar came down
too in the video, too,

00:33:39.786 --> 00:33:41.116 A:middle
to indicate that it was able

00:33:41.116 --> 00:33:43.466 A:middle
to get continuous
background location session.

00:33:44.076 --> 00:33:48.806 A:middle
It can start sending
that information back.

00:33:49.706 --> 00:33:51.566 A:middle
And you can see the
updates coming

00:33:51.566 --> 00:33:53.956 A:middle
in on the watch display
if it's not too tiny.

00:33:53.956 --> 00:33:58.016 A:middle
We are going to stop
and put everything away.

00:33:58.136 --> 00:34:02.276 A:middle
And okay? Then we can
review what happened there.



00:33:58.136 --> 00:34:02.276 A:middle
And okay? Then we can
review what happened there.

00:34:02.276 --> 00:34:06.266 A:middle
So crucially, if you send
a message to the iPhone app

00:34:06.266 --> 00:34:08.896 A:middle
and it's not running, it
can be launched if necessary

00:34:09.065 --> 00:34:12.706 A:middle
by SendMessage from
Apple Watch to iPhone.

00:34:12.706 --> 00:34:13.676 A:middle
So you don't have to worry

00:34:13.676 --> 00:34:15.686 A:middle
about having the user
go start the app.

00:34:15.686 --> 00:34:16.976 A:middle
They can leave the
phone in their pocket

00:34:16.976 --> 00:34:20.176 A:middle
and everything can
take care of itself.

00:34:20.176 --> 00:34:22.525 A:middle
Of note, in use status
transferred.

00:34:22.606 --> 00:34:25.626 A:middle
I mentioned this before,
you just saw it in action

00:34:25.976 --> 00:34:28.366 A:middle
because the user is using the
Watch, they are using your app,

00:34:28.856 --> 00:34:29.946 A:middle
that means it is entitled

00:34:29.946 --> 00:34:32.926 A:middle
to start a background location
tracking continuous session

00:34:32.996 --> 00:34:34.726 A:middle
on iPhone.

00:34:34.726 --> 00:34:37.166 A:middle
That also means take
special account

00:34:37.166 --> 00:34:40.366 A:middle
of this allows background
location updates flag property.

00:34:40.366 --> 00:34:42.666 A:middle
You need to set this
to yes if you intend

00:34:42.666 --> 00:34:44.585 A:middle
to start a continuous
background location session

00:34:44.985 --> 00:34:47.626 A:middle
and set it to no if you don't.

00:34:47.626 --> 00:34:51.255 A:middle
When the user pulls their phone
out and happens to be looking

00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:53.926 A:middle
at it while they are using their
watch they won't see mysterious

00:34:54.206 --> 00:34:57.906 A:middle
Blue Bars dipping in and out.

00:34:58.176 --> 00:34:59.346 A:middle
What about the other direction?

00:34:59.636 --> 00:35:01.946 A:middle
So iPhone to Apple Watch.



00:34:59.636 --> 00:35:01.946 A:middle
So iPhone to Apple Watch.

00:35:03.696 --> 00:35:06.226 A:middle
Well, we can use SendMessage
reply handler error handler

00:35:06.326 --> 00:35:07.616 A:middle
because it's a bidirectional
API.

00:35:08.916 --> 00:35:13.646 A:middle
When we do that, you see we
have a bit of a problem here.

00:35:13.966 --> 00:35:15.546 A:middle
Our messages aren't
getting through.

00:35:15.546 --> 00:35:17.966 A:middle
In fact, what happens
in this case,

00:35:17.966 --> 00:35:21.596 A:middle
because the Watch app is not
running, we are just going

00:35:21.596 --> 00:35:23.876 A:middle
to get the error handler called

00:35:23.876 --> 00:35:26.096 A:middle
on our delegate each
time we do this.

00:35:26.096 --> 00:35:29.496 A:middle
SendMessage reply handler error
handler is launching in the case

00:35:29.566 --> 00:35:34.146 A:middle
of app to phone, and
it is not launching

00:35:35.076 --> 00:35:38.806 A:middle
in the case of phone to watch.

00:35:39.396 --> 00:35:45.026 A:middle
Maybe we should look into the
other API I mentioned earlier,

00:35:45.196 --> 00:35:46.486 A:middle
update application context.

00:35:47.226 --> 00:35:48.636 A:middle
This is phone to watch.

00:35:48.636 --> 00:35:49.926 A:middle
We can use this API.

00:35:50.546 --> 00:35:52.966 A:middle
And when we do, something
different happens.

00:35:53.706 --> 00:35:58.376 A:middle
So our Apple Watch app is still
not running, but the messages

00:35:58.376 --> 00:36:00.926 A:middle
that we send hang out.



00:35:58.376 --> 00:36:00.926 A:middle
that we send hang out.

00:36:00.926 --> 00:36:02.496 A:middle
In particular, the
last one hangs out.

00:36:02.766 --> 00:36:04.686 A:middle
You don't want to use
this method of facility

00:36:04.686 --> 00:36:07.946 A:middle
to send delta updates
but you do want

00:36:07.946 --> 00:36:11.016 A:middle
to send state updates,
full context updates.

00:36:11.016 --> 00:36:14.166 A:middle
When you do, the system
will hold on to it for you

00:36:14.166 --> 00:36:18.486 A:middle
until the user does update,
does launch your app.

00:36:21.246 --> 00:36:24.086 A:middle
Okay, at that time your
app launches and it gets

00:36:24.086 --> 00:36:25.466 A:middle
that update that's
waiting for it.

00:36:25.776 --> 00:36:27.056 A:middle
You can see if you
look carefully

00:36:27.056 --> 00:36:29.436 A:middle
that it already knew
it was started.

00:36:30.116 --> 00:36:32.596 A:middle
You can send continuing
periodic updates

00:36:32.596 --> 00:36:35.906 A:middle
across from your phone app
later on to update the UI.

00:36:36.706 --> 00:36:38.946 A:middle
That initial state
was already there.

00:36:38.946 --> 00:36:41.376 A:middle
That update application
context is appropriate to use

00:36:41.376 --> 00:36:43.856 A:middle
for subsequent communications
as well.

00:36:44.416 --> 00:36:45.446 A:middle
All right.

00:36:46.826 --> 00:36:51.446 A:middle
Then one thing to bring up
with regard to this whole path

00:36:51.446 --> 00:36:54.886 A:middle
from iPhone to Apple Watch is
also take a look at this API

00:36:54.886 --> 00:36:56.286 A:middle
that we introduced
in Core Location

00:36:56.286 --> 00:36:59.536 A:middle
in iOS 6 called allowed
deferred location updates

00:36:59.586 --> 00:37:01.076 A:middle
until traveled time out.



00:36:59.586 --> 00:37:01.076 A:middle
until traveled time out.

00:37:01.706 --> 00:37:06.636 A:middle
This API will, sort of a
natural complement to the system

00:37:06.636 --> 00:37:09.716 A:middle
because when the user is
not looking at Apple Watch,

00:37:10.076 --> 00:37:11.586 A:middle
you don't need to keep
it up to the second.

00:37:11.876 --> 00:37:13.906 A:middle
You need to keep it
somewhat up to date.

00:37:13.966 --> 00:37:16.516 A:middle
The best way to do that
is batch up the updates,

00:37:16.626 --> 00:37:18.166 A:middle
send them over every so often,

00:37:18.406 --> 00:37:21.576 A:middle
so you don't keep the user's
Bluetooth radio running all the

00:37:21.576 --> 00:37:23.346 A:middle
time and we can save some power.

00:37:23.826 --> 00:37:28.386 A:middle
On the iOS side, on the
phone you can use this API

00:37:29.006 --> 00:37:32.186 A:middle
on Core Location in
order to indicate

00:37:32.186 --> 00:37:35.426 A:middle
that right now you are running
in such a latency tolerant mode

00:37:35.846 --> 00:37:36.996 A:middle
and you don't need to be woken

00:37:36.996 --> 00:37:38.646 A:middle
up until the user has
gone a certain distance

00:37:38.686 --> 00:37:40.256 A:middle
or until a certain
amount of time has passed.

00:37:40.626 --> 00:37:44.536 A:middle
Maybe they went a mile,
this is their pace.

00:37:44.536 --> 00:37:47.306 A:middle
If you hit the timeout
based on distance,

00:37:47.306 --> 00:37:49.036 A:middle
it has been five minutes,

00:37:49.036 --> 00:37:52.536 A:middle
or you want to send an
update to your Apple Watch.

00:37:53.116 --> 00:37:55.856 A:middle
Okay, so that's it.

00:37:56.196 --> 00:37:58.846 A:middle
So we've got allows
background location updates.

00:37:58.846 --> 00:37:59.846 A:middle
This is a new property.



00:38:00.226 --> 00:38:02.086 A:middle
You have to take action on
this but it will free you

00:38:02.086 --> 00:38:05.786 A:middle
from a couple of hassles with
close coupling and high stakes.

00:38:06.566 --> 00:38:08.786 A:middle
After that we've got
request location.

00:38:08.786 --> 00:38:12.216 A:middle
This is a new method on C
location manager that allows you

00:38:12.216 --> 00:38:13.556 A:middle
to cut out some

00:38:13.556 --> 00:38:16.836 A:middle
of the boilerplate you probably
all have and get one location

00:38:16.836 --> 00:38:17.596 A:middle
when that's all you need.

00:38:18.776 --> 00:38:22.096 A:middle
The theme for using both of
these devices is cooperation.

00:38:22.096 --> 00:38:24.226 A:middle
And the great news, I'm happy

00:38:24.226 --> 00:38:28.086 A:middle
to say we've got a
sample called potluck

00:38:28.086 --> 00:38:29.936 A:middle
which demonstrates everything
we talked about today.

00:38:30.026 --> 00:38:32.656 A:middle
In fact, that's the app that
we demoed for these videos,

00:38:32.656 --> 00:38:36.576 A:middle
and you can install it
yourself and run it.

00:38:36.576 --> 00:38:38.746 A:middle
Hopefully if the app you're
working on isn't working,

00:38:39.056 --> 00:38:43.646 A:middle
potluck will and you
can converge and figure

00:38:43.916 --> 00:38:45.246 A:middle
out where the error might be.

00:38:47.336 --> 00:38:49.916 A:middle
Here is a bunch of information,

00:38:49.916 --> 00:38:51.786 A:middle
I'm sure you can all
scribble down quickly.

00:38:51.786 --> 00:38:53.736 A:middle
The top part is probably
the most important.

00:38:53.736 --> 00:38:55.376 A:middle
Check out potluck.

00:38:55.566 --> 00:38:57.606 A:middle
This link takes you
to the sample code.

00:38:57.606 --> 00:39:00.706 A:middle
Scroll down until you get to the
P section and there's potluck.



00:38:57.606 --> 00:39:00.706 A:middle
Scroll down until you get to the
P section and there's potluck.

00:39:01.346 --> 00:39:04.186 A:middle
These are the sessions I thought
might be especially relevant

00:39:04.186 --> 00:39:04.536 A:middle
for you.

00:39:04.536 --> 00:39:08.526 A:middle
They are all in the past, but
they're all on tape as well.

00:39:08.606 --> 00:39:09.966 A:middle
You can go check them out later.

00:39:10.246 --> 00:39:15.116 A:middle
And especially Introducing
WatchKIt 2.0 at the top

00:39:15.116 --> 00:39:18.736 A:middle
and Introducing Watch
Connectivity, that's the API

00:39:18.736 --> 00:39:23.086 A:middle
that I was just talking
about at the bottom.

00:39:24.186 --> 00:39:25.536 A:middle
That's it.

00:39:25.746 --> 00:39:27.436 A:middle
I hope to see you all there.

00:39:27.436 --> 00:39:29.456 A:middle
I can't wait to see
what you can create

00:39:29.526 --> 00:39:33.346 A:middle
with the iOS 9 watchOS
2 and Core Location.

00:39:33.376 --> 00:39:33.976 A:middle
Keep up the good work.

00:39:34.516 --> 00:39:39.500 A:middle
[Applause and cheers]
