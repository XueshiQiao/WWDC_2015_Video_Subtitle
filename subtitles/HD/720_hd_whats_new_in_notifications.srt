00:00:31.796 --> 00:00:32.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; MICHELE CAMPEOTTO:
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:32.946 --> 00:00:33.326 A:middle
Thank you.

00:00:34.286 --> 00:00:36.226 A:middle
You guys have been
doing some great work

00:00:36.226 --> 00:00:37.866 A:middle
with notifications in the US.

00:00:38.196 --> 00:00:40.666 A:middle
So today, we are going over a
little bit the entire system,

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.706 A:middle
how it works and we will see
some new features we created

00:00:43.706 --> 00:00:43.966 A:middle
for you.

00:00:45.186 --> 00:00:47.136 A:middle
Notifications are
a two-part system.

00:00:47.136 --> 00:00:49.806 A:middle
We have iOS notifications
and APNS.

00:00:50.896 --> 00:00:53.796 A:middle
My name is Michele, and I work
in the iOS Notifications team.

00:00:53.796 --> 00:00:55.696 A:middle
We will start with
iOS notifications.

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:59.076 A:middle
We will talk about
silent notifications

00:00:59.546 --> 00:01:02.146 A:middle
and user notifications
and what is the difference



00:00:59.546 --> 00:01:02.146 A:middle
and user notifications
and what is the difference

00:01:02.146 --> 00:01:03.176 A:middle
between these two.

00:01:03.386 --> 00:01:08.256 A:middle
We will see notification
actions and a new feature

00:01:08.256 --> 00:01:10.886 A:middle
that I hope you guys
are really enjoying.

00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:14.156 A:middle
In the second half
of the presentation,

00:01:14.456 --> 00:01:16.486 A:middle
my colleague Gokul will talk

00:01:16.486 --> 00:01:18.866 A:middle
about some important
new features

00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:22.826 A:middle
in Apple Push Notification
Service, that I think are going

00:01:22.826 --> 00:01:28.786 A:middle
to make your work much easier
and save you a lot of time.

00:01:28.986 --> 00:01:31.786 A:middle
So let's start from
silent notifications.

00:01:32.886 --> 00:01:34.786 A:middle
Silent notifications are silent.

00:01:35.116 --> 00:01:37.126 A:middle
They don't show UI to the user.

00:01:37.516 --> 00:01:39.876 A:middle
They don't buzz the phone.

00:01:40.276 --> 00:01:42.346 A:middle
So you don't use them
to notify the user.

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:43.896 A:middle
You use them to notify
your own app.

00:01:45.056 --> 00:01:46.326 A:middle
They are remote notifications.

00:01:46.326 --> 00:01:48.066 A:middle
So they come from the Internet.

00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:50.246 A:middle
Here's your server,
and your app.

00:01:50.826 --> 00:01:53.796 A:middle
Your server sends a
notification to your app,

00:01:54.846 --> 00:01:57.996 A:middle
and if you send the content
available flag to one,

00:01:58.276 --> 00:02:00.806 A:middle
your app knows that there's
going to be new content



00:01:58.276 --> 00:02:00.806 A:middle
your app knows that there's
going to be new content

00:02:00.806 --> 00:02:04.306 A:middle
to be downloaded, so it
will start and download it.

00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:09.436 A:middle
Silent notifications
are enabled by default.

00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:13.166 A:middle
The user does not need
to approve your --

00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:16.556 A:middle
does not give permission
to your app to use them,

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:18.816 A:middle
and you can just
start using them

00:02:18.816 --> 00:02:21.126 A:middle
without asking the
user for permission.

00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:26.586 A:middle
But silent notifications are
the mechanism behind background

00:02:26.586 --> 00:02:27.326 A:middle
app refresh.

00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:30.206 A:middle
At any point you know
that the user can go

00:02:30.206 --> 00:02:31.806 A:middle
in settings and disable them.

00:02:32.246 --> 00:02:35.566 A:middle
So you can't depend on them
always being available.

00:02:35.566 --> 00:02:38.166 A:middle
You don't know if the
user the turn them off,

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:40.526 A:middle
and you are not getting
a notification anymore.

00:02:42.536 --> 00:02:47.346 A:middle
This also means that silent
notifications are delivered

00:02:47.346 --> 00:02:48.306 A:middle
with the best effort.

00:02:48.696 --> 00:02:51.646 A:middle
That means that when
the notification arrives

00:02:51.976 --> 00:02:55.746 A:middle
on the user's device, the system
is going to make some choices.

00:02:55.746 --> 00:02:58.946 A:middle
It's going to use different
signals from the device

00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:02.186 A:middle
and from the user behavior,
like power or the time of day



00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:02.186 A:middle
and from the user behavior,
like power or the time of day

00:03:02.726 --> 00:03:04.976 A:middle
to decide when it is a good time

00:03:05.266 --> 00:03:07.496 A:middle
to deliver the notification
and launch your app.

00:03:08.486 --> 00:03:10.856 A:middle
It may try to save
battery or it may try

00:03:10.856 --> 00:03:15.066 A:middle
to match the user behavior
and make the content available

00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:19.246 A:middle
when the user is more
likely to use it.

00:03:19.506 --> 00:03:21.636 A:middle
Next part is user notifications.

00:03:22.686 --> 00:03:25.826 A:middle
As the name says, the main
difference is that you use these

00:03:25.936 --> 00:03:29.656 A:middle
to notify the user, when you
want to tell the user something,

00:03:29.896 --> 00:03:32.836 A:middle
when you want to notify them
of something that happened

00:03:32.836 --> 00:03:35.886 A:middle
on your server, or from
some other user of your app.

00:03:36.456 --> 00:03:39.966 A:middle
They appear in the user
page that you know, banners,

00:03:39.966 --> 00:03:41.626 A:middle
lockscreen, notification center.

00:03:42.106 --> 00:03:46.496 A:middle
Since these notifications
are for the user

00:03:46.496 --> 00:03:48.586 A:middle
and they can interrupt
what the user is doing,

00:03:48.856 --> 00:03:49.996 A:middle
they can buzz their phone.

00:03:50.516 --> 00:03:52.266 A:middle
We do require permission.

00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:55.776 A:middle
You want to make sure that they
want to receive the notification

00:03:55.776 --> 00:03:58.526 A:middle
and they are aware that they
are going to receive it.

00:03:59.276 --> 00:04:02.666 A:middle
That also means that they can
also be disabled at any point



00:03:59.276 --> 00:04:02.666 A:middle
That also means that they can
also be disabled at any point

00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:05.196 A:middle
in time, and the user
can change a setting.

00:04:05.296 --> 00:04:09.706 A:middle
So even if you set up your
notifications to be banners

00:04:09.746 --> 00:04:12.316 A:middle
and badges, maybe the
user disables part of it,

00:04:12.616 --> 00:04:18.986 A:middle
and they just receive the
badge and not the banner.

00:04:19.036 --> 00:04:21.516 A:middle
There are two different
types of user notifications.

00:04:22.836 --> 00:04:25.106 A:middle
The first one is
remote notifications

00:04:25.106 --> 00:04:27.166 A:middle
and the second one is
local notifications.

00:04:28.246 --> 00:04:30.746 A:middle
Let's see remote
notifications first.

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:34.566 A:middle
They are remote, so they
come from the Internet again,

00:04:34.946 --> 00:04:36.026 A:middle
and that's your server again.

00:04:36.936 --> 00:04:41.116 A:middle
That sends a notification
to the user's device.

00:04:41.276 --> 00:04:46.546 A:middle
Now, you see that at this
point in time, your app is not

00:04:46.546 --> 00:04:48.976 A:middle
in the picture yet because
your app is not running.

00:04:50.466 --> 00:04:52.446 A:middle
Your app is launched only

00:04:52.446 --> 00:04:54.516 A:middle
when the user taps
on the notification.

00:04:55.216 --> 00:04:58.366 A:middle
When the user taps on the
notification, we launch the app,

00:04:58.866 --> 00:05:01.636 A:middle
and you have the opportunity
to handle the notification



00:04:58.866 --> 00:05:01.636 A:middle
and you have the opportunity
to handle the notification

00:05:01.636 --> 00:05:05.666 A:middle
that you sent at that point.

00:05:07.016 --> 00:05:11.196 A:middle
Now, you can in a user
remote notification,

00:05:11.196 --> 00:05:15.956 A:middle
you can set the same content
available flag that you set

00:05:15.956 --> 00:05:18.816 A:middle
in silent notifications,
and that allows your app

00:05:18.886 --> 00:05:23.106 A:middle
to have some time to
download the content

00:05:23.106 --> 00:05:26.986 A:middle
or update the content that it
wants to be displayed so that

00:05:26.986 --> 00:05:28.826 A:middle
when the user taps
on the notification,

00:05:29.676 --> 00:05:31.666 A:middle
your content is available.

00:05:32.036 --> 00:05:33.896 A:middle
And the user sees what it does.

00:05:34.996 --> 00:05:39.226 A:middle
This is a way to have a silent
notification inside a user

00:05:39.226 --> 00:05:43.836 A:middle
notifications like a summary.

00:05:43.986 --> 00:05:46.806 A:middle
Second, is local notifications.

00:05:47.396 --> 00:05:50.656 A:middle
Local notifications are
scheduled by your own app,

00:05:51.396 --> 00:05:52.836 A:middle
directly on the user's device.

00:05:53.556 --> 00:05:54.306 A:middle
There's no server.

00:05:54.306 --> 00:05:55.006 A:middle
There's no Internet.

00:05:55.616 --> 00:05:59.626 A:middle
As before, your app
schedules the notification.



00:06:00.156 --> 00:06:05.366 A:middle
The system displays it to the
user, and when the user taps

00:06:05.366 --> 00:06:08.596 A:middle
on the notification, your
app receives a callback

00:06:08.596 --> 00:06:11.916 A:middle
in the app delegate
and at that point,

00:06:12.176 --> 00:06:14.926 A:middle
you can handle the
notifications and you know

00:06:14.926 --> 00:06:17.176 A:middle
that the user tapped
on it and wants

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:18.596 A:middle
to act on the notification.

00:06:19.136 --> 00:06:23.296 A:middle
I said that you can
schedule from your app.

00:06:23.936 --> 00:06:24.606 A:middle
How do you do that?

00:06:25.316 --> 00:06:27.196 A:middle
You can schedule
the notification

00:06:27.196 --> 00:06:28.206 A:middle
in two different ways.

00:06:29.026 --> 00:06:30.476 A:middle
You can schedule them by time,

00:06:31.186 --> 00:06:34.886 A:middle
so you can have the notification
happen with a delay,

00:06:35.756 --> 00:06:37.806 A:middle
after a certain amount of time,

00:06:38.076 --> 00:06:42.026 A:middle
or you can have the notification
happen at a specific time

00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:44.416 A:middle
in the future, a
specific time and date.

00:06:44.926 --> 00:06:48.706 A:middle
Another way that you can
schedule notifications

00:06:49.196 --> 00:06:50.856 A:middle
is geofences.

00:06:50.936 --> 00:06:55.516 A:middle
You can set notifications to
appear when the user arrives

00:06:55.866 --> 00:06:58.726 A:middle
or leaves a certain
location that you decide.

00:06:58.726 --> 00:07:01.376 A:middle
So this is how notifications
work



00:06:58.726 --> 00:07:01.376 A:middle
So this is how notifications
work

00:07:01.376 --> 00:07:02.746 A:middle
from the user's point of view.

00:07:02.786 --> 00:07:03.786 A:middle
This was how notifications work.

00:07:03.786 --> 00:07:06.506 A:middle
In iOS 8, we introduced
notification actions.

00:07:07.656 --> 00:07:09.796 A:middle
Notification actions allow you

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:12.076 A:middle
to make your notifications
more interactive,

00:07:12.686 --> 00:07:15.466 A:middle
so that a user can
interact with your app

00:07:15.536 --> 00:07:18.856 A:middle
without actually launching it
and make them more efficient

00:07:18.916 --> 00:07:22.056 A:middle
because when they receive the
notification, they can act

00:07:22.056 --> 00:07:23.936 A:middle
on it right there
without launching the app

00:07:23.936 --> 00:07:28.376 A:middle
and interrupting
what they were doing.

00:07:28.946 --> 00:07:31.726 A:middle
Actions are grouped
in categories.

00:07:32.736 --> 00:07:35.736 A:middle
You can use different categories
to group different types

00:07:36.086 --> 00:07:37.986 A:middle
of notifications
that you are sending

00:07:38.396 --> 00:07:40.996 A:middle
so that you can have
different actions

00:07:41.296 --> 00:07:43.056 A:middle
in different types
of notifications.

00:07:43.516 --> 00:07:49.066 A:middle
Say you have a photo app that
users use to share photos,

00:07:49.646 --> 00:07:52.186 A:middle
you can have a different
set of actions

00:07:52.186 --> 00:08:01.256 A:middle
when someone posts a photo or
when someone posts a comment.



00:07:52.186 --> 00:08:01.256 A:middle
when someone posts a photo or
when someone posts a comment.

00:08:01.376 --> 00:08:04.556 A:middle
Now, all of this
that we are talking

00:08:04.556 --> 00:08:08.146 A:middle
until now is also
forwarded to the Apple Watch.

00:08:08.976 --> 00:08:11.626 A:middle
You don't need to do
anything, and everything works

00:08:11.896 --> 00:08:13.896 A:middle
on the watch, if the
user is wearing it

00:08:13.986 --> 00:08:17.866 A:middle
and it's paired with the device.

00:08:17.986 --> 00:08:22.086 A:middle
You get the basic and
default behavior just

00:08:22.256 --> 00:08:24.576 A:middle
by having your notification
set up correctly.

00:08:24.826 --> 00:08:28.336 A:middle
If you want to customize
the look of the notification

00:08:28.336 --> 00:08:30.436 A:middle
or the behavior of
the notifications,

00:08:31.096 --> 00:08:35.025 A:middle
I suggest you take a look at
the WatchKit presentations

00:08:35.025 --> 00:08:37.956 A:middle
that we had earlier in the
week and they have a lot

00:08:37.956 --> 00:08:39.025 A:middle
of useful information.

00:08:41.876 --> 00:08:46.386 A:middle
Now, if you don't
always communicate

00:08:46.386 --> 00:08:49.396 A:middle
with your friends using only
emojis as I've been dooing

00:08:49.486 --> 00:08:54.786 A:middle
in the presentation until now,
we introduced a new feature

00:08:54.786 --> 00:09:00.156 A:middle
in iOS 8 for notifications and
that feature is text reply.



00:08:54.786 --> 00:09:00.156 A:middle
in iOS 8 for notifications and
that feature is text reply.

00:09:00.756 --> 00:09:05.426 A:middle
When you receive a text message,
you can pull down the banner

00:09:05.986 --> 00:09:09.606 A:middle
and respond to the text
message right there.

00:09:09.876 --> 00:09:13.276 A:middle
So we have heard some
feedback, and it looks

00:09:13.276 --> 00:09:17.406 A:middle
like you also enjoy conversating

00:09:17.406 --> 00:09:19.666 A:middle
with your friends using
words instead of emojis.

00:09:19.666 --> 00:09:25.226 A:middle
In iOS 9, we are introducing
user notification text input

00:09:25.956 --> 00:09:28.206 A:middle
so you can use the same UI

00:09:28.336 --> 00:09:31.746 A:middle
and the same interactive
notifications in your own app.

00:09:32.296 --> 00:09:33.306 A:middle
How does that look?

00:09:34.716 --> 00:09:36.506 A:middle
It looks like this.

00:09:37.916 --> 00:09:39.436 A:middle
You send a notification
from your app.

00:09:40.956 --> 00:09:43.606 A:middle
The user can pull down and
type the text response.

00:09:44.246 --> 00:09:46.466 A:middle
Words instead of emojis.

00:09:47.066 --> 00:09:48.996 A:middle
This is how we look.

00:09:49.646 --> 00:09:55.926 A:middle
Let's see how to do this and
how they work, how they behave.

00:09:56.526 --> 00:10:01.476 A:middle
Text input actions are
just a new type of action.



00:09:56.526 --> 00:10:01.476 A:middle
Text input actions are
just a new type of action.

00:10:01.636 --> 00:10:05.036 A:middle
They -- you create and
you use them the same way

00:10:05.036 --> 00:10:07.996 A:middle
that you use the actions that
they were already used to.

00:10:08.556 --> 00:10:10.556 A:middle
They appear in the same spots

00:10:11.126 --> 00:10:16.146 A:middle
that all the other actions
appear, and as you noticed

00:10:16.146 --> 00:10:20.666 A:middle
from these slides, they work
together with other actions.

00:10:20.766 --> 00:10:25.006 A:middle
You can have more than
one action and one or more

00:10:25.006 --> 00:10:27.286 A:middle
of them can be text
input actions.

00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:31.646 A:middle
This is something that
not even messages can do.

00:10:31.896 --> 00:10:34.706 A:middle
How do you create them?

00:10:34.956 --> 00:10:38.856 A:middle
So we said that they are
just actions, like the one

00:10:38.856 --> 00:10:40.376 A:middle
that we used until iOS 8.

00:10:41.506 --> 00:10:43.776 A:middle
So you create them exactly

00:10:43.776 --> 00:10:46.256 A:middle
as you created the
notification actions.

00:10:46.966 --> 00:10:51.606 A:middle
The only difference is that
you set the behavior to be

00:10:51.606 --> 00:10:54.626 A:middle
at text input behavior, so that

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:57.386 A:middle
when the device receives
the notification

00:10:57.386 --> 00:11:00.706 A:middle
and there's a new action
with the text input behavior,



00:10:57.386 --> 00:11:00.706 A:middle
and there's a new action
with the text input behavior,

00:11:00.706 --> 00:11:01.936 A:middle
we can display the text field.

00:11:03.336 --> 00:11:05.016 A:middle
So here we created our action.

00:11:05.636 --> 00:11:08.986 A:middle
Then we register it by
creating our category.

00:11:09.686 --> 00:11:11.376 A:middle
In this example,
it's a simple one.

00:11:11.736 --> 00:11:15.016 A:middle
We only have a reply action,
but we can add more actions here

00:11:15.316 --> 00:11:16.966 A:middle
and they will appear
in the banner

00:11:16.966 --> 00:11:18.596 A:middle
or in the alerts
in the lock screen.

00:11:19.796 --> 00:11:21.546 A:middle
Then we create our settings

00:11:22.156 --> 00:11:24.116 A:middle
and we register them
with the application.

00:11:24.566 --> 00:11:29.096 A:middle
This is the point where the
user is going to be prompted

00:11:29.216 --> 00:11:32.506 A:middle
for permission to use
the user notifications.

00:11:33.466 --> 00:11:36.956 A:middle
So if notifications are
an option in your app,

00:11:37.246 --> 00:11:41.376 A:middle
they are not required, maybe
you don't need to register them

00:11:41.376 --> 00:11:42.326 A:middle
when the app launches.

00:11:42.326 --> 00:11:44.676 A:middle
You can register them
when the user says, yes,

00:11:44.916 --> 00:11:46.456 A:middle
I do want to receive
a notification.

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:47.356 A:middle
There is a button somewhere.

00:11:47.886 --> 00:11:54.126 A:middle
How do you receive these
text input notifications?

00:11:55.496 --> 00:11:59.036 A:middle
There's a new delegate in your
app delegate, a new method



00:12:00.026 --> 00:12:03.346 A:middle
and it's very similar
to the delegate we used

00:12:03.346 --> 00:12:04.946 A:middle
for the old type of actions.

00:12:05.326 --> 00:12:08.436 A:middle
The only difference is that
now you have a new parameter

00:12:08.746 --> 00:12:11.176 A:middle
that tells you the
response from the user.

00:12:12.086 --> 00:12:15.436 A:middle
This is from the delegate
for the remote notifications

00:12:16.066 --> 00:12:18.096 A:middle
and this is the one for
local notifications.

00:12:18.476 --> 00:12:23.596 A:middle
There's a tiny difference, but
they are two different methods.

00:12:26.016 --> 00:12:30.156 A:middle
How do you handle the data
that you receive from the user?

00:12:31.486 --> 00:12:32.286 A:middle
This is the delegate.

00:12:34.006 --> 00:12:38.366 A:middle
We have the identifier that
was set in the category

00:12:38.366 --> 00:12:39.866 A:middle
when we registered
the notifications.

00:12:41.466 --> 00:12:45.746 A:middle
We have the response info,
and that contains a dictionary

00:12:46.156 --> 00:12:49.236 A:middle
with information sent back
from the notification.

00:12:49.766 --> 00:12:52.336 A:middle
In this case, since it's
a text input action,

00:12:52.336 --> 00:12:55.136 A:middle
it will contain the text
that the user typed.

00:12:55.136 --> 00:13:00.916 A:middle
This is a check that the
identifier is actually the one



00:12:55.136 --> 00:13:00.916 A:middle
This is a check that the
identifier is actually the one

00:13:01.566 --> 00:13:07.466 A:middle
for the comment reply action
that I created and then I go

00:13:07.526 --> 00:13:10.776 A:middle
and extract the text
from the dictionary.

00:13:11.466 --> 00:13:13.186 A:middle
There's some conversion
to be done,

00:13:13.466 --> 00:13:17.006 A:middle
but when I have the string, I
can do whatever I need to do.

00:13:17.006 --> 00:13:22.086 A:middle
Like, in this example, I
can append it to my chat app

00:13:22.086 --> 00:13:22.826 A:middle
in the view controller.

00:13:23.656 --> 00:13:27.786 A:middle
All of this is also
supported by the Apple Watch.

00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:29.826 A:middle
It just works.

00:13:30.316 --> 00:13:31.566 A:middle
You create a notification.

00:13:32.266 --> 00:13:33.346 A:middle
You create the actions.

00:13:33.436 --> 00:13:37.546 A:middle
You have the text reply and the
user gets the standard Apple

00:13:37.546 --> 00:13:40.846 A:middle
Watch Quickboard to reply
to the notification.

00:13:41.726 --> 00:13:44.376 A:middle
And same as I said before,

00:13:45.016 --> 00:13:49.366 A:middle
if you want to customize the
way it looks or other behaviors,

00:13:49.366 --> 00:13:53.056 A:middle
you can for example customize
the list of responses

00:13:53.096 --> 00:13:54.956 A:middle
that the user can tap on here.

00:13:55.576 --> 00:13:58.306 A:middle
Again, check the
WatchKit sessions

00:13:58.306 --> 00:14:03.516 A:middle
that we had earlier in the week.



00:13:58.306 --> 00:14:03.516 A:middle
that we had earlier in the week.

00:14:03.716 --> 00:14:05.696 A:middle
Now, I have one more thing.

00:14:06.816 --> 00:14:08.726 A:middle
Unfortunately it's not
a new iPod classic.

00:14:08.906 --> 00:14:10.356 A:middle
It's not super exciting.

00:14:10.966 --> 00:14:12.806 A:middle
It's iOS 8 compatibility.

00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:17.426 A:middle
It's a small thing, but you
need to pay attention because,

00:14:18.696 --> 00:14:23.046 A:middle
say you have an app
in iOS 8 with actions,

00:14:23.766 --> 00:14:28.476 A:middle
and you already had a reply
action because you have a chat

00:14:28.476 --> 00:14:31.736 A:middle
up and when the user receives
the notification, you want --

00:14:33.076 --> 00:14:36.416 A:middle
if they tap on the reply
button, they can go directly

00:14:36.416 --> 00:14:38.436 A:middle
to the conversation
that they were having.

00:14:38.436 --> 00:14:40.886 A:middle
So you open your app in
the right conversation

00:14:40.886 --> 00:14:42.106 A:middle
and they can start
typing right away.

00:14:43.546 --> 00:14:47.986 A:middle
In this case, you would have
used a foreground action

00:14:48.306 --> 00:14:51.916 A:middle
because that is when
we launch the app,

00:14:52.106 --> 00:14:57.286 A:middle
when the user taps
on the action.

00:14:57.466 --> 00:15:01.866 A:middle
Now, when you do this
in iOS 9, and you want



00:14:57.466 --> 00:15:01.866 A:middle
Now, when you do this
in iOS 9, and you want

00:15:01.866 --> 00:15:07.346 A:middle
to use a text input action, you
would use a background action,

00:15:07.346 --> 00:15:09.516 A:middle
because you don't want
the app to be launched.

00:15:09.516 --> 00:15:13.666 A:middle
You want the text input right
there and the banner to go away

00:15:13.666 --> 00:15:15.296 A:middle
when the user typed
and sends a response.

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:22.076 A:middle
You see that you have a problem,
and you need your action

00:15:22.076 --> 00:15:23.926 A:middle
to be registered in
two different ways,

00:15:23.926 --> 00:15:28.446 A:middle
depending on if your app is
running on iOS 8 or iOS 9.

00:15:29.476 --> 00:15:33.536 A:middle
So when you are registering
your actions at the beginning,

00:15:33.536 --> 00:15:36.646 A:middle
the piece of code that
we saw, you need to check

00:15:37.786 --> 00:15:39.526 A:middle
on which version of
iOS you are running.

00:15:39.846 --> 00:15:43.356 A:middle
You can check if the API
is available and decide

00:15:43.356 --> 00:15:46.486 A:middle
to do the two things
in different ways.

00:15:48.036 --> 00:15:50.866 A:middle
So this was text input action.

00:15:52.766 --> 00:15:57.046 A:middle
We saw iOS notifications,
how they work in the system.

00:15:58.576 --> 00:16:01.366 A:middle
We saw silent notifications
that you can use



00:15:58.576 --> 00:16:01.366 A:middle
We saw silent notifications
that you can use

00:16:01.366 --> 00:16:05.246 A:middle
to have your app update the
content and be already available

00:16:05.246 --> 00:16:06.466 A:middle
for when the user uses it.

00:16:07.386 --> 00:16:10.316 A:middle
We saw user notifications,
and actions.

00:16:10.916 --> 00:16:15.416 A:middle
We saw the new text
input feature

00:16:15.416 --> 00:16:19.366 A:middle
that I hope you guys
are really going to use.

00:16:20.826 --> 00:16:23.356 A:middle
And how all of this
forwards to the Apple Watch

00:16:23.356 --> 00:16:25.756 A:middle
and how it behaves
on the Apple Watch.

00:16:26.286 --> 00:16:31.726 A:middle
And now, I'm going to leave
the stage to my colleague Gokul

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:35.176 A:middle
who will tell you about
some important news

00:16:35.176 --> 00:16:37.016 A:middle
about Apple Push
Notification Service.

00:16:37.326 --> 00:16:37.966 A:middle
Thank you.

00:16:38.516 --> 00:16:46.136 A:middle
[Applause]

00:16:46.636 --> 00:16:47.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; GOKUL THIRUMALAI:
Good afternoon.

00:16:47.656 --> 00:16:48.476 A:middle
My name is Gokul.

00:16:49.166 --> 00:16:52.386 A:middle
I work on the Apple Push
Notification Service or APNS.

00:16:53.856 --> 00:16:55.946 A:middle
And I'm really excited
to be here to tell you

00:16:55.946 --> 00:16:57.846 A:middle
about all the new things we
we're doing here this year

00:16:57.846 --> 00:16:58.476 A:middle
with APNS.

00:16:58.476 --> 00:16:59.476 A:middle
So let's get started.



00:17:00.496 --> 00:17:05.665 A:middle
We will start with a review of
how APNS works, for those of you

00:17:05.665 --> 00:17:09.976 A:middle
that are new to iOS remote
notifications, or APNS.

00:17:11.036 --> 00:17:13.866 A:middle
And then we'll talk about
the new provider API

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:16.675 A:middle
that we are really thrilled
to be announcing this year.

00:17:17.856 --> 00:17:19.976 A:middle
The flow of remote notifications

00:17:19.976 --> 00:17:23.925 A:middle
through APNS has these
four familiar components.

00:17:23.925 --> 00:17:27.296 A:middle
The bottom right is your
client app that runs

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:29.596 A:middle
on the operating system
on the bottom left,

00:17:30.316 --> 00:17:33.566 A:middle
and the top left is APNS and
the top right is your provider

00:17:33.566 --> 00:17:36.156 A:middle
that is responsible for
sending remote notifications.

00:17:37.386 --> 00:17:40.006 A:middle
So the flow starts
with you registering

00:17:40.006 --> 00:17:41.506 A:middle
to receive notifications

00:17:42.156 --> 00:17:43.926 A:middle
with the operating system,
from the client app.

00:17:45.236 --> 00:17:48.556 A:middle
When you do that, the operating
system gets a device token

00:17:48.556 --> 00:17:51.446 A:middle
that is unique to your
client app from APNS,

00:17:52.646 --> 00:17:54.246 A:middle
and that is returned
back to your client app,

00:17:54.246 --> 00:17:59.076 A:middle
and then you register
that with your provider

00:17:59.226 --> 00:18:02.106 A:middle
which is your server,
that is responsible



00:17:59.226 --> 00:18:02.106 A:middle
which is your server,
that is responsible

00:18:02.416 --> 00:18:04.056 A:middle
for sending remote
notifications.

00:18:04.566 --> 00:18:08.316 A:middle
Now your provider is
ultimately responsible

00:18:08.316 --> 00:18:10.956 A:middle
for sending remote notifications
and the first step to doing

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:15.466 A:middle
that is to register your topic
in the Apple developer portal,

00:18:16.046 --> 00:18:18.636 A:middle
and get a certificate
that you can use

00:18:18.856 --> 00:18:22.446 A:middle
to securely talk to APNS.

00:18:22.446 --> 00:18:23.636 A:middle
Once you have the certificate,

00:18:24.226 --> 00:18:29.346 A:middle
you can establish a client
SSL connection to APNS

00:18:29.646 --> 00:18:32.946 A:middle
and send your remote
notifications using the APNS

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:33.476 A:middle
provider API.

00:18:33.476 --> 00:18:39.216 A:middle
Now, the APNS provided
API is an extremely fast,

00:18:39.426 --> 00:18:44.386 A:middle
very high performance server
API with very low overhead,

00:18:44.386 --> 00:18:47.506 A:middle
and it allows you to
send a large number

00:18:47.506 --> 00:18:49.726 A:middle
of push notifications just
using a single connection.

00:18:50.906 --> 00:18:52.196 A:middle
For even higher throughput,

00:18:52.236 --> 00:18:54.556 A:middle
you can create many
connections to APNS if you want.

00:18:55.216 --> 00:18:59.536 A:middle
After you are done sending
notifications you can leave the

00:18:59.536 --> 00:19:02.356 A:middle
connection up and
you can reuse it.



00:18:59.536 --> 00:19:02.356 A:middle
connection up and
you can reuse it.

00:19:02.356 --> 00:19:04.566 A:middle
APNS will not tear the
connection down immediately.

00:19:05.616 --> 00:19:06.806 A:middle
That way you don't pay the cost

00:19:06.806 --> 00:19:08.456 A:middle
of establishing a
new connection later.

00:19:09.046 --> 00:19:13.326 A:middle
If there's any errors
encompassing your connection,

00:19:13.606 --> 00:19:15.976 A:middle
APNS will return an error
code and close the connection.

00:19:16.546 --> 00:19:20.036 A:middle
That's a review of the
current API that we have.

00:19:21.356 --> 00:19:26.586 A:middle
What happens if you uninstall
your app from the device,

00:19:26.676 --> 00:19:29.176 A:middle
how do you find out
about these device tokens

00:19:29.176 --> 00:19:30.176 A:middle
that are no longer active?

00:19:31.156 --> 00:19:32.706 A:middle
That's where feedback
service comes in.

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:38.086 A:middle
Feedback service is the way
you can discover apps --

00:19:38.086 --> 00:19:40.846 A:middle
device tokens that are no longer
active for your application

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:43.956 A:middle
so you don't waste resources
trying to send notifications

00:19:43.956 --> 00:19:45.546 A:middle
that are ultimately
going to be thrown away.

00:19:46.096 --> 00:19:51.006 A:middle
It starts when you send a device
-- when you send a notification

00:19:51.006 --> 00:19:54.316 A:middle
to a device token
and APNS discovers

00:19:54.626 --> 00:19:58.696 A:middle
that the device token is no
longer active, it will store it

00:19:58.696 --> 00:20:00.166 A:middle
in the APNS feedback service.



00:19:58.696 --> 00:20:00.166 A:middle
in the APNS feedback service.

00:20:02.116 --> 00:20:05.416 A:middle
Providers can then periodically
pull the APNS feedback service

00:20:05.416 --> 00:20:07.176 A:middle
and discover the device
tokens that are invalid

00:20:07.486 --> 00:20:08.636 A:middle
and clean up the database.

00:20:09.126 --> 00:20:14.026 A:middle
That's a quick summary
of feedback service.

00:20:14.356 --> 00:20:16.736 A:middle
Let's look at what's ahead.

00:20:17.816 --> 00:20:20.306 A:middle
Coming next year are
large device tokens.

00:20:21.346 --> 00:20:23.286 A:middle
Device tokens today
are 32 bytes.

00:20:24.386 --> 00:20:28.856 A:middle
And next year, in 2016, they
may be growing up to 100 bytes.

00:20:29.366 --> 00:20:33.056 A:middle
So if you make any assumptions
about the size of device tokens

00:20:33.056 --> 00:20:38.706 A:middle
in your code, or in your
server APIs, now is a good time

00:20:38.826 --> 00:20:40.146 A:middle
to revisit those assumptions.

00:20:40.606 --> 00:20:44.706 A:middle
Large device tokens
coming in 2016.

00:20:45.306 --> 00:20:48.226 A:middle
So that's a review
of the provider API

00:20:48.226 --> 00:20:50.086 A:middle
and what's ahead next year.

00:20:50.536 --> 00:20:51.956 A:middle
Let's talk about what
we are doing this year.

00:20:52.496 --> 00:20:56.186 A:middle
So we have a brand
new provider API

00:20:57.126 --> 00:20:58.606 A:middle
that we think you
will really love.

00:20:59.146 --> 00:21:05.466 A:middle
This new provider API is built
on four primary features.



00:20:59.146 --> 00:21:05.466 A:middle
This new provider API is built
on four primary features.

00:21:05.976 --> 00:21:11.866 A:middle
And we think that it will help
you send notifications more

00:21:11.866 --> 00:21:16.296 A:middle
reliably without
compromising speed or efficiency

00:21:17.206 --> 00:21:19.496 A:middle
in your apps, in your providers.

00:21:19.976 --> 00:21:27.486 A:middle
The first feature of the
new provider API is HTTP/2.

00:21:28.056 --> 00:21:30.086 A:middle
The new provider API --

00:21:31.516 --> 00:21:35.496 A:middle
[Applause]

00:21:35.996 --> 00:21:38.346 A:middle
The new provider
API is built on top

00:21:38.346 --> 00:21:41.976 A:middle
of the brand new HTTP/2
industry standard.

00:21:42.526 --> 00:21:48.896 A:middle
HTTP/2 is latest evolution
of the popular HTTP protocol,

00:21:48.896 --> 00:21:54.426 A:middle
and I'm really happy to build a
new provider API on top of that.

00:21:54.426 --> 00:21:57.276 A:middle
Why did we choose HTTP/2
for our new provider API,

00:21:57.276 --> 00:21:59.886 A:middle
and what benefits do you get?



00:22:00.676 --> 00:22:03.296 A:middle
There are three primary
things that we think

00:22:03.296 --> 00:22:05.466 A:middle
that HTTP/2 really
brings to the table.

00:22:07.156 --> 00:22:09.946 A:middle
The first thing is that
it's a request response,

00:22:10.106 --> 00:22:11.016 A:middle
just like HTTP.

00:22:12.006 --> 00:22:14.986 A:middle
So every notification that
you send from your provider

00:22:14.986 --> 00:22:18.666 A:middle
to APNS will get a response
back from the server.

00:22:19.226 --> 00:22:23.206 A:middle
And this builds on top of
familiar HTTP semantics

00:22:23.206 --> 00:22:27.626 A:middle
that you are already used
to, like URIs, headers,

00:22:27.926 --> 00:22:30.346 A:middle
response codes, things
you can act on.

00:22:30.896 --> 00:22:36.426 A:middle
And this we think will help you
build more reliable providers

00:22:37.056 --> 00:22:38.616 A:middle
to send push notifications.

00:22:39.636 --> 00:22:40.756 A:middle
So request response.

00:22:41.646 --> 00:22:45.026 A:middle
Second, HTTP/2 is a
multiplex protocol.

00:22:45.886 --> 00:22:48.356 A:middle
This is much like the
current provider protocol

00:22:48.356 --> 00:22:49.146 A:middle
that we have today.

00:22:50.446 --> 00:22:52.156 A:middle
So we're not compromising
on speed.

00:22:53.296 --> 00:22:55.856 A:middle
Multiplexing in HTTP/2 means

00:22:55.856 --> 00:22:59.606 A:middle
that you can send multiple
requests simultaneously

00:22:59.606 --> 00:23:01.046 A:middle
on a single connection
to the server.



00:22:59.606 --> 00:23:01.046 A:middle
on a single connection
to the server.

00:23:02.076 --> 00:23:04.966 A:middle
So you are not wasting resources
setting up new connections

00:23:04.966 --> 00:23:08.546 A:middle
for every request or
anything like that.

00:23:08.746 --> 00:23:12.626 A:middle
Each multiplexed request
response is called a stream.

00:23:13.146 --> 00:23:15.456 A:middle
We will look at that
a little bit later.

00:23:16.026 --> 00:23:18.556 A:middle
So request response
and multiplexed.

00:23:19.426 --> 00:23:22.236 A:middle
The third thing that HTTP/2 is
great for is that it's binary,

00:23:23.036 --> 00:23:24.426 A:middle
much like our current protocol.

00:23:25.776 --> 00:23:28.086 A:middle
We are not compromising
on efficiency

00:23:28.756 --> 00:23:30.906 A:middle
by adopting the new
HTTP/2 provider API.

00:23:32.546 --> 00:23:35.096 A:middle
With binary, HTTP
frames that are sent

00:23:35.096 --> 00:23:38.906 A:middle
over the wire are not text
like HTTP, but binary,

00:23:39.566 --> 00:23:42.296 A:middle
and you also get to
benefit from things

00:23:42.296 --> 00:23:44.946 A:middle
like header compression
with HPACK.

00:23:45.716 --> 00:23:49.476 A:middle
These three things make
it a really ideal choice

00:23:49.476 --> 00:23:50.476 A:middle
for the new provider API.

00:23:51.776 --> 00:23:54.726 A:middle
In addition to these, there
are also some benefits

00:23:54.926 --> 00:23:57.226 A:middle
like being an industry standard.

00:23:57.516 --> 00:23:59.326 A:middle
You can benefit from libraries

00:23:59.326 --> 00:24:02.416 A:middle
and tooling that's already
out there for HTTP/2.



00:23:59.326 --> 00:24:02.416 A:middle
and tooling that's already
out there for HTTP/2.

00:24:03.556 --> 00:24:08.656 A:middle
Overall, we think this is
going to be really exciting.

00:24:09.256 --> 00:24:14.426 A:middle
Now, the flow of HTTP/2
provider API looks exactly

00:24:14.426 --> 00:24:17.666 A:middle
like the flow you have
today, except the connection,

00:24:18.086 --> 00:24:21.536 A:middle
the protocol between the
provider and APNS is HTTP/2.

00:24:21.836 --> 00:24:24.416 A:middle
So you don't need to modify your
client app, the way it talks

00:24:24.416 --> 00:24:27.216 A:middle
to the operating system or the
way it talks to your provider

00:24:27.426 --> 00:24:28.856 A:middle
in order to benefit
from this new API.

00:24:28.856 --> 00:24:34.046 A:middle
You can adopt the API, and you
will instantly benefit from it.

00:24:35.396 --> 00:24:37.686 A:middle
Let's drill into what
that process looks like.

00:24:37.846 --> 00:24:40.916 A:middle
The first step here is
establishing a connection,

00:24:41.006 --> 00:24:43.446 A:middle
from your provider, to APNS.

00:24:43.926 --> 00:24:46.386 A:middle
When you establish a connection,

00:24:46.606 --> 00:24:49.386 A:middle
it uses the same
client certificates

00:24:49.526 --> 00:24:53.736 A:middle
that you already have today
with the current provider API.

00:24:54.416 --> 00:24:55.966 A:middle
So using that certificate,

00:24:55.966 --> 00:24:58.976 A:middle
you can establish a client
authenticated SSL connection

00:24:59.506 --> 00:25:03.576 A:middle
to APNS, and as soon as the
connection is established,



00:24:59.506 --> 00:25:03.576 A:middle
to APNS, and as soon as the
connection is established,

00:25:03.966 --> 00:25:07.536 A:middle
HTTP/2 starts by
exchanging settings frames.

00:25:10.256 --> 00:25:13.916 A:middle
Settings frames contain
details like number

00:25:13.916 --> 00:25:16.246 A:middle
of concurrent requests you
can issue over that connection

00:25:16.776 --> 00:25:19.346 A:middle
or the header table
parameter sizes and so forth.

00:25:20.626 --> 00:25:22.576 A:middle
As soon as the settings
frames are exchanged,

00:25:22.576 --> 00:25:24.796 A:middle
as soon as you send the setting
frames from the provider,

00:25:25.076 --> 00:25:28.246 A:middle
you can start sending
your notification data,

00:25:28.246 --> 00:25:29.546 A:middle
your notification requests.

00:25:30.066 --> 00:25:34.036 A:middle
Let's take a look at what a
notification request would

00:25:34.506 --> 00:25:35.976 A:middle
look like.

00:25:36.226 --> 00:25:38.336 A:middle
Each notification
request that you make

00:25:38.336 --> 00:25:40.346 A:middle
to APNS is a post request.

00:25:41.686 --> 00:25:44.416 A:middle
This post request
is made to a URI

00:25:44.656 --> 00:25:48.316 A:middle
that includes the device
token and has a body,

00:25:48.316 --> 00:25:49.886 A:middle
the JSON body that's exactly

00:25:49.886 --> 00:25:52.256 A:middle
like the current provider
API that you use today.

00:25:53.166 --> 00:25:57.106 A:middle
And this JSON payload is
delivered intact to the device.

00:25:57.606 --> 00:26:03.546 A:middle
Now, to take an advantage
of HTTP/2 multiplexing.



00:25:57.606 --> 00:26:03.546 A:middle
Now, to take an advantage
of HTTP/2 multiplexing.

00:26:04.356 --> 00:26:07.076 A:middle
If you have multiple requests,
multiple notifications

00:26:07.076 --> 00:26:09.926 A:middle
that you want to send,
then you can send them all

00:26:09.926 --> 00:26:10.686 A:middle
in the same connection.

00:26:11.246 --> 00:26:14.446 A:middle
That's what a request
looks like.

00:26:14.826 --> 00:26:16.476 A:middle
What about a response
to that request?

00:26:18.796 --> 00:26:22.176 A:middle
The response to a request
in this new provider API,

00:26:22.686 --> 00:26:24.816 A:middle
if everything works
great, no problems.

00:26:25.216 --> 00:26:26.926 A:middle
You get a 200 status okay.

00:26:27.846 --> 00:26:28.936 A:middle
Everything is successful,

00:26:28.936 --> 00:26:31.456 A:middle
continue to send
notifications as you already do.

00:26:32.046 --> 00:26:34.536 A:middle
What if there's a failure?

00:26:35.056 --> 00:26:40.846 A:middle
What if you had a bad device
token, and APNS failed

00:26:40.846 --> 00:26:43.396 A:middle
to process your message?

00:26:43.556 --> 00:26:45.076 A:middle
You get a 400 bad request.

00:26:45.956 --> 00:26:47.826 A:middle
The body -- the response body

00:26:47.946 --> 00:26:50.946 A:middle
for that request
includes the JSON payload

00:26:50.946 --> 00:26:53.776 A:middle
with a reason why
your request failed.

00:26:54.736 --> 00:26:58.806 A:middle
It will say "bad device token"
and the connection will stay up.

00:26:58.806 --> 00:27:00.586 A:middle
You can continue to
send more requests



00:26:58.806 --> 00:27:00.586 A:middle
You can continue to
send more requests

00:27:00.586 --> 00:27:05.526 A:middle
over this HTTP connection to the
server, and everything is well.

00:27:06.306 --> 00:27:08.696 A:middle
So that's what a request
response looks like.

00:27:08.696 --> 00:27:12.476 A:middle
Now, I think it will be useful
to go through an example

00:27:12.476 --> 00:27:15.196 A:middle
of what a request response using
this new provider API would look

00:27:15.196 --> 00:27:17.336 A:middle
like on the wire.

00:27:17.596 --> 00:27:22.136 A:middle
If you have not seen an
HTTP/2 request response,

00:27:22.136 --> 00:27:24.436 A:middle
this might look like
a lot of text,

00:27:24.436 --> 00:27:25.926 A:middle
but I will walk you through it.

00:27:26.486 --> 00:27:27.716 A:middle
So here is an example.

00:27:28.246 --> 00:27:31.916 A:middle
Notice that this is
a request in HTTP/2

00:27:31.916 --> 00:27:34.966 A:middle
and there are two
frames in the stream.

00:27:35.756 --> 00:27:37.206 A:middle
The first frame is
a header frame,

00:27:37.206 --> 00:27:39.086 A:middle
and the second frame
is the data frame.

00:27:39.636 --> 00:27:45.536 A:middle
The header frame contains things
like the post as the method

00:27:45.916 --> 00:27:49.936 A:middle
or the URI containing the device
token for your application

00:27:49.936 --> 00:27:52.376 A:middle
that you are sending
this notification to.

00:27:54.236 --> 00:27:57.256 A:middle
The header frame also
contains optional parameters

00:27:57.486 --> 00:28:01.576 A:middle
like expiration, ID, priority,
things of that nature.



00:27:57.486 --> 00:28:01.576 A:middle
like expiration, ID, priority,
things of that nature.

00:28:05.916 --> 00:28:08.856 A:middle
In the data frame is
the actual JSON payload

00:28:09.126 --> 00:28:11.526 A:middle
that you want delivered
to the device.

00:28:12.196 --> 00:28:14.036 A:middle
In this example, this
is a simple alert

00:28:14.036 --> 00:28:16.316 A:middle
and it says hello, HTTP/2.

00:28:16.626 --> 00:28:18.886 A:middle
That's what a request
locks like.

00:28:19.196 --> 00:28:21.226 A:middle
Let's look at what the
response for this might be.

00:28:22.336 --> 00:28:24.356 A:middle
The response in this case
is everything was great.

00:28:24.356 --> 00:28:25.856 A:middle
You get a 200 okay.

00:28:26.136 --> 00:28:26.906 A:middle
Nothing more to do.

00:28:26.906 --> 00:28:27.456 A:middle
Short and sweet.

00:28:28.016 --> 00:28:32.956 A:middle
If there's a failure, say,
the device token was bad,

00:28:33.066 --> 00:28:36.686 A:middle
here's what the response
might look like.

00:28:37.356 --> 00:28:40.006 A:middle
Again, two frames, a header
frame and a data frame.

00:28:41.306 --> 00:28:43.306 A:middle
Notice that the status
now says 400.

00:28:44.406 --> 00:28:48.356 A:middle
And the body is a JSON
payload that has the reason

00:28:48.356 --> 00:28:50.026 A:middle
for why your request failed.

00:28:50.306 --> 00:28:51.926 A:middle
So in this case it was
a bad device token.

00:28:52.536 --> 00:28:56.256 A:middle
So you can act on that
response, and continue

00:28:56.256 --> 00:28:57.966 A:middle
to process other notifications.

00:28:58.366 --> 00:29:01.366 A:middle
So that's a quick look



00:28:58.366 --> 00:29:01.366 A:middle
So that's a quick look

00:29:01.366 --> 00:29:06.606 A:middle
at the new HTTP/2 request
response provider API.

00:29:06.606 --> 00:29:10.296 A:middle
That's the first feature
of this new provider API.

00:29:12.636 --> 00:29:15.586 A:middle
The next feature is feedback.

00:29:16.046 --> 00:29:16.806 A:middle
What about feedback?

00:29:17.406 --> 00:29:19.436 A:middle
With the new provider API,

00:29:19.436 --> 00:29:21.996 A:middle
we are introducing
instant feedback.

00:29:23.346 --> 00:29:26.046 A:middle
With instant feedback,
you don't need to talk

00:29:26.046 --> 00:29:29.626 A:middle
to a separate feedback service
to get the device tokens

00:29:29.856 --> 00:29:31.906 A:middle
that are no longer active
for your application.

00:29:33.356 --> 00:29:35.846 A:middle
You get -- you can
instantly learn

00:29:35.846 --> 00:29:37.626 A:middle
about them in the response.

00:29:38.836 --> 00:29:41.186 A:middle
So going back to the
flow of feedback service.

00:29:42.896 --> 00:29:46.946 A:middle
Instead of polling
periodically from APNS feedback

00:29:46.946 --> 00:29:52.456 A:middle
from your provider, you can
now instead get feedback

00:29:52.456 --> 00:29:53.236 A:middle
in the response.

00:29:53.906 --> 00:29:57.626 A:middle
And the HTTP status
code in the response,

00:29:58.286 --> 00:30:03.196 A:middle
in the case of feedback, will be
a status 410, 410 meaning gone,



00:29:58.286 --> 00:30:03.196 A:middle
in the case of feedback, will be
a status 410, 410 meaning gone,

00:30:03.406 --> 00:30:05.696 A:middle
that the device token
is no longer active

00:30:06.086 --> 00:30:06.826 A:middle
for your application.

00:30:07.436 --> 00:30:10.306 A:middle
In addition to this status code

00:30:10.536 --> 00:30:12.396 A:middle
that the device token
is no longer active,

00:30:13.576 --> 00:30:18.746 A:middle
you also get the time stamp for
the last time that APNS learned

00:30:19.036 --> 00:30:20.726 A:middle
that the device token
was no longer active

00:30:20.726 --> 00:30:21.466 A:middle
for your application.

00:30:22.626 --> 00:30:24.386 A:middle
Let's take a look at an example.

00:30:24.386 --> 00:30:26.286 A:middle
So you sent a notification.

00:30:26.656 --> 00:30:27.556 A:middle
You sent a request.

00:30:27.936 --> 00:30:31.306 A:middle
And it turned out the device
token was no longer active

00:30:31.306 --> 00:30:33.826 A:middle
for your application,
so you can clean it

00:30:33.826 --> 00:30:35.566 A:middle
up so you don't send
notifications to it anymore.

00:30:36.776 --> 00:30:38.546 A:middle
The response might look
something hike this.

00:30:38.876 --> 00:30:43.366 A:middle
Notice there's the status
410 and there's a time stamp.

00:30:43.476 --> 00:30:46.136 A:middle
This is the time stamp
that APNS last confirmed

00:30:46.436 --> 00:30:49.076 A:middle
that the device token
is no longer valid

00:30:49.076 --> 00:30:49.826 A:middle
for your application.

00:30:50.376 --> 00:30:56.416 A:middle
So HTTP/2 provider API
and instant feedback.

00:30:57.116 --> 00:31:01.816 A:middle
The third new feature of this
new provider API is simplified



00:30:57.116 --> 00:31:01.816 A:middle
The third new feature of this
new provider API is simplified

00:31:01.816 --> 00:31:02.656 A:middle
certificate handling.

00:31:03.256 --> 00:31:06.806 A:middle
We know you make reach
applications with a lot

00:31:06.806 --> 00:31:11.226 A:middle
of features and through
development and production,

00:31:11.546 --> 00:31:14.056 A:middle
we understand that you have to
create a lot of certificates.

00:31:14.576 --> 00:31:17.816 A:middle
We simplify certificate
handling --

00:31:19.776 --> 00:31:23.146 A:middle
before simplify certificate
handling, here's an example

00:31:23.146 --> 00:31:24.746 A:middle
of certificates would
you have to deal with.

00:31:25.416 --> 00:31:27.466 A:middle
You would have a
certificate for,

00:31:27.466 --> 00:31:31.086 A:middle
let's say your application
topic, perhaps one for VOIP,

00:31:31.756 --> 00:31:38.026 A:middle
one for watch complications,
and if you were working

00:31:38.026 --> 00:31:40.086 A:middle
with development and
production environments,

00:31:40.506 --> 00:31:45.456 A:middle
you might have sets of
certificates for each of these.

00:31:45.676 --> 00:31:47.276 A:middle
With simplified certificate
handling,

00:31:47.916 --> 00:31:51.416 A:middle
you now can use a single
certificate for all

00:31:51.416 --> 00:31:52.866 A:middle
of your pushes for
your application.

00:31:53.516 --> 00:32:00.596 A:middle
[Applause]



00:31:53.516 --> 00:32:00.596 A:middle
[Applause]

00:32:01.096 --> 00:32:01.616 A:middle
It's exciting.

00:32:02.436 --> 00:32:04.436 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:08.716 A:middle
So HTTP/2 provider
API, instant feedback,

00:32:09.736 --> 00:32:11.226 A:middle
and simplified certificate
handling.

00:32:11.696 --> 00:32:14.796 A:middle
Three new features of
the new provider API.

00:32:15.486 --> 00:32:21.846 A:middle
Now, last year, we increased the
push payload size from 256 bytes

00:32:22.226 --> 00:32:24.196 A:middle
to 2 kilobites to
a lot of applause.

00:32:26.476 --> 00:32:29.966 A:middle
This year, we are doubling
this to 4 kilobytes.

00:32:30.516 --> 00:32:35.296 A:middle
[Applause]

00:32:35.796 --> 00:32:40.726 A:middle
The 4 kilobyte limit will apply
to all versions of iOS and OS X.

00:32:41.276 --> 00:32:46.366 A:middle
So it's not exclusive to
iOS 9 or OS X, El Capitan.

00:32:46.936 --> 00:32:51.596 A:middle
It will be part of
the new provider API.

00:32:52.446 --> 00:32:54.806 A:middle
So that's the new provider API.

00:32:55.646 --> 00:33:00.096 A:middle
To review, there's a new request
response, HTTP/2 interface.



00:32:55.646 --> 00:33:00.096 A:middle
To review, there's a new request
response, HTTP/2 interface.

00:33:01.916 --> 00:33:03.986 A:middle
There's instant feedback
where you can learn

00:33:03.986 --> 00:33:07.596 A:middle
about device tokens that
are no longer active.

00:33:07.746 --> 00:33:10.966 A:middle
Simplified certificate
handling will get you a single

00:33:10.966 --> 00:33:15.136 A:middle
certificate for all
pushes to your topics.

00:33:16.186 --> 00:33:17.996 A:middle
And a new 4 kilobyte payload.

00:33:20.256 --> 00:33:24.536 A:middle
The new provider API
will be available

00:33:24.536 --> 00:33:27.036 A:middle
in APNS development
environments this summer.

00:33:28.096 --> 00:33:32.446 A:middle
And we will be rolling it out
to production later this year.

00:33:32.646 --> 00:33:35.406 A:middle
Once again, the new
provider API can be used

00:33:35.586 --> 00:33:41.106 A:middle
to send notifications to all
versions of iOS and OS X.

00:33:41.106 --> 00:33:43.296 A:middle
You don't need to
create any special logic

00:33:43.296 --> 00:33:44.396 A:middle
for version compatibility.

00:33:45.046 --> 00:33:48.296 A:middle
So that's the new provider API.

00:33:49.506 --> 00:33:52.206 A:middle
For more information
on Michele's section

00:33:52.306 --> 00:33:56.036 A:middle
on iOS notification as
well as APNS, please refer

00:33:56.036 --> 00:33:58.386 A:middle
to the APNS developer
documentation.

00:33:59.356 --> 00:34:02.016 A:middle
The new provider API will be
documented later this year.



00:33:59.356 --> 00:34:02.016 A:middle
The new provider API will be
documented later this year.

00:34:02.556 --> 00:34:07.196 A:middle
You can also access technical
support and developer forums,

00:34:07.756 --> 00:34:10.106 A:middle
and please direct
general inquiries to Paul,

00:34:10.106 --> 00:34:11.356 A:middle
our core list evangelist.

00:34:13.436 --> 00:34:15.896 A:middle
There are related sessions
you may be interested in,

00:34:16.545 --> 00:34:19.356 A:middle
specifically ones about
ClockKit, Watch connectivity,

00:34:19.466 --> 00:34:23.576 A:middle
and things that Michel
demoed and the networking

00:34:23.576 --> 00:34:26.926 A:middle
with NSURL session has
more details on HTTP/2.

00:34:27.585 --> 00:34:28.505 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:34:28.726 --> 00:34:29.426 A:middle
Have a great evening.

00:34:30.016 --> 00:34:32.000 A:middle
[Applause]
