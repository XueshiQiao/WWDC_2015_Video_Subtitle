00:00:22.016 --> 00:00:23.256 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:23.636 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JOSH SHAFFER: All right.

00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:24.506 A:middle
Good morning.

00:00:25.036 --> 00:00:27.746 A:middle
Thank you for coming out this
morning to learn what's new

00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:29.706 A:middle
in WatchKit and watchOS 2.

00:00:30.476 --> 00:00:32.686 A:middle
We've got a lot of great stuff
to talk about this morning.

00:00:33.436 --> 00:00:36.496 A:middle
Of course WatchKit will be
the biggest part of the topic,

00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:37.846 A:middle
What's New in WatchKit,
after all.

00:00:38.806 --> 00:00:43.246 A:middle
WatchKit is now one part of
the overall watchOS platform.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:45.476 A:middle
There's a whole bunch
of other frameworks.

00:00:45.886 --> 00:00:47.186 A:middle
Many of which you're
already familiar

00:00:47.186 --> 00:00:50.386 A:middle
with in building your iOS apps,
but there's a few new ones

00:00:50.386 --> 00:00:53.546 A:middle
that are specific to
watchOS that provide features

00:00:53.546 --> 00:00:54.996 A:middle
that are unique to Apple Watch.

00:00:55.606 --> 00:00:58.306 A:middle
We're going to talk through all
of those new things and some

00:00:58.306 --> 00:00:59.306 A:middle
of the ones you're
already familiar

00:00:59.306 --> 00:01:02.326 A:middle
with to cover what's new in
those specifically in watchOS.



00:00:59.306 --> 00:01:02.326 A:middle
with to cover what's new in
those specifically in watchOS.

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:07.746 A:middle
That's going to be watchOS 2.

00:01:08.976 --> 00:01:11.266 A:middle
First let's talk a little
bit about architecture.

00:01:12.886 --> 00:01:16.436 A:middle
So you're already familiar with
watchOS apps for watchOS 1.

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.626 A:middle
The way that works was
you had a user interface

00:01:19.626 --> 00:01:21.596 A:middle
on both your iPhone
and Apple Watch.

00:01:22.086 --> 00:01:24.826 A:middle
So you have an iPhone app,

00:01:24.926 --> 00:01:27.976 A:middle
and inside of your iPhone app is
an Apple Watch that's packaged

00:01:27.976 --> 00:01:29.636 A:middle
as part of that Apple Watch app.

00:01:30.186 --> 00:01:33.776 A:middle
The UI, your storyboards,
your resources,

00:01:34.176 --> 00:01:36.436 A:middle
those exist on Apple Watch
and are installed there,

00:01:36.856 --> 00:01:38.336 A:middle
but your app extension
runs on iPhone.

00:01:39.046 --> 00:01:43.186 A:middle
The big change with watchOS 2
is that that app extension moves

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:45.256 A:middle
over and runs natively
on Apple Watch itself.

00:01:47.536 --> 00:01:50.556 A:middle
This gives you a few really
great benefits for your users,

00:01:51.016 --> 00:01:53.396 A:middle
the first of course is that
now that the user interface

00:01:53.396 --> 00:01:55.196 A:middle
and the back-end code is running

00:01:55.196 --> 00:01:58.316 A:middle
on the same device you can
provide much lower interaction

00:01:58.316 --> 00:02:01.806 A:middle
latencies making your apps far
more responsive for your users.



00:01:58.316 --> 00:02:01.806 A:middle
latencies making your apps far
more responsive for your users.

00:02:03.116 --> 00:02:05.516 A:middle
Of course this also enables
some really great new things

00:02:06.086 --> 00:02:08.346 A:middle
like running your app when
the iPhone is not present.

00:02:09.545 --> 00:02:12.426 A:middle
In order to make sure that that
can happen efficiently you need

00:02:12.426 --> 00:02:14.176 A:middle
to take some time
and figure out how

00:02:14.176 --> 00:02:16.926 A:middle
to move your application
logic into the app extension.

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:19.946 A:middle
If in watchOS 1 you
were spending a bunch

00:02:19.946 --> 00:02:23.726 A:middle
of time using open parent
application to run code

00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:26.396 A:middle
in your iPhone app you want
to try and refactor that logic

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:27.976 A:middle
and move it in the
extension yourself.

00:02:29.176 --> 00:02:30.426 A:middle
The more code you can get

00:02:30.426 --> 00:02:33.306 A:middle
in the app extension the more
standalone functionality you can

00:02:33.306 --> 00:02:35.546 A:middle
provide when the
iPhone is not present.

00:02:36.616 --> 00:02:37.686 A:middle
Of course the other big part

00:02:37.686 --> 00:02:39.506 A:middle
about stand-alone
functionality is

00:02:39.506 --> 00:02:43.156 A:middle
that Apple Watch can access the
network using tether-less Wi-Fi

00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:46.636 A:middle
so your applications can
get data off of HTTP servers

00:02:46.636 --> 00:02:48.736 A:middle
on the internet even when
the iPhone is not present.

00:02:49.656 --> 00:02:52.906 A:middle
If you're used to using NSURL
Session in your iOS apps,

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:54.976 A:middle
you already know how to
take advantage of this.

00:02:55.286 --> 00:02:56.396 A:middle
We'll talk more about
that later.

00:02:57.146 --> 00:02:58.716 A:middle
But first let's talk
about what's new

00:02:59.016 --> 00:03:00.306 A:middle
in the WatchKit framework
itself.



00:02:59.016 --> 00:03:00.306 A:middle
in the WatchKit framework
itself.

00:03:00.976 --> 00:03:04.086 A:middle
In addition to the big change of
moving the code to run natively

00:03:04.086 --> 00:03:06.736 A:middle
on Apple Watch, we've also
added a whole bunch of new stuff

00:03:06.736 --> 00:03:10.576 A:middle
into WatchKit to help you build
even cooler apps with watchOS 2.

00:03:11.646 --> 00:03:13.026 A:middle
To give you an idea of
some of those things,

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.876 A:middle
we've got a list here of
some of what we're going

00:03:14.876 --> 00:03:17.526 A:middle
to cover right now, we have
the digital crown support,

00:03:17.526 --> 00:03:18.506 A:middle
layout and animations.

00:03:18.746 --> 00:03:21.296 A:middle
A bunch of great stuff, so we'll
go through all of these now.

00:03:21.676 --> 00:03:23.516 A:middle
First off let's talk
about the Digital Crown,

00:03:24.056 --> 00:03:26.726 A:middle
this is the really unique
interaction mechanisms specific

00:03:26.726 --> 00:03:30.736 A:middle
to Apple Watch and you can
access this using a simple new

00:03:30.736 --> 00:03:32.246 A:middle
control that you can put

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:34.996 A:middle
into your storyboards
called wk interface picker.

00:03:36.236 --> 00:03:39.926 A:middle
The picker control is a
control that lets you scroll

00:03:39.926 --> 00:03:42.426 A:middle
through a list of elements
using the digital crown

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:43.416 A:middle
and choose one.

00:03:44.186 --> 00:03:45.986 A:middle
It has three different styles.

00:03:46.546 --> 00:03:47.526 A:middle
We'll talk through
each of those.

00:03:47.616 --> 00:03:50.216 A:middle
The first is the list style
that you can see here.

00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:53.156 A:middle
If you're familiar with
configuring complications

00:03:53.156 --> 00:03:55.466 A:middle
on the watch face you already
know what this looks like.

00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:59.926 A:middle
It is a list of items and it can
have the optional focus outline

00:03:59.926 --> 00:04:02.286 A:middle
around it and a caption
up at the top



00:03:59.926 --> 00:04:02.286 A:middle
around it and a caption
up at the top

00:04:02.486 --> 00:04:04.816 A:middle
that can give you more detail
about the selected item

00:04:04.816 --> 00:04:06.356 A:middle
in case it is not obvious

00:04:06.356 --> 00:04:08.586 A:middle
from the item itself
exactly what it means.

00:04:10.076 --> 00:04:11.576 A:middle
You can choose to
hide or show either

00:04:11.576 --> 00:04:12.916 A:middle
of those user interface
elements.

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:15.186 A:middle
If you have multiple
pickers onscreen

00:04:15.186 --> 00:04:18.255 A:middle
at the same time you probably
want to show the focus outline

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:19.565 A:middle
to make it clear to the user

00:04:19.565 --> 00:04:22.116 A:middle
when they turn the crown what's
going to end up happening.

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:27.876 A:middle
The second style
is the stack style.

00:04:28.926 --> 00:04:32.526 A:middle
The stack style provides
you with a list of images

00:04:32.656 --> 00:04:34.606 A:middle
that your user can scroll
through and pick one.

00:04:34.946 --> 00:04:37.106 A:middle
It has this really nice
transition automation

00:04:37.106 --> 00:04:39.866 A:middle
up while the other fades back.

00:04:39.866 --> 00:04:42.256 A:middle
Any content that you might
want to allow them to choose

00:04:42.256 --> 00:04:44.636 A:middle
from that you can represent
graphically you can use the

00:04:44.636 --> 00:04:45.556 A:middle
stack style for.

00:04:45.846 --> 00:04:46.856 A:middle
It looks really nice.

00:04:47.776 --> 00:04:49.936 A:middle
The third style is
the image sequence.

00:04:50.876 --> 00:04:53.886 A:middle
The image sequence style lets
you scroll through a list

00:04:53.886 --> 00:04:57.476 A:middle
of images but without any
transitions between them.

00:04:57.476 --> 00:04:59.746 A:middle
If you have something that looks
really natural as you just move

00:04:59.746 --> 00:05:02.096 A:middle
from one frame to the
next, you can use this one



00:04:59.746 --> 00:05:02.096 A:middle
from one frame to the
next, you can use this one

00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:03.726 A:middle
and you'll get a
nice way to pick

00:05:03.946 --> 00:05:05.516 A:middle
which image you want
to be able to use.

00:05:05.886 --> 00:05:09.076 A:middle
You can also see here
in the top right corner

00:05:09.446 --> 00:05:11.056 A:middle
that we have a scroll
indicator in this one.

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:14.556 A:middle
That's an optional user
interface element to put on any

00:05:14.556 --> 00:05:15.776 A:middle
of the three different styles.

00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:19.036 A:middle
You would want to use this in
cases where it is not obvious

00:05:19.036 --> 00:05:22.136 A:middle
from the content exactly
where the user is in the list

00:05:22.136 --> 00:05:23.736 A:middle
of content or how
many things there are.

00:05:24.296 --> 00:05:26.636 A:middle
For example, if you're letting
the user choose from a day --

00:05:26.746 --> 00:05:28.906 A:middle
from an hour out of the day,

00:05:29.456 --> 00:05:31.606 A:middle
you probably don't need
the scroll indicator

00:05:31.866 --> 00:05:34.276 A:middle
because the users likely
know how many hours there are

00:05:34.276 --> 00:05:36.156 A:middle
in a day and they can figure
out where they are in the list.

00:05:36.486 --> 00:05:37.906 A:middle
If you're doing something else

00:05:37.906 --> 00:05:39.756 A:middle
where it's not self-evident
how many things there are,

00:05:39.856 --> 00:05:42.726 A:middle
like choosing from emoji, you
might want to show the indicator

00:05:42.726 --> 00:05:44.566 A:middle
so that they have some
context of where they are

00:05:44.566 --> 00:05:47.976 A:middle
and how many options they have.

00:05:48.186 --> 00:05:49.976 A:middle
Now, in addition to
these three styles,

00:05:49.976 --> 00:05:53.276 A:middle
there is actually another
great feature of picker control

00:05:53.276 --> 00:05:55.796 A:middle
that gives you even more
flexibility in how this works

00:05:55.796 --> 00:05:56.856 A:middle
in your user interfaces.

00:05:57.326 --> 00:05:59.276 A:middle
That's called coordinated
images.

00:05:59.876 --> 00:06:01.416 A:middle
The really cool thing
about this,



00:05:59.876 --> 00:06:01.416 A:middle
The really cool thing
about this,

00:06:01.416 --> 00:06:03.746 A:middle
you can take an animated
image that you may have set

00:06:03.746 --> 00:06:06.416 A:middle
on some other interface element,
like the background of a group,

00:06:06.796 --> 00:06:10.496 A:middle
or some wk interface image and
you can set it to be coordinated

00:06:10.696 --> 00:06:12.076 A:middle
with the picker control itself.

00:06:12.626 --> 00:06:13.956 A:middle
This way as the user scrubs

00:06:14.026 --> 00:06:17.906 A:middle
through we'll adjust the frame
offset in the animated image

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:20.866 A:middle
to match the relative offset
in the items in the list.

00:06:21.346 --> 00:06:22.846 A:middle
That will let you
build user interfaces

00:06:22.846 --> 00:06:23.996 A:middle
that look something like this.

00:06:24.686 --> 00:06:26.716 A:middle
As the user goes through,
picks which minute,

00:06:26.716 --> 00:06:29.326 A:middle
you have a coordinated image in
the back that's filling a ring.

00:06:30.146 --> 00:06:32.876 A:middle
The combination of the different
styles lets you get some really

00:06:32.876 --> 00:06:35.246 A:middle
interesting, unique
interfaces all controlled

00:06:35.246 --> 00:06:36.136 A:middle
by the Digital Crown.

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:40.056 A:middle
Next up, let's talk about
animations and layout.

00:06:40.946 --> 00:06:43.786 A:middle
So as you know, you build your
user interfaces for watchOS

00:06:44.116 --> 00:06:45.506 A:middle
in storyboards in Xcode.

00:06:47.556 --> 00:06:51.036 A:middle
In Xcode you have a whole bunch
of different options you can set

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:53.086 A:middle
on the different interface
elements in your storyboard.

00:06:53.806 --> 00:06:56.126 A:middle
Now, in watchOS 1 there
were a lot of these

00:06:56.126 --> 00:06:57.466 A:middle
that you could change
programmatically

00:06:57.546 --> 00:06:59.696 A:middle
but some could only be set
within the storyboard itself.



00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:02.716 A:middle
In watchOS 2 we have gone
through and enhanced this

00:07:02.836 --> 00:07:04.546 A:middle
to add setters for
all of the items

00:07:04.636 --> 00:07:06.366 A:middle
that were previously
only settable

00:07:06.366 --> 00:07:08.356 A:middle
in Xcode at design time.

00:07:09.096 --> 00:07:11.806 A:middle
This lets you change a lot of
stuff in the program at runtime

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:13.296 A:middle
that previously had
to be static.

00:07:14.326 --> 00:07:18.576 A:middle
In addition we have added a new
animation API called animate

00:07:18.576 --> 00:07:21.396 A:middle
with duration that lets
you pass in a block

00:07:21.646 --> 00:07:23.256 A:middle
that can include changes
that you may have set

00:07:23.296 --> 00:07:24.346 A:middle
to your interface elements.

00:07:24.806 --> 00:07:27.076 A:middle
Anything that you change within
that block will get animated.

00:07:27.366 --> 00:07:29.976 A:middle
If you're familiar with UI kits
animation API you'll be right

00:07:29.976 --> 00:07:30.766 A:middle
at home with this one.

00:07:31.456 --> 00:07:34.416 A:middle
It lets you build a lot of cool,

00:07:34.416 --> 00:07:36.766 A:middle
smoother interfaces
with animation.

00:07:37.466 --> 00:07:38.776 A:middle
Now, there is so much
to talk about with

00:07:38.776 --> 00:07:41.216 A:middle
that that there is an entire
session covering layout

00:07:41.216 --> 00:07:42.756 A:middle
and animation techniques
for WatchKit,

00:07:42.756 --> 00:07:44.326 A:middle
so you should definitely
go check that out.

00:07:45.076 --> 00:07:46.846 A:middle
There is a lot of things
that may not be self-evident

00:07:46.846 --> 00:07:49.346 A:middle
and cool tricks and
tips to use these APIs

00:07:49.716 --> 00:07:50.926 A:middle
to get some really cool effects.

00:07:50.926 --> 00:07:52.756 A:middle
So if you come check that
out there will be a lot

00:07:52.756 --> 00:07:53.556 A:middle
of great stuff to see.

00:07:54.026 --> 00:07:56.986 A:middle
Next up, let's talk
about Taptic Engine,

00:07:57.646 --> 00:08:00.646 A:middle
this is another really
unique element on Apple Watch



00:07:57.646 --> 00:08:00.646 A:middle
this is another really
unique element on Apple Watch

00:08:00.846 --> 00:08:02.776 A:middle
that lets you get
information to your users

00:08:02.996 --> 00:08:05.746 A:middle
without actually having to have
them read it off the screen.

00:08:05.746 --> 00:08:06.736 A:middle
It is really great.

00:08:07.156 --> 00:08:10.166 A:middle
The cool thing about Taptic
Engine is your users will come

00:08:10.166 --> 00:08:13.796 A:middle
to know the feeling and
sound of individual haptics

00:08:14.086 --> 00:08:17.026 A:middle
and what those things mean in
the context of applications.

00:08:17.696 --> 00:08:19.126 A:middle
We have a great API
that is simple

00:08:19.126 --> 00:08:22.496 A:middle
that lets you just play
haptics on wk interface device,

00:08:22.496 --> 00:08:24.366 A:middle
you just call play
haptic, and there's a list

00:08:24.366 --> 00:08:26.746 A:middle
of different styles
you can choose from.

00:08:26.776 --> 00:08:29.416 A:middle
Each of these as I mentioned
has a particular intended use

00:08:29.416 --> 00:08:31.936 A:middle
and your users will come
to know what they mean

00:08:32.176 --> 00:08:34.176 A:middle
because the intent is
to deliver information

00:08:34.426 --> 00:08:35.866 A:middle
without them having
to read anything.

00:08:36.316 --> 00:08:38.476 A:middle
You want to make sure that
you use these consistently

00:08:38.775 --> 00:08:40.376 A:middle
and they're named in such
a way to help you figure

00:08:40.376 --> 00:08:42.096 A:middle
out how they should be used.

00:08:42.496 --> 00:08:44.746 A:middle
There is also really clear
documentation in the docs

00:08:44.746 --> 00:08:47.196 A:middle
about the intended use of
each and they're covered

00:08:47.196 --> 00:08:49.436 A:middle
in more depth in the
designing Apple Watch session.

00:08:49.856 --> 00:08:51.496 A:middle
So definitely check those
things out if you're going

00:08:51.496 --> 00:08:52.506 A:middle
to use haptics in your app

00:08:52.846 --> 00:08:54.406 A:middle
and make sure you
use them consistently

00:08:54.476 --> 00:08:56.446 A:middle
so that your users will
understand what's happening

00:08:56.446 --> 00:08:58.206 A:middle
without having to
look at the screen.

00:08:58.746 --> 00:09:03.916 A:middle
There is also a few other
pieces of hardware we wanted



00:08:58.746 --> 00:09:03.916 A:middle
There is also a few other
pieces of hardware we wanted

00:09:03.916 --> 00:09:05.466 A:middle
to enable access
to with WatchKit.

00:09:05.966 --> 00:09:07.496 A:middle
The first is the microphone.

00:09:08.396 --> 00:09:11.186 A:middle
So we've got a new API in
watchOS 2 that lets you bring

00:09:11.186 --> 00:09:14.926 A:middle
up this recording sheet, record
any audio that's going on,

00:09:15.336 --> 00:09:18.326 A:middle
play it back before
the user acts on it,

00:09:18.326 --> 00:09:19.766 A:middle
and then ultimately act

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:21.516 A:middle
by tapping the button
in the top right.

00:09:23.206 --> 00:09:25.766 A:middle
So the button in the top
right can be named based

00:09:25.766 --> 00:09:28.576 A:middle
on whatever is appropriate for
your application's context.

00:09:28.926 --> 00:09:30.096 A:middle
In this case I call it "send"

00:09:30.096 --> 00:09:31.836 A:middle
because I'm assuming I
might send a message.

00:09:32.196 --> 00:09:33.566 A:middle
But you might also
have it be "save"

00:09:33.566 --> 00:09:35.276 A:middle
if you were doing something
like a voice memo app.

00:09:36.716 --> 00:09:37.676 A:middle
It's really simple.

00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:40.176 A:middle
It records to a file and when
the user hits the confirmation

00:09:40.176 --> 00:09:43.006 A:middle
button you'll be handed
the file back to act on it

00:09:43.006 --> 00:09:45.196 A:middle
as whatever way is appropriate
for your application.

00:09:46.396 --> 00:09:48.746 A:middle
Of course, in addition to
the microphone, we also want

00:09:48.746 --> 00:09:50.026 A:middle
to enable access to the speaker.

00:09:50.026 --> 00:09:53.046 A:middle
We have done that in a way
that lets you play back audio

00:09:53.046 --> 00:09:55.116 A:middle
and video content in
your applications.

00:09:55.856 --> 00:09:58.616 A:middle
There is three APIs that
enable this in different ways.

00:09:59.286 --> 00:10:02.286 A:middle
The first one is a new
interface object called wk



00:09:59.286 --> 00:10:02.286 A:middle
The first one is a new
interface object called wk

00:10:02.286 --> 00:10:03.266 A:middle
interface movie.

00:10:04.446 --> 00:10:06.926 A:middle
This element lets you get a
really standard appearance

00:10:07.176 --> 00:10:10.226 A:middle
for what it would look like in
your app to see a video file

00:10:10.226 --> 00:10:11.046 A:middle
and start its playback.

00:10:11.726 --> 00:10:13.516 A:middle
In this case you see
I have two onscreen.

00:10:13.846 --> 00:10:15.056 A:middle
You provide a poster image,

00:10:15.406 --> 00:10:17.446 A:middle
a URL where your
content is located,

00:10:17.776 --> 00:10:19.176 A:middle
and WatchKit handles
playback for you.

00:10:19.646 --> 00:10:21.316 A:middle
That URL can be a local file

00:10:21.316 --> 00:10:23.186 A:middle
if you've already gotten
the content onto the watch

00:10:23.386 --> 00:10:26.626 A:middle
or it can be a remote HTTP URL
if it is not already local.

00:10:27.096 --> 00:10:28.876 A:middle
If you provide a
remote resource,

00:10:29.116 --> 00:10:31.466 A:middle
WatchKit will handle
downloading it, showing progress

00:10:31.606 --> 00:10:33.966 A:middle
and then ultimately playing once
the resource was downloaded.

00:10:34.466 --> 00:10:36.906 A:middle
If it's local, playback
will start really quickly.

00:10:38.306 --> 00:10:40.406 A:middle
When the user taps on the
play button they're going

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:43.316 A:middle
to be presented with a great
full-screen view of that video

00:10:43.586 --> 00:10:45.746 A:middle
and it's going to play back
taking up the whole screen

00:10:46.096 --> 00:10:48.986 A:middle
with playback controls that fade
out right away to give access

00:10:49.066 --> 00:10:50.936 A:middle
to quick view into
the full content.

00:10:53.516 --> 00:10:56.066 A:middle
Additionally, if you want to
start playback some way other

00:10:56.066 --> 00:10:58.756 A:middle
than the standard interface
element there is also an API

00:10:58.756 --> 00:11:00.826 A:middle
that lets you just present
that controller directly



00:10:58.756 --> 00:11:00.826 A:middle
that lets you just present
that controller directly

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:01.976 A:middle
from some other interaction.

00:11:05.056 --> 00:11:08.456 A:middle
These APIs play video and
audio content and they're best

00:11:08.456 --> 00:11:10.026 A:middle
for playing back short content.

00:11:10.396 --> 00:11:12.776 A:middle
The watch is designed
for short interaction.

00:11:13.546 --> 00:11:14.326 A:middle
So the best kind of content

00:11:14.326 --> 00:11:17.076 A:middle
to play here is something that's
not going to be very long.

00:11:17.286 --> 00:11:19.466 A:middle
You probably don't want to
be playing a two-hour movie

00:11:19.676 --> 00:11:22.956 A:middle
on Apple Watch this way.

00:11:23.056 --> 00:11:25.896 A:middle
Sometimes there are some types
of audio content that are longer

00:11:25.896 --> 00:11:26.856 A:middle
that you do want to play back.

00:11:27.286 --> 00:11:30.016 A:middle
If you're writing something
like a podcasting application,

00:11:30.266 --> 00:11:33.366 A:middle
you might want to download some
podcasts and then go for a run,

00:11:33.366 --> 00:11:35.186 A:middle
listen to them on your
Bluetooth headphones.

00:11:35.686 --> 00:11:38.086 A:middle
We've got another API
that is really great

00:11:38.086 --> 00:11:40.116 A:middle
for playing back
this long-form audio.

00:11:40.826 --> 00:11:43.826 A:middle
If you're familiar with the AV
foundation APIs you know how

00:11:43.826 --> 00:11:44.406 A:middle
to use these.

00:11:44.446 --> 00:11:45.616 A:middle
They're very, very similar.

00:11:46.486 --> 00:11:49.396 A:middle
The one difference between
this and the AV foundation APIs

00:11:49.396 --> 00:11:52.956 A:middle
that you might know from
iOS is that in order

00:11:53.096 --> 00:11:55.486 A:middle
to enable really
high performance

00:11:55.486 --> 00:11:59.566 A:middle
and great battery usage for
the app it doesn't require

00:11:59.566 --> 00:12:01.696 A:middle
that your application continue
to run in the background



00:11:59.566 --> 00:12:01.696 A:middle
that your application continue
to run in the background

00:12:01.696 --> 00:12:03.116 A:middle
in order to play
back that audio.

00:12:03.516 --> 00:12:05.126 A:middle
The file can be handed
off to the system

00:12:05.316 --> 00:12:07.626 A:middle
to be played back even when
your application is suspended

00:12:07.626 --> 00:12:08.236 A:middle
and not running.

00:12:08.236 --> 00:12:12.906 A:middle
If the user goes to the watch
face while out for a run,

00:12:12.906 --> 00:12:14.666 A:middle
they can bring up the
now playing glance

00:12:14.856 --> 00:12:16.536 A:middle
and control the playback
of the audio that's

00:12:16.536 --> 00:12:19.176 A:middle
from your application even while
your application is not running.

00:12:19.746 --> 00:12:25.536 A:middle
So there is a few other
APIs that are not related

00:12:25.536 --> 00:12:27.456 A:middle
to hardware things that I still
want to go over quickly here.

00:12:28.196 --> 00:12:29.976 A:middle
The first one here is alerts.

00:12:30.286 --> 00:12:33.046 A:middle
Again, I mentioned Apple
Watch is really designed

00:12:33.046 --> 00:12:35.476 A:middle
for short interactions,
so you probably want

00:12:35.476 --> 00:12:38.246 A:middle
to be really careful about
not over using this API

00:12:38.576 --> 00:12:40.386 A:middle
because it does introduce
an additional step

00:12:40.466 --> 00:12:43.516 A:middle
into some other work
flow in your app.

00:12:44.106 --> 00:12:45.556 A:middle
There are some times
when you just need

00:12:45.556 --> 00:12:46.636 A:middle
to ask the user a question

00:12:46.636 --> 00:12:48.136 A:middle
to get an answer
before you proceed.

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:50.106 A:middle
For those cases, we
have the alert API

00:12:50.546 --> 00:12:53.416 A:middle
which gives you a consistent
appearance for this style of UI.

00:12:54.426 --> 00:12:56.766 A:middle
You provide a title, a
description, then the list

00:12:56.766 --> 00:12:59.506 A:middle
of buttons and the actions that
should be taken in a block.



00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:02.276 A:middle
They'll just be displayed
and you get called back

00:13:02.276 --> 00:13:03.406 A:middle
when the user taps
on one of them.

00:13:03.756 --> 00:13:07.486 A:middle
In this case I have included a
destructive style button making

00:13:07.516 --> 00:13:09.086 A:middle
it clear that something
destructive will happen

00:13:09.086 --> 00:13:09.986 A:middle
when I tap delete here.

00:13:10.556 --> 00:13:15.676 A:middle
We have a great open
system URL API

00:13:16.106 --> 00:13:17.806 A:middle
which enable a whole
bunch of new things.

00:13:18.236 --> 00:13:22.356 A:middle
Open system URL can take
another URL and sends the user

00:13:22.356 --> 00:13:24.356 A:middle
to the messages application
to send an iMessage

00:13:24.356 --> 00:13:26.926 A:middle
to some recipient that
you've defined in your app

00:13:28.276 --> 00:13:31.586 A:middle
and even cooler, you can
pass tel URLs you can have

00:13:31.676 --> 00:13:34.866 A:middle
from your application a phone
call started on Apple Watch.

00:13:35.646 --> 00:13:38.426 A:middle
When that happens, the in-call
UI will show up over your app,

00:13:38.426 --> 00:13:41.926 A:middle
the user can make the phone
call, as soon as they hang up,

00:13:41.926 --> 00:13:44.286 A:middle
they'll be right back
where they left the app

00:13:44.396 --> 00:13:48.746 A:middle
when they started the call.

00:13:48.966 --> 00:13:51.806 A:middle
We also have integration
with Passbook -- PassKit.

00:13:52.476 --> 00:13:55.616 A:middle
In fact, the PassKit framework
is part of the watchOS

00:13:56.806 --> 00:13:58.546 A:middle
so you can get access
to the passes

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:01.126 A:middle
that your application
may have on iPhone.



00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:01.126 A:middle
that your application
may have on iPhone.

00:14:01.396 --> 00:14:03.366 A:middle
The pass library is
synchronized between iPhone

00:14:03.366 --> 00:14:04.366 A:middle
and watch so you get both.

00:14:04.366 --> 00:14:08.676 A:middle
Even better, WatchKit now has
an API that lets you add passes

00:14:08.726 --> 00:14:11.226 A:middle
to the pass library,
you hand your PK pass

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:13.726 A:middle
over to the WatchKit API,
it presents this way,

00:14:13.816 --> 00:14:17.046 A:middle
the user can scroll through
it to check out what is

00:14:17.046 --> 00:14:19.466 A:middle
in that pass and all the way
at the bottom is an add button

00:14:19.716 --> 00:14:20.926 A:middle
to add it to the library.

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:23.506 A:middle
When they tap that, it will
be added to the library

00:14:23.506 --> 00:14:25.796 A:middle
on Apple Watch, but
also on iPhone

00:14:25.796 --> 00:14:27.966 A:middle
and all their other devices that
are synchronized through iCloud.

00:14:28.806 --> 00:14:32.176 A:middle
So it's a really great way to
get an end to end pass story all

00:14:32.176 --> 00:14:34.566 A:middle
on Apple Watch, from
ingestion all the way

00:14:34.566 --> 00:14:38.596 A:middle
through to using the pass later.

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:40.486 A:middle
So that's what's
new in WatchKit,

00:14:40.486 --> 00:14:42.066 A:middle
there is a whole
bunch of stuff there.

00:14:42.786 --> 00:14:45.116 A:middle
As I mentioned, WatchKit
is just one part

00:14:45.296 --> 00:14:49.096 A:middle
of the overall watchOS STK and
there are other frameworks,

00:14:49.186 --> 00:14:52.936 A:middle
some are new and
some that existed

00:14:52.936 --> 00:14:54.166 A:middle
and have some new functionality.

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:57.216 A:middle
I would like to talk through
a few of the other ones now.

00:14:57.466 --> 00:15:00.066 A:middle
Starting with two that are
specific just to watchOS.



00:14:57.466 --> 00:15:00.066 A:middle
Starting with two that are
specific just to watchOS.

00:15:00.936 --> 00:15:03.566 A:middle
The first is Clock Kit.

00:15:05.076 --> 00:15:08.506 A:middle
So Clock Kit is a
framework giving up access

00:15:08.786 --> 00:15:12.586 A:middle
to building complications that
show up right on the watch face.

00:15:12.836 --> 00:15:14.606 A:middle
It is a great way to
get your data in front

00:15:14.606 --> 00:15:16.116 A:middle
of the users really,
really quickly.

00:15:18.736 --> 00:15:20.826 A:middle
There is a few styles
of complications,

00:15:21.116 --> 00:15:22.526 A:middle
and Clock Kit supports
all of them.

00:15:22.946 --> 00:15:24.726 A:middle
And to give you an idea
of what that is let's look

00:15:24.726 --> 00:15:26.396 A:middle
through the watch
faces, see what they are.

00:15:27.246 --> 00:15:29.386 A:middle
Here we have our utility face

00:15:29.386 --> 00:15:31.476 A:middle
and there are three different
complications visible

00:15:31.476 --> 00:15:33.526 A:middle
on this face right now.

00:15:33.566 --> 00:15:37.856 A:middle
You see complications with
different sizes and shapes

00:15:38.186 --> 00:15:40.676 A:middle
and Clock Kit supports
formatting the data

00:15:40.676 --> 00:15:42.596 A:middle
in the appropriate
way to display in each

00:15:42.596 --> 00:15:44.276 A:middle
of these complications.

00:15:45.146 --> 00:15:47.156 A:middle
If we look at our
color face for example,

00:15:47.506 --> 00:15:50.656 A:middle
this has more square sized
complications and they're taller

00:15:50.746 --> 00:15:53.626 A:middle
to display two lines
of text or an image.

00:15:54.606 --> 00:15:57.346 A:middle
Finally, on the digital
modular face we have our biggest

00:15:57.346 --> 00:16:00.156 A:middle
complication right in the center
and four others are on the edge.



00:15:57.346 --> 00:16:00.156 A:middle
complication right in the center
and four others are on the edge.

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:03.936 A:middle
Clock Kit provides some great
APIs to let you format your data

00:16:04.416 --> 00:16:06.506 A:middle
in various different
templates to fit all

00:16:06.506 --> 00:16:10.026 A:middle
of these different
appearances and tailoring it

00:16:10.806 --> 00:16:13.606 A:middle
to show the right amount of
data given each particular

00:16:13.606 --> 00:16:14.686 A:middle
complication size.

00:16:15.286 --> 00:16:18.726 A:middle
Now the other important
thing about complications,

00:16:18.996 --> 00:16:20.716 A:middle
is that they're right
on your watch face

00:16:21.076 --> 00:16:23.196 A:middle
which means every time the user
raises their wrist and looks

00:16:23.196 --> 00:16:25.216 A:middle
at the watch, they
want to see the most

00:16:25.216 --> 00:16:26.676 A:middle
up to date data right away.

00:16:27.406 --> 00:16:30.696 A:middle
If we had to every time the user
raises the wrist ask the code

00:16:30.696 --> 00:16:32.446 A:middle
to give the current
value to be shown,

00:16:32.786 --> 00:16:33.866 A:middle
we would already have failed.

00:16:34.366 --> 00:16:38.226 A:middle
It needs to be there immediately
before the user even raises

00:16:38.226 --> 00:16:38.686 A:middle
their wrist.

00:16:39.176 --> 00:16:42.196 A:middle
In order to facilitate that,
you provide your app's data

00:16:42.196 --> 00:16:44.486 A:middle
to Clock Kit in the
form of a timeline.

00:16:45.266 --> 00:16:49.036 A:middle
In this case, I've got the data
for the WWDC app in the form

00:16:49.036 --> 00:16:50.566 A:middle
of a complication
and timeline here.

00:16:51.186 --> 00:16:52.706 A:middle
If this were 10:00 a.m.,

00:16:53.046 --> 00:16:55.416 A:middle
the morning of the
keynote it might be showing

00:16:55.416 --> 00:16:57.216 A:middle
that the keynote is the
current session coming up.

00:16:58.686 --> 00:17:01.926 A:middle
As the day progresses,
let's say it becomes 2:00



00:16:58.686 --> 00:17:01.926 A:middle
As the day progresses,
let's say it becomes 2:00

00:17:01.986 --> 00:17:04.415 A:middle
and it already has the
data so Clock Kit chooses

00:17:04.415 --> 00:17:06.506 A:middle
to show the appropriate
thing for that time of day.

00:17:06.566 --> 00:17:08.586 A:middle
It would have moved to the
platform state of the union.

00:17:09.165 --> 00:17:11.586 A:middle
Moving on to 4:00,
Apple Design Awards.

00:17:12.386 --> 00:17:16.336 A:middle
The great thing with
this format,

00:17:16.336 --> 00:17:18.846 A:middle
you get the automatic
behavior throughout the day

00:17:18.846 --> 00:17:21.945 A:middle
without the code having to run
all the time, but you also get

00:17:21.945 --> 00:17:23.445 A:middle
to participate in time travel

00:17:23.445 --> 00:17:25.296 A:middle
without any additional
effort on your part.

00:17:25.336 --> 00:17:28.286 A:middle
If the user turned the
digital crown to move backwards

00:17:28.286 --> 00:17:30.206 A:middle
and see what was happening
earlier in the day,

00:17:30.646 --> 00:17:33.476 A:middle
clock kit would just switch to
showing the appropriate piece

00:17:33.476 --> 00:17:36.226 A:middle
of your data for
that point in time.

00:17:36.226 --> 00:17:38.946 A:middle
Really, really easy to add
support for complications

00:17:39.186 --> 00:17:40.976 A:middle
and a really powerful
way to get your data

00:17:41.106 --> 00:17:42.226 A:middle
in front of your users.

00:17:42.766 --> 00:17:43.956 A:middle
That's Clock Kit.

00:17:43.956 --> 00:17:47.946 A:middle
There is a whole session that
goes into a lot of this in a ton

00:17:47.946 --> 00:17:50.076 A:middle
of detail and tells
you all about the APIs,

00:17:50.076 --> 00:17:52.756 A:middle
different templates, everything
you need to get started.

00:17:53.126 --> 00:17:55.906 A:middle
Check out Creating
Complications with Clock Kit.

00:17:57.556 --> 00:18:01.056 A:middle
The next thing I want to
talk about, networking.



00:17:57.556 --> 00:18:01.056 A:middle
The next thing I want to
talk about, networking.

00:18:01.116 --> 00:18:05.126 A:middle
Networking is an important story
now that you have code running

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:07.026 A:middle
on both Apple Watch and iPhone.

00:18:07.096 --> 00:18:11.006 A:middle
There is two kinds of
networking you may wanted

00:18:11.006 --> 00:18:12.066 A:middle
to do in your applications.

00:18:12.486 --> 00:18:14.596 A:middle
The first of those is
you may want to talk

00:18:14.936 --> 00:18:16.336 A:middle
to the broader internet.

00:18:17.816 --> 00:18:19.756 A:middle
The way you can do
that when you're

00:18:19.756 --> 00:18:22.906 A:middle
in either a stand alone mode or
when your watch and phone are

00:18:22.906 --> 00:18:25.996 A:middle
in the same place, using
the NSURL session APIs.

00:18:27.656 --> 00:18:28.776 A:middle
These will get to the internet

00:18:28.776 --> 00:18:31.616 A:middle
in the most efficient way
possible given how your user is

00:18:31.616 --> 00:18:35.146 A:middle
currently using the phone
including detect over Wi-Fi

00:18:35.146 --> 00:18:37.226 A:middle
with tether-less Wi-Fi when
the phone is not present.

00:18:37.226 --> 00:18:42.606 A:middle
There is a whole session to
talk about NSURL session.

00:18:42.866 --> 00:18:45.946 A:middle
Networking with NSURL session
so go check that one out.

00:18:46.486 --> 00:18:49.736 A:middle
Any server anywhere
on the internet, hit,

00:18:49.736 --> 00:18:53.636 A:middle
download the data, it is the
same API you're used to using

00:18:53.636 --> 00:18:56.686 A:middle
if you used it on iOS and
it has all the same set

00:18:56.686 --> 00:18:58.816 A:middle
of features including
background downloads.

00:18:59.386 --> 00:19:04.436 A:middle
Of course, there are some times
where you have code now running



00:18:59.386 --> 00:19:04.436 A:middle
Of course, there are some times
where you have code now running

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:06.776 A:middle
on both Apple Watch
and iPhone and you want

00:19:06.776 --> 00:19:08.626 A:middle
to have them share data
or talk to each other.

00:19:09.586 --> 00:19:12.826 A:middle
We have provided a brand-new
framework for watchOS

00:19:12.826 --> 00:19:14.926 A:middle
and iOS called watch
connectivity

00:19:15.236 --> 00:19:16.756 A:middle
that allows you to do just that.

00:19:16.876 --> 00:19:19.706 A:middle
Your iPhone can link watch
connectivity while running

00:19:19.706 --> 00:19:22.546 A:middle
on your iPhone and your watch
app can link watch connectivity

00:19:22.586 --> 00:19:23.386 A:middle
running on your watch.

00:19:23.966 --> 00:19:29.186 A:middle
So a good example of when
you may want to use something

00:19:29.186 --> 00:19:31.676 A:middle
like this is when you're
downloading data off the

00:19:31.676 --> 00:19:34.886 A:middle
internet, such as if you
were building a weather app

00:19:34.986 --> 00:19:37.016 A:middle
downloading the current
weather information.

00:19:37.816 --> 00:19:39.756 A:middle
Let's say your user
picks up their iPhone

00:19:40.046 --> 00:19:42.056 A:middle
and launches the app,
you go to the internet,

00:19:42.176 --> 00:19:45.016 A:middle
grab the latest weather, you
show it to them on their iPhone.

00:19:45.846 --> 00:19:48.926 A:middle
If you didn't do anything
else, you built the watch app

00:19:48.926 --> 00:19:51.566 A:middle
to do the same thing, the next
time they looked at the app

00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:53.536 A:middle
on the watch, it goes
out to the internet,

00:19:53.536 --> 00:19:55.286 A:middle
download the latest
data and show it there.

00:19:56.496 --> 00:19:58.116 A:middle
But that's not the
best we could do,

00:19:58.116 --> 00:19:59.216 A:middle
we could definitely do better.

00:19:59.456 --> 00:20:02.256 A:middle
We had the data, we just got
it on the iPhone and it's



00:19:59.456 --> 00:20:02.256 A:middle
We had the data, we just got
it on the iPhone and it's

00:20:02.256 --> 00:20:04.696 A:middle
in the user's pocket now.

00:20:05.046 --> 00:20:06.636 A:middle
It would be really great
if we could find some way

00:20:06.636 --> 00:20:07.706 A:middle
to take advantage of the fact

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:10.116 A:middle
that we already downloaded
our data on one of our devices

00:20:10.116 --> 00:20:12.136 A:middle
and not have to do
it multiple times.

00:20:13.116 --> 00:20:15.146 A:middle
To facilitate that, that might
look something like this.

00:20:15.146 --> 00:20:18.516 A:middle
The user downloads the data on
their iPhone, you move it over,

00:20:18.516 --> 00:20:22.556 A:middle
keep it available on the
watch so if the user then goes

00:20:22.556 --> 00:20:25.686 A:middle
and looks at the app on their
watch the data is already there

00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:28.406 A:middle
and it can be displayed without
having to be downloaded again.

00:20:29.326 --> 00:20:30.506 A:middle
Of course you may still go out

00:20:30.506 --> 00:20:32.516 A:middle
and download the more
recent updated version.

00:20:32.756 --> 00:20:33.876 A:middle
If you knew, for example,

00:20:33.876 --> 00:20:36.366 A:middle
that the weather data is only
updating data once an hour,

00:20:36.626 --> 00:20:39.526 A:middle
you might have the newest
data and not have to do that.

00:20:39.526 --> 00:20:42.586 A:middle
You may have something
newer available

00:20:42.586 --> 00:20:43.646 A:middle
for display right away.

00:20:45.026 --> 00:20:47.646 A:middle
Watch connectivity
provides this functionality.

00:20:48.366 --> 00:20:50.076 A:middle
There are two APIs
that it provides

00:20:50.076 --> 00:20:52.816 A:middle
for background downloading,

00:20:53.126 --> 00:20:55.946 A:middle
the first is called application
context and what it does,

00:20:55.946 --> 00:20:58.786 A:middle
it lets you hand over a
dictionary of data that you want

00:20:58.786 --> 00:20:59.906 A:middle
to have available in your app

00:20:59.906 --> 00:21:01.936 A:middle
on the other side
whenever it runs next.



00:20:59.906 --> 00:21:01.936 A:middle
on the other side
whenever it runs next.

00:21:02.626 --> 00:21:05.716 A:middle
It's always got the
latest version of the data

00:21:05.716 --> 00:21:07.246 A:middle
so you just set whatever
is current

00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:08.946 A:middle
and the next time
your application runs,

00:21:08.946 --> 00:21:10.476 A:middle
it will be available over there.

00:21:11.116 --> 00:21:12.066 A:middle
Behind the scenes,

00:21:12.236 --> 00:21:13.766 A:middle
watch connectivity
will transfer the data

00:21:13.906 --> 00:21:16.736 A:middle
at the time that's most power
and performance efficient.

00:21:17.936 --> 00:21:21.226 A:middle
There is also a file transfer
API, if you have larger data,

00:21:21.226 --> 00:21:24.846 A:middle
more bits of data you can
transfer files from your iPhone

00:21:24.846 --> 00:21:26.656 A:middle
to your watch and vice versa.

00:21:27.116 --> 00:21:29.676 A:middle
Again, it will do it in
the background in the times

00:21:29.676 --> 00:21:31.946 A:middle
that are most power and
performance efficient.

00:21:32.596 --> 00:21:35.966 A:middle
There are also times when you
need interactive messaging

00:21:35.966 --> 00:21:38.006 A:middle
between the two sides.

00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:40.716 A:middle
If your watch app is going
to kick off some operation

00:21:40.716 --> 00:21:43.026 A:middle
on your iPhone, you may
want to send a message over.

00:21:43.026 --> 00:21:46.586 A:middle
In this example I've got
a go button on my watch.

00:21:46.926 --> 00:21:49.366 A:middle
When I tap it, I want to
send a message to the iPhone

00:21:50.636 --> 00:21:53.436 A:middle
and what will happen is if
your app is not already running

00:21:53.436 --> 00:21:55.316 A:middle
on the iPhone it will get
launched in the background

00:21:55.546 --> 00:21:56.756 A:middle
and the message will
be delivered

00:21:56.756 --> 00:21:58.716 A:middle
so you could do something
like start a session

00:21:59.156 --> 00:22:00.966 A:middle
or perform some activity
on the iPhone.



00:21:59.156 --> 00:22:00.966 A:middle
or perform some activity
on the iPhone.

00:22:00.966 --> 00:22:04.726 A:middle
Now I mentioned that these
APIs exist on both sides

00:22:04.726 --> 00:22:05.816 A:middle
and they are bi-directional,

00:22:06.206 --> 00:22:08.066 A:middle
application context
can go both ways,

00:22:08.526 --> 00:22:11.456 A:middle
the file transfer APIs can
transfer files both ways.

00:22:12.046 --> 00:22:14.026 A:middle
One difference is in
the send message API.

00:22:14.886 --> 00:22:16.896 A:middle
When sending a message from
the watch to the iPhone,

00:22:16.896 --> 00:22:19.256 A:middle
it can wake your application
in the background on the iPhone

00:22:19.256 --> 00:22:20.276 A:middle
to perform some activity.

00:22:20.876 --> 00:22:22.936 A:middle
However when going the
other way from iPhone

00:22:22.936 --> 00:22:25.676 A:middle
to watch it won't wake up
the watch in the background.

00:22:25.936 --> 00:22:27.886 A:middle
Your app has to be running
on the watch in order

00:22:27.886 --> 00:22:30.276 A:middle
to receive messages
coming in from the iPhone.

00:22:31.676 --> 00:22:34.496 A:middle
There is a ton of detail to
be had on all of these APIs

00:22:34.496 --> 00:22:35.466 A:middle
and there is a whole session

00:22:35.466 --> 00:22:37.666 A:middle
about it called Introducing
Watch Connectivity,

00:22:38.106 --> 00:22:40.176 A:middle
so you should definitely
check that out to learn how

00:22:40.176 --> 00:22:44.196 A:middle
to move your back end from
a situation where it ran

00:22:44.266 --> 00:22:46.906 A:middle
on one device into
having your code running

00:22:46.906 --> 00:22:48.796 A:middle
on both iPhone and Apple Watch.

00:22:49.366 --> 00:22:55.616 A:middle
So those are the three new
frameworks that are brand-new

00:22:55.616 --> 00:22:57.506 A:middle
and specific to watchOS.

00:22:57.896 --> 00:23:00.306 A:middle
There is a bunch much
frameworks that exist on iOS



00:22:57.896 --> 00:23:00.306 A:middle
There is a bunch much
frameworks that exist on iOS

00:23:00.696 --> 00:23:02.776 A:middle
that you're used to
using in the apps today

00:23:03.186 --> 00:23:04.816 A:middle
that have some new functionality

00:23:05.056 --> 00:23:07.986 A:middle
or some enhanced functionality
specific to Apple Watch.

00:23:08.596 --> 00:23:10.326 A:middle
I would like to go over
a few of those right now.

00:23:11.206 --> 00:23:12.716 A:middle
The first is Core Motion.

00:23:13.786 --> 00:23:17.526 A:middle
Now, Core Motion, as you know,
is the API giving you access

00:23:17.526 --> 00:23:20.156 A:middle
to the motion sensors
in the iOS devices.

00:23:20.686 --> 00:23:22.436 A:middle
It also exists on watchOS

00:23:22.476 --> 00:23:24.156 A:middle
and gives you access
to the accelerometer.

00:23:24.996 --> 00:23:28.446 A:middle
As on iOS, on watchOS Core
Motion can give you live data

00:23:28.446 --> 00:23:32.536 A:middle
while the application is
running, but new and cool

00:23:32.536 --> 00:23:36.746 A:middle
and specific to Apple Watch
is it also records motion data

00:23:36.746 --> 00:23:38.646 A:middle
on your applications behalf even

00:23:38.646 --> 00:23:42.186 A:middle
when your application is not
running at a lower refresh rate

00:23:42.496 --> 00:23:44.446 A:middle
and then give that
accelerometer data to you

00:23:44.446 --> 00:23:46.526 A:middle
in a batch the next time
your application runs.

00:23:47.586 --> 00:23:50.516 A:middle
Cool way to get insight
into the motion

00:23:50.856 --> 00:23:52.406 A:middle
when the app is not running.

00:23:53.456 --> 00:23:56.376 A:middle
There is a whole talk about
this, What's New in Core Motion,

00:23:56.546 --> 00:23:59.026 A:middle
so you should definitely
go check that out.

00:23:59.176 --> 00:24:01.786 A:middle
Additionally, core location
is part of the watch iOS



00:23:59.176 --> 00:24:01.786 A:middle
Additionally, core location
is part of the watch iOS

00:24:02.396 --> 00:24:06.096 A:middle
and there is a great way to find
out the user's new location,

00:24:06.646 --> 00:24:12.246 A:middle
there is a great thing making
it super easy to figure

00:24:12.246 --> 00:24:15.286 A:middle
out the current location
with just a simple API call.

00:24:15.946 --> 00:24:19.316 A:middle
Now, the other thing to
note about core location

00:24:19.316 --> 00:24:24.446 A:middle
on watchOS is that watch is
location authorization is shared

00:24:24.446 --> 00:24:26.616 A:middle
between your iOS app
running on the iPhone

00:24:26.926 --> 00:24:29.156 A:middle
and the watchOS app
running on the Apple Watch.

00:24:30.006 --> 00:24:32.696 A:middle
As you know, when you go to
use core location you have

00:24:32.696 --> 00:24:34.396 A:middle
to request location
authorization

00:24:34.396 --> 00:24:37.206 A:middle
from the user before the app is
allowed to find out location.

00:24:37.646 --> 00:24:39.186 A:middle
That's true in Apple
Watch as well.

00:24:39.896 --> 00:24:43.176 A:middle
Once you have -- once the user
accepted the authorization

00:24:43.176 --> 00:24:46.406 A:middle
on the iPhone or watch,
it applies to both

00:24:46.796 --> 00:24:48.466 A:middle
so they won't have to
answer the question twice

00:24:48.716 --> 00:24:50.286 A:middle
and there is one way to manage

00:24:50.286 --> 00:24:51.846 A:middle
that authorization
for the users.

00:24:51.846 --> 00:24:56.206 A:middle
There is a whole session
on core location what's new

00:24:56.206 --> 00:25:00.116 A:middle
in core location, a lot of
new stuff to learn on that.



00:24:56.206 --> 00:25:00.116 A:middle
in core location, a lot of
new stuff to learn on that.

00:25:00.576 --> 00:25:01.486 A:middle
Next up is HealthKit.

00:25:02.436 --> 00:25:05.886 A:middle
HealthKit is also part of
watchOS, same framework

00:25:05.886 --> 00:25:08.256 A:middle
with the same set of APIs
you're used to using on iOS.

00:25:09.456 --> 00:25:13.276 A:middle
The great thing about using
HealthKit on watchOS is so much

00:25:13.276 --> 00:25:15.876 A:middle
of the health data
recorded is being recorded

00:25:15.876 --> 00:25:19.666 A:middle
on the watch itself that you now
have even more up-to-date live

00:25:19.666 --> 00:25:22.516 A:middle
access to the data as it is
coming in on the watch itself.

00:25:22.936 --> 00:25:25.016 A:middle
You're now running on the
same device that's generating

00:25:25.016 --> 00:25:25.286 A:middle
that data.

00:25:26.876 --> 00:25:29.856 A:middle
So for example you have
really up-to-date heart rate

00:25:29.856 --> 00:25:31.676 A:middle
information as it
is being recorded

00:25:31.676 --> 00:25:32.426 A:middle
and stored in HealthKit.

00:25:33.596 --> 00:25:34.756 A:middle
The other great thing
about HealthKit

00:25:34.756 --> 00:25:37.036 A:middle
and watchOS is it provides API

00:25:37.696 --> 00:25:39.816 A:middle
that lets you start
workout sessions.

00:25:40.596 --> 00:25:43.976 A:middle
These workout sessions can do a
lot of the same kinds of things

00:25:44.276 --> 00:25:48.456 A:middle
that the workout app
on watch itself can do.

00:25:48.556 --> 00:25:50.796 A:middle
For example, if you
go start a run,

00:25:50.796 --> 00:25:52.456 A:middle
you want to record
the user's heart rate

00:25:52.456 --> 00:25:55.426 A:middle
at a higher frequency, you can
use the HealthKit API to start

00:25:55.426 --> 00:25:58.316 A:middle
that session and request
the heart rate information

00:25:58.316 --> 00:26:00.616 A:middle
to be recorded in
high frequency.



00:25:58.316 --> 00:26:00.616 A:middle
to be recorded in
high frequency.

00:26:01.946 --> 00:26:03.766 A:middle
The other great thing
about using this API

00:26:04.176 --> 00:26:07.926 A:middle
for your workout applications
is it allows the application

00:26:07.926 --> 00:26:10.096 A:middle
to continue to come back to
the foreground every time

00:26:10.096 --> 00:26:13.416 A:middle
that the user raises a
wrist in that session.

00:26:13.466 --> 00:26:15.086 A:middle
If you're writing a biking app

00:26:15.216 --> 00:26:17.396 A:middle
and the user starts
the biking session,

00:26:17.996 --> 00:26:19.666 A:middle
every time they raise
the wrist while

00:26:19.666 --> 00:26:22.836 A:middle
in that session they'll see the
app and be able to get the most

00:26:22.836 --> 00:26:26.866 A:middle
up to date data to find out
how they're doing during

00:26:27.436 --> 00:26:28.296 A:middle
the workout.

00:26:28.406 --> 00:26:30.806 A:middle
Now, while the user has dropped
the wrist and the screen is off,

00:26:30.806 --> 00:26:32.526 A:middle
the application is suspended

00:26:33.136 --> 00:26:36.316 A:middle
but HealthKit behind the scenes
will record all of that data

00:26:36.316 --> 00:26:39.006 A:middle
for you so when the user raises
the wrist and you get a chance

00:26:39.006 --> 00:26:40.916 A:middle
to run again, you update

00:26:40.916 --> 00:26:43.876 A:middle
on the data recorded while
your app was suspended.

00:26:45.076 --> 00:26:48.756 A:middle
This provides a really great
way to gather all this data

00:26:49.296 --> 00:26:50.066 A:middle
in the most power

00:26:50.066 --> 00:26:51.656 A:middle
and performance efficient
way possible

00:26:51.956 --> 00:26:54.476 A:middle
and provide great
experience to your users.

00:26:56.616 --> 00:26:59.396 A:middle
So there is also a whole session
on What's New in HealthKit,

00:26:59.846 --> 00:27:01.936 A:middle
definitely check that out
if you're writing work



00:26:59.846 --> 00:27:01.936 A:middle
definitely check that out
if you're writing work

00:27:01.936 --> 00:27:04.236 A:middle
out style apps or anything
that may take advantage

00:27:04.336 --> 00:27:06.836 A:middle
of the HealthKit data.

00:27:07.016 --> 00:27:08.456 A:middle
I also want to take
time and talk

00:27:08.456 --> 00:27:09.596 A:middle
about the security framework,

00:27:09.596 --> 00:27:12.386 A:middle
which maybe is not the most
exciting way to spend time.

00:27:13.076 --> 00:27:14.746 A:middle
Trust me, there is
important stuff here.

00:27:15.106 --> 00:27:20.506 A:middle
If you've used the security
framework on iOS you know

00:27:20.506 --> 00:27:23.156 A:middle
that this provides you with
access to the Keychain.

00:27:23.606 --> 00:27:26.586 A:middle
The Keychain on Apple
Watch is really interesting

00:27:27.016 --> 00:27:29.466 A:middle
because the unique thing
about Apple Watch is

00:27:29.466 --> 00:27:32.666 A:middle
that while it stays on your
user's wrist it remains unlocked

00:27:33.216 --> 00:27:36.336 A:middle
and as soon as the user
removes their watch the device

00:27:36.336 --> 00:27:37.326 A:middle
immediately locks.

00:27:38.476 --> 00:27:41.526 A:middle
You can take advantage of this
by storing your credentials

00:27:41.526 --> 00:27:45.026 A:middle
and secured data
in the Keychain.

00:27:46.486 --> 00:27:49.126 A:middle
By doing that, you ensure that
as long as the watch remains

00:27:49.126 --> 00:27:52.756 A:middle
on the user's wrist you have
access to the data and as soon

00:27:52.756 --> 00:27:55.716 A:middle
as it is removed the
data becomes inaccessible

00:27:55.716 --> 00:27:58.036 A:middle
because the watch is
locked [applause].

00:27:58.426 --> 00:28:06.926 A:middle
Thanks. He was very excited
about that [laughter]!



00:27:58.426 --> 00:28:06.926 A:middle
Thanks. He was very excited
about that [laughter]!

00:28:08.056 --> 00:28:08.906 A:middle
All right.

00:28:09.046 --> 00:28:09.896 A:middle
That's security.

00:28:11.366 --> 00:28:12.266 A:middle
Next up is MapKit.

00:28:12.556 --> 00:28:16.986 A:middle
There is a subset of the
MapKit API available as part

00:28:17.056 --> 00:28:20.926 A:middle
of the watchOS STK and in
particular the MK Map API.

00:28:21.896 --> 00:28:22.946 A:middle
The cool thing about this,

00:28:22.946 --> 00:28:27.226 A:middle
from your application you hand
a location over to the maps app

00:28:27.266 --> 00:28:30.096 A:middle
to send the user to go view it
in the full maps application.

00:28:30.696 --> 00:28:34.486 A:middle
Not only can they view it,
you can start directions

00:28:34.486 --> 00:28:36.646 A:middle
and routing from the app.

00:28:36.646 --> 00:28:39.056 A:middle
If you have a location and
want to have the user be able

00:28:39.056 --> 00:28:40.566 A:middle
to start getting
directions right to it,

00:28:40.896 --> 00:28:43.496 A:middle
you use the MapKit API
to begin the directions

00:28:43.496 --> 00:28:46.216 A:middle
on the Apple Watch and the
iPhone and send the user

00:28:46.216 --> 00:28:48.826 A:middle
over to get the directions
from the app.

00:28:50.076 --> 00:28:53.016 A:middle
There is also a session in
MapKit, What's New in MapKit

00:28:53.016 --> 00:28:54.706 A:middle
to learn all about that.

00:28:55.656 --> 00:28:58.116 A:middle
The last two frameworks
I want to talk about,

00:28:58.116 --> 00:29:01.676 A:middle
they're all about getting access
to your data on Apple Watch --



00:28:58.116 --> 00:29:01.676 A:middle
they're all about getting access
to your data on Apple Watch --

00:29:02.146 --> 00:29:05.456 A:middle
your user's data on Apple
Watch for types of data

00:29:05.456 --> 00:29:07.026 A:middle
that we've already
synchronized over.

00:29:08.616 --> 00:29:10.466 A:middle
The first one is the
contacts framework.

00:29:11.396 --> 00:29:14.306 A:middle
Contacts is a brand-new
framework in iOS 9

00:29:14.306 --> 00:29:18.026 A:middle
and watchOS 2 giving you
access to the address book

00:29:18.176 --> 00:29:22.396 A:middle
on Apple Watch and it has been
synchronized because we use it

00:29:22.396 --> 00:29:25.296 A:middle
in our own applications and you
have access to the local data

00:29:25.296 --> 00:29:26.736 A:middle
without having to transfer it.

00:29:26.736 --> 00:29:29.856 A:middle
There is a session on
the brand new framework,

00:29:30.246 --> 00:29:33.046 A:middle
Introducing Contacts
Framework for iOS and OS 10,

00:29:33.356 --> 00:29:34.826 A:middle
so you should definitely
check that out if you're going

00:29:34.826 --> 00:29:36.126 A:middle
to be using contact information.

00:29:36.866 --> 00:29:40.216 A:middle
Just like with core
location, the authorization

00:29:40.216 --> 00:29:42.376 A:middle
to access the user's
address book is shared

00:29:42.376 --> 00:29:44.716 A:middle
between the iOS app
and the watchOS app.

00:29:45.386 --> 00:29:48.616 A:middle
Since the user authorized you to
get access to the address book

00:29:48.616 --> 00:29:50.966 A:middle
on either sides you have
authorization on both

00:29:51.426 --> 00:29:53.716 A:middle
and there is one place
to manage authorization

00:29:54.066 --> 00:29:56.456 A:middle
on both Apple Watch and iPhone.

00:29:57.436 --> 00:30:00.836 A:middle
The final is EventKit.



00:29:57.436 --> 00:30:00.836 A:middle
The final is EventKit.

00:30:01.186 --> 00:30:03.646 A:middle
EventKit is how you get
access to the user's calendar.

00:30:04.656 --> 00:30:07.286 A:middle
This has the same set of story

00:30:07.286 --> 00:30:08.526 A:middle
as we talked about
with contacts.

00:30:09.116 --> 00:30:10.906 A:middle
Once you have gotten
authorization to access it,

00:30:10.906 --> 00:30:14.226 A:middle
it is the same on both your
iPhone app and the watch app.

00:30:16.496 --> 00:30:20.456 A:middle
So there is a ton of
stuff in watchOS 2.

00:30:21.716 --> 00:30:23.116 A:middle
Three brand-new frameworks --

00:30:23.946 --> 00:30:27.496 A:middle
well, three watch-specific
frameworks, WatchKit,

00:30:27.836 --> 00:30:32.106 A:middle
watch connectivity --
oh -- and Clock Kit.

00:30:34.576 --> 00:30:35.496 A:middle
Thank you.

00:30:36.016 --> 00:30:38.016 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:30:38.016 --> 00:30:43.000 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:43.046 --> 00:30:45.206 A:middle
Three brand-new frameworks
that are specific to watchOS

00:30:45.956 --> 00:30:48.916 A:middle
and there is a ton of new
functionality available in all

00:30:48.916 --> 00:30:52.746 A:middle
of the other frameworks
that are specific to watchOS

00:30:52.746 --> 00:30:54.646 A:middle
and some are shared
across all your apps.

00:30:55.766 --> 00:30:57.956 A:middle
There is a lot of
stuff when you learn it

00:30:57.956 --> 00:31:00.976 A:middle
on one platform you apply it
to all of the apps running



00:30:57.956 --> 00:31:00.976 A:middle
on one platform you apply it
to all of the apps running

00:31:00.976 --> 00:31:03.996 A:middle
on all platforms and other
frameworks to take advantage

00:31:03.996 --> 00:31:05.486 A:middle
of the watch-specific
functionality.

00:31:06.486 --> 00:31:08.166 A:middle
There is a ton of sessions
throughout the week

00:31:08.166 --> 00:31:09.966 A:middle
and other places to
learn more stuff.

00:31:10.706 --> 00:31:12.886 A:middle
In the documentation we
have a transition guide,

00:31:12.946 --> 00:31:17.176 A:middle
