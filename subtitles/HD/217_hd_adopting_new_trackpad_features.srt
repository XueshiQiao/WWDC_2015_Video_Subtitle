00:00:20.376 --> 00:00:21.456 A:middle
&gt;&gt; RALEIGH LEDET: Good morning.

00:00:25.036 --> 00:00:27.996 A:middle
Welcome to Session 217:
Adopting New Trackpad Features.

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:31.656 A:middle
My name is Raleigh Ledet, I'm an
AppKit engineer and I'm master

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:33.526 A:middle
of using the new
Force Touch trackpads,

00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:37.116 A:middle
so this is what we're
going to be talking about,

00:00:37.116 --> 00:00:38.456 A:middle
the new Force Touch trackpads.

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:42.306 A:middle
They're very, very cool
pieces of technology.

00:00:42.406 --> 00:00:45.236 A:middle
What makes them different
than our previous trackpads is

00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:48.176 A:middle
that there isn't a physical
button for you to press on.

00:00:48.706 --> 00:00:51.206 A:middle
Instead, we have these
four force sensors

00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:54.006 A:middle
so we can measure how much
force the user is applying

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:55.896 A:middle
to the trackpad and
then we marry

00:00:55.896 --> 00:00:57.516 A:middle
that with our Taptic Engine.

00:00:57.986 --> 00:00:58.826 A:middle
And when we've determined

00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:01.366 A:middle
that the user has pressed
enough force on the trackpad



00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:01.366 A:middle
that the user has pressed
enough force on the trackpad

00:01:01.446 --> 00:01:04.995 A:middle
to issue a mouse down, we go
ahead and use the Taptic Engine

00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:07.796 A:middle
and we yank the trackpad
sideways just a little bit,

00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:10.366 A:middle
and the user gets the feeling

00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.676 A:middle
that they have actually
pressed down on a button.

00:01:13.176 --> 00:01:14.936 A:middle
And so, the trackpad
moves sideways,

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:17.036 A:middle
but your brain makes you think

00:01:17.036 --> 00:01:18.566 A:middle
that you have actually
pressed down on a button.

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:21.346 A:middle
It's a really awesome
sensation and it's really neat

00:01:21.346 --> 00:01:23.346 A:middle
on how your mind is tricked

00:01:23.346 --> 00:01:24.516 A:middle
into believing you've
pressed a button.

00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:26.516 A:middle
We have some of these
downstairs in the lab,

00:01:26.516 --> 00:01:28.156 A:middle
if you haven't experienced
one of these yet,

00:01:28.576 --> 00:01:29.746 A:middle
please come down and try it out.

00:01:30.606 --> 00:01:33.466 A:middle
Another quick look at the
Taptic Engine going there --

00:01:34.356 --> 00:01:34.926 A:middle
pretty awesome.

00:01:35.396 --> 00:01:38.336 A:middle
So, to recap, you get a
little bit of pressure

00:01:38.336 --> 00:01:41.546 A:middle
and you get a click, but
allows us to recognize

00:01:41.616 --> 00:01:45.626 A:middle
when you apply more pressure to
the trackpad and we can sense

00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:47.226 A:middle
that as what we call
a Force click,

00:01:47.226 --> 00:01:48.856 A:middle
and you'll get a little
bit more haptic feedback

00:01:48.856 --> 00:01:49.636 A:middle
from that as well.

00:01:51.026 --> 00:01:52.096 A:middle
So, you can do lots

00:01:52.096 --> 00:01:53.636 A:middle
of interesting things
with the Force click.

00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:54.816 A:middle
In fact, let me show you some

00:01:54.816 --> 00:01:57.466 A:middle
of the interesting things
you can do with that now.

00:01:57.536 --> 00:02:06.006 A:middle
I have up here, you can see as
I'm moving the cursor around,



00:01:57.536 --> 00:02:06.006 A:middle
I have up here, you can see as
I'm moving the cursor around,

00:02:06.396 --> 00:02:09.395 A:middle
you can see the force that
I'm applying to the trackpad.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:12.806 A:middle
If I go down to the next level,
you get down to Force click.

00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:14.406 A:middle
And so, everybody was
able to hear that?

00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:16.936 A:middle
I've added -- you know, normally
your computer doesn't play a

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:18.916 A:middle
sound when you do Force
click; I've added that in

00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:21.136 A:middle
because you can't actually feel
the haptic feedback since you're

00:02:21.136 --> 00:02:22.246 A:middle
over there and I'm over here.

00:02:22.906 --> 00:02:27.226 A:middle
So, you'll be able to watch
as I do this demo the force

00:02:27.226 --> 00:02:28.406 A:middle
that I'm applying
to the trackpad.

00:02:29.136 --> 00:02:31.956 A:middle
One of the things that you
can do is renaming files

00:02:31.956 --> 00:02:33.696 A:middle
in the Finder; sometimes
it's kind of tricky,

00:02:33.696 --> 00:02:37.266 A:middle
you have to click on it, and
you have to do it a second time

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:39.356 A:middle
in such a way that --
and I missed it again.

00:02:39.356 --> 00:02:40.366 A:middle
You got to do the right timing

00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:41.706 A:middle
so you don't double-click
and open it.

00:02:42.186 --> 00:02:45.756 A:middle
But with the Force Touch,
you just Force click on it,

00:02:45.756 --> 00:02:48.296 A:middle
it goes right immediately
into editing the filename.

00:02:48.486 --> 00:02:51.346 A:middle
It's a lot easier to do; that's
just one of the small things

00:02:51.346 --> 00:02:52.566 A:middle
that you can do with
Force click.

00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:54.616 A:middle
I'm going to open up
TextEdit real quick.

00:02:55.256 --> 00:02:59.646 A:middle
Let me grab the window.



00:03:00.356 --> 00:03:03.366 A:middle
You have seen this example
as well, you can Force click

00:03:03.496 --> 00:03:05.736 A:middle
and you can get Quick
Look to come up.

00:03:05.736 --> 00:03:08.306 A:middle
It's kind of neat, you can
actually sit here, you can play

00:03:08.306 --> 00:03:12.506 A:middle
around with the animation if
you adjust your force levels.

00:03:12.656 --> 00:03:15.536 A:middle
That's another feature
that we have.

00:03:15.576 --> 00:03:18.136 A:middle
Lastly to show you some
things real quick, you know,

00:03:18.136 --> 00:03:20.756 A:middle
I could change how fast
by varying the force,

00:03:20.756 --> 00:03:24.886 A:middle
how fast the photos come
in, or changing the amount

00:03:25.096 --> 00:03:27.416 A:middle
that the indicator is showing,

00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:29.096 A:middle
you can control the
amount of pressure here.

00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:31.686 A:middle
And of course, no pressure
demo would be complete

00:03:31.686 --> 00:03:34.776 A:middle
without having a drawing field
that you can draw on as well.

00:03:35.566 --> 00:03:38.526 A:middle
Lastly, don't have the
sound hooked up for this,

00:03:38.526 --> 00:03:40.806 A:middle
but on this control
when it gets --

00:03:40.926 --> 00:03:42.336 A:middle
when you rotate the
photo back to zero,

00:03:42.336 --> 00:03:43.956 A:middle
you're feeling a little
bit of haptic feedback

00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:45.446 A:middle
on the trackpad for that.

00:03:45.876 --> 00:03:47.696 A:middle
So that's pretty neat.

00:03:48.176 --> 00:03:49.426 A:middle
Let's switch back to the slides.

00:03:50.566 --> 00:03:51.756 A:middle
We've got a lot to cover.

00:03:52.296 --> 00:03:53.506 A:middle
We're going to talk
about the APIs,

00:03:53.506 --> 00:03:57.036 A:middle
that that application was using,
the various APIs that we use

00:03:57.036 --> 00:03:59.116 A:middle
in the system as well,
so that you can go ahead

00:03:59.116 --> 00:04:00.426 A:middle
and add all sorts



00:03:59.116 --> 00:04:00.426 A:middle
and add all sorts

00:04:00.556 --> 00:04:04.266 A:middle
of new features using
the Force Touch trackpad

00:04:04.266 --> 00:04:05.076 A:middle
in your application.

00:04:05.656 --> 00:04:08.366 A:middle
I'm going to teach you today how

00:04:08.366 --> 00:04:11.276 A:middle
to become a master using the
Force Touch trackpad on OS X.

00:04:11.866 --> 00:04:13.626 A:middle
To become a master in
the Force Touch trackpad,

00:04:13.626 --> 00:04:14.986 A:middle
even though we're going
to do it in one day,

00:04:15.026 --> 00:04:15.976 A:middle
you've got to start off small,

00:04:15.976 --> 00:04:17.156 A:middle
you've got to start
off learning everything

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:20.106 A:middle
that a squire would know about
using the Force Touch trackpad,

00:04:20.106 --> 00:04:22.716 A:middle
and this is all about
using the high-level APIs

00:04:23.036 --> 00:04:26.756 A:middle
and the built-in tools that we
have in some of our controls.

00:04:27.296 --> 00:04:28.506 A:middle
The we're going to move
on, and we're going

00:04:28.566 --> 00:04:30.046 A:middle
to learn everything a
knight needs to know

00:04:30.046 --> 00:04:31.546 A:middle
about using the Force
Touch trackpad.

00:04:31.906 --> 00:04:34.896 A:middle
This is all about the flow of
the force through the system,

00:04:34.896 --> 00:04:37.276 A:middle
the event stream, we'll talk
about customizing Spring Loading

00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:39.726 A:middle
in your application and
then taking it all the way

00:04:39.726 --> 00:04:41.146 A:middle
to doing some Alignment Feedback

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:43.426 A:middle
and providing some additional
haptic feedback to the user.

00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:47.146 A:middle
Then finally, we're going to cap
it off with becoming a master

00:04:47.146 --> 00:04:49.086 A:middle
of using the Force Touch
trackpad and this is

00:04:49.086 --> 00:04:50.386 A:middle
about controlling the force.

00:04:50.516 --> 00:04:52.066 A:middle
Configuring the trackpad

00:04:52.366 --> 00:04:54.876 A:middle
so it is doing the
appropriate haptic feedbacks

00:04:54.876 --> 00:04:57.516 A:middle
for the given situation
for your controls

00:04:57.946 --> 00:05:00.246 A:middle
and manually playing haptic
feedbacks where appropriate.



00:04:57.946 --> 00:05:00.246 A:middle
and manually playing haptic
feedbacks where appropriate.

00:05:01.056 --> 00:05:03.056 A:middle
So let's dig in.

00:05:05.216 --> 00:05:08.466 A:middle
In being a squire we're going
to talk about Table Row Actions,

00:05:08.466 --> 00:05:10.066 A:middle
it's a nice, neat new
feature, you have seen

00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:12.206 A:middle
that in the Mail
application demo

00:05:12.206 --> 00:05:13.376 A:middle
that Craig did during
the keynote.

00:05:13.806 --> 00:05:15.176 A:middle
We'll talk about
spring-loaded controls,

00:05:15.256 --> 00:05:18.246 A:middle
some things that are built in,
and the accelerator controls.

00:05:18.316 --> 00:05:20.396 A:middle
We're going to do that by
looking at some case studies.

00:05:21.026 --> 00:05:24.186 A:middle
Here is Mail, for example, and
if you do a two-finger swipe

00:05:24.186 --> 00:05:27.246 A:middle
on a row in Mail, you get
some more Table Row Actions

00:05:27.246 --> 00:05:28.776 A:middle
that could come up, and
you can click on them,

00:05:28.886 --> 00:05:31.736 A:middle
or you can do a smooth swipe,
a little bit longer swipe

00:05:31.736 --> 00:05:35.166 A:middle
and it will actually
activate the default action

00:05:35.266 --> 00:05:37.156 A:middle
and so it is one complete
gesture for the user.

00:05:37.526 --> 00:05:39.476 A:middle
It is a really nice way

00:05:39.576 --> 00:05:41.316 A:middle
of adding some additional
functionality

00:05:41.316 --> 00:05:42.076 A:middle
to your application.

00:05:42.076 --> 00:05:43.686 A:middle
I use it every day
in Mail myself.

00:05:44.226 --> 00:05:45.926 A:middle
The API for it is
incredibly simple.

00:05:46.296 --> 00:05:47.496 A:middle
In your tableView delegate,

00:05:47.496 --> 00:05:49.906 A:middle
just implement tableView
rowActionsForRow edge,

00:05:50.306 --> 00:05:52.496 A:middle
and we will tell you what edge
it is, it's either the leading

00:05:52.496 --> 00:05:54.196 A:middle
or the trailing, so we
handle right to left

00:05:54.196 --> 00:05:55.186 A:middle
and left to right for you.

00:05:56.516 --> 00:06:00.736 A:middle
And then you just return back
an array of Table Row Actions.



00:05:56.516 --> 00:06:00.736 A:middle
And then you just return back
an array of Table Row Actions.

00:06:00.736 --> 00:06:05.066 A:middle
Create a new NSTable Row Action,
you init with a style, a title,

00:06:05.066 --> 00:06:08.446 A:middle
and a handler, the handler's
what's going to get called back

00:06:08.446 --> 00:06:11.166 A:middle
if that item is selected,
either by clicking on it

00:06:11.166 --> 00:06:13.206 A:middle
or if they did a complete
swipe for the default one,

00:06:13.586 --> 00:06:17.216 A:middle
it goes ahead and the
handler is called.

00:06:17.346 --> 00:06:20.076 A:middle
We have a couple of styles:
Regular and Destructive.

00:06:20.876 --> 00:06:22.956 A:middle
Regular is the one with
the blue highlighting,

00:06:22.956 --> 00:06:25.616 A:middle
and that's what you
should use for most styles

00:06:25.616 --> 00:06:27.206 A:middle
of your Table Row Actions.

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:29.226 A:middle
Destructive is the
one that's red.

00:06:29.946 --> 00:06:31.836 A:middle
Don't choose these
because of their color;

00:06:31.956 --> 00:06:33.366 A:middle
it is more than just red.

00:06:33.686 --> 00:06:38.786 A:middle
The destructive items, since by
nature they're destructive we

00:06:38.786 --> 00:06:39.936 A:middle
actually make it a
little bit harder

00:06:39.936 --> 00:06:41.506 A:middle
for the user to do a full swipe.

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:44.006 A:middle
They have to swipe
a further distance

00:06:44.276 --> 00:06:47.616 A:middle
on the trackpad before a
destructive action is triggered

00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:48.166 A:middle
by default.

00:06:48.636 --> 00:06:51.966 A:middle
This is so that they don't
accidentally trigger it.

00:06:51.966 --> 00:06:54.256 A:middle
Use regular for almost
everything

00:06:54.256 --> 00:06:57.326 A:middle
and reserve destructive items
just for destructive, don't try

00:06:57.326 --> 00:07:00.746 A:middle
and get the red color, there is
some important semantics there



00:06:57.326 --> 00:07:00.746 A:middle
and get the red color, there is
some important semantics there

00:07:00.746 --> 00:07:01.606 A:middle
that you need to be aware of.

00:07:02.136 --> 00:07:04.586 A:middle
And that's all there
is to this API.

00:07:04.836 --> 00:07:05.586 A:middle
It's that simple.

00:07:05.796 --> 00:07:08.856 A:middle
This works on a new Force Touch
trackpad and it also works

00:07:08.856 --> 00:07:10.956 A:middle
on our legacy trackpads
and the Magic Mouse,

00:07:11.256 --> 00:07:13.306 A:middle
so you can easily add
these to your application

00:07:13.606 --> 00:07:16.056 A:middle
and you can open up some
great new possibilities.

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:19.806 A:middle
Let's look at Spring
Loading in the Finder.

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:23.736 A:middle
So I have this image of
Lola that I downloaded,

00:07:23.736 --> 00:07:25.806 A:middle
and I want to move her
to my Documents folder.

00:07:25.806 --> 00:07:28.416 A:middle
Some I'm going to start dragging
and go back in my history

00:07:28.416 --> 00:07:31.106 A:middle
by Force clicking, I'm even
going to change it to icon mode

00:07:31.106 --> 00:07:32.766 A:middle
so I can find the
Documents folder easier,

00:07:33.026 --> 00:07:35.176 A:middle
and then finally go ahead and
drop it in my Documents folder.

00:07:35.916 --> 00:07:38.026 A:middle
You might have known about
spring loading before

00:07:38.376 --> 00:07:40.626 A:middle
where you could hover over a
folder and after a timeout,

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:43.326 A:middle
the folder would go
ahead and spring load.

00:07:43.656 --> 00:07:45.376 A:middle
We have added spring
loading to a lot more places

00:07:45.376 --> 00:07:47.096 A:middle
and applications to
bring windows forwards,

00:07:47.516 --> 00:07:49.436 A:middle
and as you saw the
buttons were spring loaded,

00:07:49.666 --> 00:07:52.386 A:middle
and you can bypass
the hover timeout

00:07:52.386 --> 00:07:53.556 A:middle
by just doing a Force click,

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:58.606 A:middle
and it becomes much more
intuitive and easier to use.

00:07:59.336 --> 00:08:02.146 A:middle
To implement Spring Loading



00:07:59.336 --> 00:08:02.146 A:middle
To implement Spring Loading

00:08:02.146 --> 00:08:05.706 A:middle
in those toolbar buttons all
Finder did was set the Spring

00:08:05.706 --> 00:08:08.746 A:middle
Loading property of
NSButton to true.

00:08:09.176 --> 00:08:10.806 A:middle
Really what they did was
just check the box in IB.

00:08:10.806 --> 00:08:11.546 A:middle
It is that easy.

00:08:11.546 --> 00:08:13.966 A:middle
You can do that for
segmented control as well;

00:08:13.966 --> 00:08:17.616 A:middle
when I change the icon layout
from list view to icon view,

00:08:18.106 --> 00:08:19.616 A:middle
that's on NSSegmentedControl,

00:08:19.616 --> 00:08:21.216 A:middle
and again it's just a
springLoaded property

00:08:21.776 --> 00:08:24.016 A:middle
and you can set it
with a check box in IB.

00:08:24.016 --> 00:08:27.126 A:middle
It's that simple to turn Spring
Loading on in your buttons

00:08:27.396 --> 00:08:28.396 A:middle
and your segmented controls.

00:08:28.656 --> 00:08:31.146 A:middle
You have to opt in for
this, but for places

00:08:31.146 --> 00:08:33.155 A:middle
that are doing navigation
during drag

00:08:33.155 --> 00:08:35.006 A:middle
and drop it is really
useful and I suggest

00:08:35.006 --> 00:08:35.916 A:middle
that you go and turn it on.

00:08:37.376 --> 00:08:40.405 A:middle
There is another example of
using force; this is QuickTime.

00:08:40.405 --> 00:08:42.866 A:middle
I want you to pay attention to
the fast-forward button here.

00:08:42.916 --> 00:08:46.736 A:middle
I'm going to use the Force
Touch trackpad and I'm going

00:08:46.736 --> 00:08:48.176 A:middle
to apply different
pressure to the button,

00:08:48.176 --> 00:08:50.496 A:middle
and you can see I can
go up to 5x, 10x, 30x.

00:08:50.766 --> 00:08:51.596 A:middle
You can back off.

00:08:51.986 --> 00:08:53.736 A:middle
As you're moving
through your movie file,

00:08:54.056 --> 00:08:56.036 A:middle
you can control how fast
you're moving forward,

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:58.196 A:middle
so you slow down when you
get close to that area

00:08:58.196 --> 00:09:00.036 A:middle
that you're looking for
without overshooting.



00:08:58.196 --> 00:09:00.036 A:middle
that you're looking for
without overshooting.

00:09:00.596 --> 00:09:04.906 A:middle
The way QuickTime does this
is we have a new button type,

00:09:04.906 --> 00:09:08.876 A:middle
so the fast-forward buttons are
really literally just NSButtons

00:09:08.876 --> 00:09:11.516 A:middle
with a custom image, and
they set the button type

00:09:11.746 --> 00:09:14.586 A:middle
to either AcceleratorButton or
MultiLevelAcceleratorButton.

00:09:15.526 --> 00:09:18.586 A:middle
For AcceleratorButton -- you
can set it right here in IB --

00:09:19.136 --> 00:09:23.086 A:middle
as the force in the
trackpad changes,

00:09:23.356 --> 00:09:25.436 A:middle
the button will continually
send its action message,

00:09:25.546 --> 00:09:27.606 A:middle
so as the force changes, you
get a new action message;

00:09:27.796 --> 00:09:29.686 A:middle
when the force changes again,
you get a new action message,

00:09:30.256 --> 00:09:33.086 A:middle
and the range of the
doubleValue is going to be 1

00:09:33.086 --> 00:09:35.676 A:middle
when the user clicks
the button up to 2

00:09:35.676 --> 00:09:39.236 A:middle
as the user presses the
maximum amount of force

00:09:39.236 --> 00:09:41.686 A:middle
on the trackpad that we accept.

00:09:42.856 --> 00:09:45.626 A:middle
You can see the pressure
change between 1 and 2

00:09:45.626 --> 00:09:48.356 A:middle
and you can adjust
however you --

00:09:48.356 --> 00:09:49.736 A:middle
whatever you need
to do with that.

00:09:49.736 --> 00:09:52.956 A:middle
In QuickTime's case, that
controls the acceleration.

00:09:54.036 --> 00:09:55.786 A:middle
You will finally
get a value of 0.

00:09:55.786 --> 00:09:58.116 A:middle
A final action message
with a value of 0

00:09:58.116 --> 00:10:00.326 A:middle
when the user ends
tracking of the button.



00:09:58.116 --> 00:10:00.326 A:middle
when the user ends
tracking of the button.

00:10:00.626 --> 00:10:01.936 A:middle
When they release
the mouse button up,

00:10:02.386 --> 00:10:04.486 A:middle
you'll get a last action
message with a range of zero.

00:10:05.506 --> 00:10:07.506 A:middle
Now, what QuickTime is
actually using here is the

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:09.396 A:middle
MultiLevelAcceleratorButton.

00:10:09.986 --> 00:10:11.706 A:middle
You can set that
right here in IB.

00:10:12.326 --> 00:10:15.606 A:middle
The MultiLevelAcceleratorButton
is discrete;

00:10:15.976 --> 00:10:19.816 A:middle
whereas the AcceleratorButton
is a smooth range,

00:10:19.816 --> 00:10:21.466 A:middle
a continuous range
between 1 and 2,

00:10:21.616 --> 00:10:24.326 A:middle
the AcceleratorButton
is integer levels,

00:10:24.366 --> 00:10:26.386 A:middle
it's a discrete integer
levels, and you can set

00:10:26.386 --> 00:10:29.186 A:middle
that with the
maxAcceleratorLevel.

00:10:29.766 --> 00:10:33.246 A:middle
Our range is between 1 and 5
so you can set how many levels

00:10:33.246 --> 00:10:35.156 A:middle
that you want to have
in your acceleration;

00:10:35.956 --> 00:10:37.696 A:middle
by default it is 2.

00:10:38.266 --> 00:10:39.506 A:middle
QuickTime sets it to 5.

00:10:40.286 --> 00:10:42.256 A:middle
Then again, you look
at the doubleValue.

00:10:42.296 --> 00:10:45.286 A:middle
Now the range is going to be
0 to 5, it's 1 when you click,

00:10:45.286 --> 00:10:46.796 A:middle
as the user goes up
through the levels,

00:10:46.796 --> 00:10:48.976 A:middle
it'll go up to whatever
you set the max level to,

00:10:49.356 --> 00:10:51.716 A:middle
and you'll get a final
message action of 0

00:10:51.716 --> 00:10:53.286 A:middle
when the user finishes tracking.

00:10:53.526 --> 00:10:54.846 A:middle
And this is what
QuickTime is doing.

00:10:55.116 --> 00:10:58.626 A:middle
Here you can see how QuickTime
is just mapping 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:10:58.626 --> 00:11:00.316 A:middle
and 5 to your various speeds,



00:10:58.626 --> 00:11:00.316 A:middle
and 5 to your various speeds,

00:11:00.516 --> 00:11:03.466 A:middle
and for example 3 is
10x fast-forwarding.

00:11:03.906 --> 00:11:08.766 A:middle
Another example of Accelerator
Controls: here is Maps,

00:11:09.446 --> 00:11:11.176 A:middle
and Maps has this
nice zoom buttons,

00:11:11.976 --> 00:11:14.636 A:middle
and these are actually
implemented

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:16.686 A:middle
as NSSegmentedControls.

00:11:17.146 --> 00:11:19.256 A:middle
NSSegmentedControls
has a new tracking mode

00:11:19.256 --> 00:11:23.206 A:middle
which is MomentaryAccelerator,
and this works exactly

00:11:23.206 --> 00:11:26.666 A:middle
like the accelerator
NSButtonType does --

00:11:27.386 --> 00:11:29.166 A:middle
real easy to set
that in IB as well.

00:11:29.166 --> 00:11:31.766 A:middle
But instead of asking
for the doubleValue

00:11:31.766 --> 00:11:34.586 A:middle
when the segmented control
action messages are fired,

00:11:34.756 --> 00:11:36.016 A:middle
you want to ask for
the doubleValue

00:11:36.016 --> 00:11:37.246 A:middle
for the selected segment.

00:11:37.686 --> 00:11:40.406 A:middle
It is the same range as
we discussed earlier;

00:11:40.406 --> 00:11:44.006 A:middle
it's 1 to 2 with a final action
message with a value of 0

00:11:44.006 --> 00:11:44.996 A:middle
when tracking has ended.

00:11:46.446 --> 00:11:49.206 A:middle
Segmented controls don't
have a multilevel option,

00:11:49.436 --> 00:11:51.926 A:middle
they only support
the continuous mode.

00:11:52.456 --> 00:11:56.356 A:middle
Here is an example of Photos.

00:11:57.176 --> 00:12:02.386 A:middle
For moving through your
photos in Photos by applying,



00:11:57.176 --> 00:12:02.386 A:middle
For moving through your
photos in Photos by applying,

00:12:03.096 --> 00:12:04.326 A:middle
varying the pressure,

00:12:04.326 --> 00:12:07.026 A:middle
I can control how fast
the photos move across.

00:12:07.796 --> 00:12:10.906 A:middle
This is something that we call a
continuous accelerator control.

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:14.006 A:middle
If you have an accelerator
control settings

00:12:14.006 --> 00:12:16.206 A:middle
on either NSButton or
NSSegmentedControl,

00:12:16.546 --> 00:12:20.136 A:middle
in the NSControl section you can
set the continuous flag to true

00:12:20.356 --> 00:12:22.036 A:middle
or just check the box in IB,

00:12:22.766 --> 00:12:26.396 A:middle
and you'll get what we call a
continuous accelerator control.

00:12:27.186 --> 00:12:29.176 A:middle
Continuous accelerator
controls are different

00:12:29.176 --> 00:12:31.916 A:middle
because you don't worry about
their doubleValues so much.

00:12:31.916 --> 00:12:33.996 A:middle
You just want to move to
the next slide as soon

00:12:33.996 --> 00:12:34.906 A:middle
as the action happens.

00:12:34.956 --> 00:12:37.086 A:middle
The doubleValue doesn't matter.

00:12:37.086 --> 00:12:39.196 A:middle
They come back, come
in on a heartbeat,

00:12:39.376 --> 00:12:41.646 A:middle
and the force changes the
frequency of that heartbeat.

00:12:42.036 --> 00:12:42.996 A:middle
That's the difference.

00:12:43.276 --> 00:12:46.416 A:middle
To drive the point home a little
bit, let's compare the two.

00:12:46.956 --> 00:12:48.056 A:middle
In accelerated control,

00:12:48.926 --> 00:12:51.656 A:middle
ou get your action message
whenever the pressure happens

00:12:51.696 --> 00:12:53.836 A:middle
to change, so there may be a
little bit of delay in there,

00:12:54.046 --> 00:12:56.046 A:middle
it may come close together,

00:12:56.256 --> 00:12:58.446 A:middle
and you just change how
fast you're fast-forwarding

00:12:58.446 --> 00:12:58.916 A:middle
in the movie.



00:13:00.296 --> 00:13:05.026 A:middle
For a continuous control
it comes in on a heartbeat

00:13:05.026 --> 00:13:06.246 A:middle
for a continuous acceleration,

00:13:06.246 --> 00:13:07.766 A:middle
and then you just
do your action.

00:13:07.936 --> 00:13:10.006 A:middle
The frequency, they might
come together closely

00:13:10.006 --> 00:13:12.616 A:middle
if the frequency is high because
the user is applying a lot

00:13:12.616 --> 00:13:12.996 A:middle
of force.

00:13:13.286 --> 00:13:16.826 A:middle
It is a great way for doing
something like sliding photos

00:13:16.826 --> 00:13:19.276 A:middle
where the animation speed is
constant, but when do you need

00:13:19.276 --> 00:13:20.516 A:middle
to bring in the next photo?

00:13:20.726 --> 00:13:22.436 A:middle
That's the next time
the action message fires

00:13:22.706 --> 00:13:24.186 A:middle
and it gives the user
a lot of control.

00:13:25.476 --> 00:13:27.456 A:middle
That's everything you need
to know to be a squire.

00:13:27.456 --> 00:13:28.196 A:middle
Congratulations.

00:13:28.196 --> 00:13:30.456 A:middle
You are all now squires in
using the Force Touch trackpads.

00:13:30.456 --> 00:13:33.586 A:middle
We have talked about Table
Row Actions, a very easy API

00:13:33.586 --> 00:13:36.026 A:middle
to implement, spring-loaded
NSButtons

00:13:36.026 --> 00:13:38.446 A:middle
and accelerator NS Buttons
and segmented controls,

00:13:38.576 --> 00:13:41.506 A:middle
they're real easy to turn
on, our high-level API,

00:13:41.616 --> 00:13:45.076 A:middle
you get a lot of bang for your
buck here in using these APIs

00:13:45.386 --> 00:13:47.326 A:middle
and we hope that you turn
them on in your applications.

00:13:48.416 --> 00:13:49.586 A:middle
Let's move forward
to being a knight.

00:13:50.516 --> 00:13:51.726 A:middle
Being a knight is all

00:13:51.726 --> 00:13:54.216 A:middle
about understanding how the
force flows through the system.

00:13:54.716 --> 00:13:56.576 A:middle
We're going to talk about
the force event stream,

00:13:56.576 --> 00:13:58.516 A:middle
and then I'm also going to talk

00:13:58.516 --> 00:14:01.156 A:middle
about the spring-loading
protocol



00:13:58.516 --> 00:14:01.156 A:middle
about the spring-loading
protocol

00:14:01.156 --> 00:14:04.766 A:middle
so that you can use the same
API that NSButton is doing

00:14:04.966 --> 00:14:07.376 A:middle
to provide spring loading
in your custom applications.

00:14:08.006 --> 00:14:11.506 A:middle
Then finally we will talk about
some Alignment Feedback API

00:14:11.506 --> 00:14:15.136 A:middle
to help you do snap-to
guides and things like that.

00:14:15.136 --> 00:14:17.376 A:middle
Let's talk about
the event stream.

00:14:18.296 --> 00:14:23.176 A:middle
We have a ton of events already
on OS X; you get the mouse downs

00:14:23.176 --> 00:14:26.226 A:middle
and ups, your gestures
for magnify and rotate.

00:14:26.496 --> 00:14:27.916 A:middle
And now we're introducing
another one:

00:14:27.996 --> 00:14:29.296 A:middle
NSEventTypePressure.

00:14:30.116 --> 00:14:32.576 A:middle
Or actually, we introduced
it in 10.10.3

00:14:32.576 --> 00:14:33.926 A:middle
when we introduced
the new MacBooks,

00:14:34.266 --> 00:14:37.706 A:middle
so you can get
NSEventTypePressures there

00:14:37.706 --> 00:14:38.086 A:middle
as well.

00:14:38.706 --> 00:14:40.066 A:middle
The are pressure gesture.

00:14:41.126 --> 00:14:42.866 A:middle
And along with the new
event type, of course,

00:14:42.866 --> 00:14:44.296 A:middle
we have the event
mask to go along

00:14:44.296 --> 00:14:46.506 A:middle
with it: NSEventMaskPressure.

00:14:46.856 --> 00:14:49.056 A:middle
And what this means is that
during your tracking loops,

00:14:49.596 --> 00:14:51.236 A:middle
you can just add
event mask pressure

00:14:51.236 --> 00:14:52.726 A:middle
to your tracking loop mask,

00:14:53.696 --> 00:14:56.796 A:middle
and you can get the
pressure events coming

00:14:56.796 --> 00:14:58.436 A:middle
in as you're tracking
the mouse as well.

00:14:59.176 --> 00:15:00.216 A:middle
It is really easy to use.



00:14:59.176 --> 00:15:00.216 A:middle
It is really easy to use.

00:15:01.686 --> 00:15:03.576 A:middle
If you prefer to use
the responder approach

00:15:03.576 --> 00:15:06.716 A:middle
where you're overriding
mouse down and mouse drag

00:15:06.716 --> 00:15:08.856 A:middle
and mouse up, we also have
a new responder method

00:15:08.896 --> 00:15:11.016 A:middle
pressureChangeWithEvent, so
you can get them that way

00:15:11.016 --> 00:15:11.836 A:middle
as well if you prefer.

00:15:12.366 --> 00:15:17.316 A:middle
Let's dig into the properties
of the pressure gesture.

00:15:17.636 --> 00:15:20.496 A:middle
It is a gesture; unlike
a mouse event sequence

00:15:20.496 --> 00:15:23.266 A:middle
which has individual types
for mouse down, mouse drag,

00:15:23.266 --> 00:15:26.606 A:middle
and mouse up, there is just
the single type for pressure,

00:15:26.946 --> 00:15:29.886 A:middle
it has a phase, and it goes
through a cycle of Began,

00:15:30.136 --> 00:15:32.076 A:middle
Changed, and Ended
when the gesture ends.

00:15:33.536 --> 00:15:34.686 A:middle
And we have a stage.

00:15:34.896 --> 00:15:37.226 A:middle
A stage is how we determine
when a Force click happens.

00:15:37.816 --> 00:15:43.416 A:middle
So when you do a mouse down with
a trackpad you'll get a Began

00:15:43.416 --> 00:15:46.406 A:middle
phase pressure gesture and
it will have a stage of 1.

00:15:46.406 --> 00:15:48.886 A:middle
This is the standard
click level stage.

00:15:48.946 --> 00:15:51.716 A:middle
The user presses harder to
get to Force click level

00:15:51.716 --> 00:15:53.746 A:middle
on the trackpad, the
stage will change to 2.

00:15:53.746 --> 00:15:56.386 A:middle
That's how you know the user's
accomplished Force click

00:15:56.806 --> 00:15:59.526 A:middle
and you can just immediately do
your Force click action and go

00:15:59.526 --> 00:16:01.716 A:middle
into rename on the
Finder, for example.



00:15:59.526 --> 00:16:01.716 A:middle
into rename on the
Finder, for example.

00:16:02.756 --> 00:16:05.316 A:middle
Then as the user releases
the force from the trackpad,

00:16:05.786 --> 00:16:08.116 A:middle
it goes back to stage 1
as it gets to click level,

00:16:08.116 --> 00:16:10.496 A:middle
and eventually it gets to
stage 0 when the gesture ends

00:16:10.906 --> 00:16:15.266 A:middle
because the mouse button
down, it is no longer down,

00:16:15.736 --> 00:16:19.906 A:middle
so you get a final event of
stage 0 with a phase of Ended.

00:16:20.486 --> 00:16:25.226 A:middle
Now, of course, no pressure
gesture would be complete

00:16:25.226 --> 00:16:26.676 A:middle
without actually
having a pressure value,

00:16:26.676 --> 00:16:28.376 A:middle
so we have a pressure
property as well,

00:16:28.376 --> 00:16:29.726 A:middle
it is within the
range of 0 to 1.

00:16:30.866 --> 00:16:32.216 A:middle
It is important to note here

00:16:32.216 --> 00:16:34.386 A:middle
that the pressure
property is the pressure

00:16:34.386 --> 00:16:35.476 A:middle
of the current stage.

00:16:35.476 --> 00:16:36.616 A:middle
So as you can see in the chart,

00:16:36.616 --> 00:16:39.566 A:middle
as you enter stage 1 the
pressure starts to go up

00:16:39.566 --> 00:16:43.066 A:middle
and reaches 1 as you approach
stage 2, and once you cross

00:16:43.066 --> 00:16:45.306 A:middle
over to stage 2, the pressure
drops immediately back

00:16:45.306 --> 00:16:47.576 A:middle
down to 0, and it
goes back up again

00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:51.466 A:middle
as you increase the pressure
while you're in stage 2.

00:16:51.526 --> 00:16:54.386 A:middle
The pressure is of
the current stage.

00:16:55.036 --> 00:16:55.756 A:middle
That's really important.

00:16:57.206 --> 00:16:59.966 A:middle
Now I'm showing a linear
mapping between the force



00:17:00.006 --> 00:17:03.416 A:middle
on the trackpad to what the
user is doing to the values

00:17:03.416 --> 00:17:05.516 A:middle
in the pressure event,
but I don't want you

00:17:05.516 --> 00:17:06.506 A:middle
to read too much into that.

00:17:07.175 --> 00:17:10.316 A:middle
We like to think of every
click on the trackpad

00:17:10.316 --> 00:17:13.066 A:middle
as a new adventure,
and we look at a lot

00:17:13.066 --> 00:17:15.836 A:middle
of different variables -- is
the user using their thumb,

00:17:15.836 --> 00:17:18.516 A:middle
what firmness setting do they
have in their preferences,

00:17:18.976 --> 00:17:20.935 A:middle
how are they interacting
with the trackpad --

00:17:20.935 --> 00:17:23.165 A:middle
so we dynamically change
these curves on the fly

00:17:23.165 --> 00:17:25.136 A:middle
to give the user the
best possible experience,

00:17:25.496 --> 00:17:28.296 A:middle
and we normalize the
input from the trackpad

00:17:28.696 --> 00:17:30.496 A:middle
into the pressure
range of 0 to 1

00:17:30.796 --> 00:17:32.436 A:middle
and that's what you should
be using in your application.

00:17:32.996 --> 00:17:37.226 A:middle
As you notice when I was
clicking around earlier

00:17:37.226 --> 00:17:39.836 A:middle
in the demo, just clicking
around in TextEdit,

00:17:40.386 --> 00:17:45.016 A:middle
I wasn't getting the animation
of the popover until I started

00:17:45.016 --> 00:17:46.906 A:middle
to really get close to
having enough pressure

00:17:46.906 --> 00:17:47.736 A:middle
to reach Force click.

00:17:47.736 --> 00:17:51.446 A:middle
You don't want to
have a whole bunch

00:17:51.446 --> 00:17:52.736 A:middle
of distracting animations
occurring

00:17:52.736 --> 00:17:54.176 A:middle
when the user's just
clicking around.

00:17:54.326 --> 00:17:57.906 A:middle
Doing this animation as they're
approaching the transition

00:17:57.906 --> 00:17:59.016 A:middle
to stage 2 can be useful.

00:17:59.336 --> 00:18:01.056 A:middle
This is what the stage
transition property is



00:17:59.336 --> 00:18:01.056 A:middle
This is what the stage
transition property is

00:18:01.056 --> 00:18:01.606 A:middle
useful for.

00:18:02.156 --> 00:18:04.356 A:middle
As you see here, it is in
the range of 0 to 1 just

00:18:04.356 --> 00:18:07.226 A:middle
like pressure, but it stays at 0
for a much longer period of time

00:18:07.226 --> 00:18:09.466 A:middle
until you start to
approach the next stage,

00:18:09.466 --> 00:18:10.506 A:middle
stage 2 in this case.

00:18:11.066 --> 00:18:13.996 A:middle
I want you to get to approach
stage 2, it will then shoot

00:18:13.996 --> 00:18:17.716 A:middle
up to 1, you can use this range
to control your animation,

00:18:18.016 --> 00:18:19.666 A:middle
and it won't interfere
with just clicking

00:18:19.666 --> 00:18:21.166 A:middle
around in your interface.

00:18:21.216 --> 00:18:23.656 A:middle
You can get that
animation and as soon

00:18:23.656 --> 00:18:26.076 A:middle
as you reach stage 2 you can pop
that animation to completion,

00:18:26.076 --> 00:18:29.526 A:middle
and you can see the
stageTransition value drops back

00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:32.426 A:middle
to 0 once you reach stage 2,
and we don't have a stage 3

00:18:32.426 --> 00:18:35.046 A:middle
in this case to transition
to, so it just stays at 0

00:18:35.046 --> 00:18:37.886 A:middle
for the remainder of the time.

00:18:38.086 --> 00:18:42.286 A:middle
I mentioned earlier that
mouse events are going

00:18:42.286 --> 00:18:45.386 A:middle
on at the same time as
pressure gestures are.

00:18:45.476 --> 00:18:47.756 A:middle
The trackpad is still emulating
a mouse like it always has.

00:18:48.686 --> 00:18:51.706 A:middle
It is also issuing
pressure gestures.

00:18:51.706 --> 00:18:54.116 A:middle
I'm going to look at how
those flow in the system

00:18:54.116 --> 00:18:55.326 A:middle
at the same time in parallel.

00:18:55.746 --> 00:18:56.606 A:middle
This is what we're
going to cover.

00:18:56.606 --> 00:19:00.856 A:middle
This is an example of the user
putting force on the trackpad,



00:18:56.606 --> 00:19:00.856 A:middle
This is an example of the user
putting force on the trackpad,

00:19:01.246 --> 00:19:02.716 A:middle
applying a click,
going all the way

00:19:02.716 --> 00:19:03.766 A:middle
to the Force click threshold,

00:19:03.766 --> 00:19:05.246 A:middle
and then releasing
pressure off of that.

00:19:05.316 --> 00:19:06.026 A:middle
That's their input.

00:19:06.526 --> 00:19:09.136 A:middle
Down here we're going to show
you the events as they're coming

00:19:09.136 --> 00:19:10.026 A:middle
into your application.

00:19:10.106 --> 00:19:13.246 A:middle
So the user starts off,
they're applying light pressure,

00:19:13.846 --> 00:19:15.786 A:middle
and these are all mouse moves.

00:19:15.846 --> 00:19:18.056 A:middle
We haven't reached a
click threshold yet.

00:19:18.386 --> 00:19:20.406 A:middle
We haven't even started
a pressure gesture yet.

00:19:20.486 --> 00:19:21.616 A:middle
These are just mouse moves,

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:23.596 A:middle
there are no pressure
gestures coming in.

00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:27.036 A:middle
You reach the click
threshold, a mouse down occurs,

00:19:27.566 --> 00:19:31.136 A:middle
and you also get a pressure
began event with a stage of 1

00:19:31.436 --> 00:19:33.686 A:middle
and the pressure value is
going to be 0 at this point.

00:19:34.386 --> 00:19:35.146 A:middle
We don't guarantee

00:19:35.146 --> 00:19:38.236 A:middle
if the pressure began event
occurs first or if the mouse

00:19:38.236 --> 00:19:41.106 A:middle
down occurs first; they
can swap sometimes.

00:19:41.886 --> 00:19:45.356 A:middle
The easiest way to handle that
is just look for the mouse down

00:19:45.426 --> 00:19:47.336 A:middle
and if you also want pressure
events, then start looking

00:19:47.336 --> 00:19:49.016 A:middle
for them after the
mouse down occurs.

00:19:49.516 --> 00:19:53.096 A:middle
As the user starts to apply
more force to the trackpad,

00:19:53.096 --> 00:19:55.076 A:middle
you see the pressure
rises up towards 1

00:19:55.076 --> 00:19:56.696 A:middle
as we approach the
Force click threshold.

00:19:57.206 --> 00:19:59.056 A:middle
If the cursor is moving,
these are going to come

00:19:59.056 --> 00:20:00.316 A:middle
through as mouse dragged events,



00:19:59.056 --> 00:20:00.316 A:middle
through as mouse dragged events,

00:20:00.536 --> 00:20:01.566 A:middle
you have the mouse
dragged events

00:20:01.566 --> 00:20:03.556 A:middle
and the pressure events --
we're still in stage 1 --

00:20:04.076 --> 00:20:05.686 A:middle
we reach the Force
click threshold,

00:20:06.356 --> 00:20:08.646 A:middle
you now get a pressure
gesture with a stage 2

00:20:08.646 --> 00:20:11.286 A:middle
and the pressure value
drops all the way back to 0.

00:20:11.286 --> 00:20:14.516 A:middle
The user continues to apply
more force on the trackpad,

00:20:14.916 --> 00:20:17.196 A:middle
the pressure starts to
increase again, as they start

00:20:17.196 --> 00:20:19.056 A:middle
to release the pressure
from the trackpad it starts

00:20:19.056 --> 00:20:20.436 A:middle
to go back down toward 0.

00:20:20.976 --> 00:20:23.266 A:middle
Now they have released it back
to the Force click threshold,

00:20:23.266 --> 00:20:24.326 A:middle
that pressure is at 0.

00:20:25.846 --> 00:20:27.426 A:middle
We're still at stage
2 at this point.

00:20:28.286 --> 00:20:30.536 A:middle
As the user releases
a bit more pressure,

00:20:30.666 --> 00:20:31.906 A:middle
we're still at stage 2.

00:20:31.906 --> 00:20:34.606 A:middle
We have actually exaggerated
it a little bit on this graph.

00:20:35.096 --> 00:20:37.706 A:middle
But it is very difficult for
somebody to hold pressure

00:20:37.706 --> 00:20:39.836 A:middle
at a constant rate
on the trackpad.

00:20:39.886 --> 00:20:42.086 A:middle
If they're right at the Force
click level they'll be going

00:20:42.086 --> 00:20:44.516 A:middle
above it and slightly
below it and we don't want

00:20:44.516 --> 00:20:47.236 A:middle
to be triggering Force click on
and off, on and off, on and off;

00:20:47.236 --> 00:20:49.096 A:middle
that's not what the
user's trying to do.

00:20:49.096 --> 00:20:52.396 A:middle
We require that you drop below
the Force click threshold a

00:20:52.396 --> 00:20:55.856 A:middle
little bit further before we
finally unlatch from stage 2,

00:20:56.376 --> 00:20:59.006 A:middle
and we give you finally
an event of stage 1.

00:20:59.496 --> 00:21:00.656 A:middle
And during that small section



00:20:59.496 --> 00:21:00.656 A:middle
And during that small section

00:21:00.656 --> 00:21:03.956 A:middle
of time the pressure is
going to be 0 in the event.

00:21:04.366 --> 00:21:06.236 A:middle
You're obviously below
the Force click threshold

00:21:06.236 --> 00:21:08.446 A:middle
where the pressure
would start to go up.

00:21:09.176 --> 00:21:13.146 A:middle
Then now that you're in stage
1, the user continues to release

00:21:13.346 --> 00:21:16.346 A:middle
and the pressure jumps up and
starts to come back down again.

00:21:16.346 --> 00:21:18.466 A:middle
You notice it didn't jump
all the way back up to 1,

00:21:18.466 --> 00:21:20.036 A:middle
because that's part
of the little gap.

00:21:20.636 --> 00:21:23.526 A:middle
One of the things to note
here is that this is one

00:21:23.526 --> 00:21:25.576 A:middle
of the reasons why you
shouldn't try to combine stage 1

00:21:25.576 --> 00:21:27.546 A:middle
and stage 2 to get a
larger dynamic range,

00:21:27.546 --> 00:21:30.236 A:middle
we're going to talk more
about that when we get

00:21:30.236 --> 00:21:32.336 A:middle
to the master section.

00:21:32.676 --> 00:21:33.966 A:middle
Whenever there's stage 2 occurs,

00:21:33.966 --> 00:21:37.166 A:middle
automatically we also provide
haptic feedback, so don't try

00:21:37.166 --> 00:21:38.896 A:middle
and combine the pressure
into two stages.

00:21:39.246 --> 00:21:41.866 A:middle
Either look at stage 1 and use
the pressure or look at stage 2

00:21:41.966 --> 00:21:43.466 A:middle
and use the pressure if
that's where you need

00:21:43.466 --> 00:21:48.936 A:middle
to do your animation or the
stage transition property.

00:21:48.936 --> 00:21:52.366 A:middle
We reached the click
threshold point for stage 1,

00:21:52.366 --> 00:21:54.666 A:middle
so your pressure is now back
down to 0, and just like we did

00:21:54.666 --> 00:21:57.026 A:middle
with the Force click
threshold, the user actually has

00:21:57.076 --> 00:21:58.756 A:middle
to release even more pressure

00:21:58.756 --> 00:22:03.496 A:middle
from the trackpad before we
finally release from stage 1.



00:21:58.756 --> 00:22:03.496 A:middle
from the trackpad before we
finally release from stage 1.

00:22:04.126 --> 00:22:06.746 A:middle
We're going to do a
pressure with a phase ended

00:22:06.746 --> 00:22:08.496 A:middle
at stage 0 and the mouse up.

00:22:08.906 --> 00:22:11.266 A:middle
Again, whether the
mouse up occurs first

00:22:11.266 --> 00:22:13.646 A:middle
or the pressure ended
event occurs first,

00:22:14.096 --> 00:22:16.806 A:middle
that is not guaranteed;
the easiest way to deal

00:22:16.806 --> 00:22:19.506 A:middle
with this is look for the
mouse up, track your pressure

00:22:19.506 --> 00:22:21.126 A:middle
and your mouse movements
at the same time

00:22:21.176 --> 00:22:22.966 A:middle
until the mouse up occurs.

00:22:23.246 --> 00:22:25.666 A:middle
Just ignore any pressure
events that might occur before

00:22:25.666 --> 00:22:26.746 A:middle
or after that sequence.

00:22:27.256 --> 00:22:32.416 A:middle
This will work with mice as
well as our older trackpads

00:22:32.466 --> 00:22:33.956 A:middle
and the new Force Touch
trackpads as well.

00:22:35.046 --> 00:22:37.526 A:middle
Finally, if the user is
moving around with very,

00:22:37.526 --> 00:22:39.936 A:middle
very light pressure after the
mouse up, these are mouse moves,

00:22:40.096 --> 00:22:42.456 A:middle
the pressure gesture has ended
and we're starting the cycle

00:22:42.456 --> 00:22:44.116 A:middle
over again as we did
in the beginning.

00:22:44.676 --> 00:22:49.166 A:middle
It gets real important to
know sometimes on the mouse

00:22:49.166 --> 00:22:50.966 A:middle
down if there is going

00:22:50.966 --> 00:22:53.396 A:middle
to be pressure associated
with this mouse down.

00:22:53.596 --> 00:22:56.596 A:middle
Is this coming from a device
that's emulating the mouse

00:22:56.676 --> 00:22:59.886 A:middle
and also issuing
pressure gesture events.

00:22:59.886 --> 00:23:01.926 A:middle
The way we have to
help you do this is



00:22:59.886 --> 00:23:01.926 A:middle
The way we have to
help you do this is

00:23:01.926 --> 00:23:03.916 A:middle
by using the associatedEventMask
property

00:23:04.486 --> 00:23:06.226 A:middle
on the mouse down events.

00:23:06.226 --> 00:23:08.216 A:middle
You can see this on the
mouse dragged events as well.

00:23:08.216 --> 00:23:09.996 A:middle
It is real easy to use.

00:23:09.996 --> 00:23:13.956 A:middle
You ask the mouse down event
for the associatedEventMask,

00:23:13.956 --> 00:23:16.256 A:middle
you find out if it contains
the EventMaskPressure,

00:23:16.366 --> 00:23:20.276 A:middle
if you're using Cocoa
you're just ending it

00:23:20.276 --> 00:23:21.806 A:middle
with the NSEventMaskPressure

00:23:21.806 --> 00:23:23.226 A:middle
because you're checking
the bit field.

00:23:24.606 --> 00:23:27.096 A:middle
If it does contain
the EventMaskPressure,

00:23:27.096 --> 00:23:29.396 A:middle
you know pressure events
are going to be coming,

00:23:29.436 --> 00:23:32.756 A:middle
and you can set it up so that
you have varying brush widths

00:23:33.026 --> 00:23:34.076 A:middle
for example in your drawing.

00:23:34.076 --> 00:23:34.876 A:middle
And that's great.

00:23:35.426 --> 00:23:37.146 A:middle
If it doesn't contain
the EventMaskPressure,

00:23:37.606 --> 00:23:41.296 A:middle
then it is coming from a mouse
or an older style trackpad

00:23:41.296 --> 00:23:43.166 A:middle
for example, and at
that point you want

00:23:43.166 --> 00:23:45.176 A:middle
to choose a default brush size,

00:23:45.246 --> 00:23:47.966 A:middle
usually you choose the maximum
brush size at that point

00:23:48.316 --> 00:23:51.546 A:middle
or maybe you want to just
choose half a brush size

00:23:51.726 --> 00:23:53.176 A:middle
and you use this constant value

00:23:53.586 --> 00:23:55.956 A:middle
for the entire mouse
dragging sequence.

00:23:56.446 --> 00:24:01.146 A:middle
That's the new
EventTypePressure,



00:23:56.446 --> 00:24:01.146 A:middle
That's the new
EventTypePressure,

00:24:01.146 --> 00:24:05.166 A:middle
it's got a lot of new
properties, it's got a phase,

00:24:05.536 --> 00:24:07.736 A:middle
because it is a gesture,
pressure which is

00:24:07.736 --> 00:24:10.746 A:middle
within the range of 0 to
1 for the current stage.

00:24:11.066 --> 00:24:12.886 A:middle
Of course you have
stage, you can easily see

00:24:12.886 --> 00:24:15.616 A:middle
when the user goes to Force
click, stage transitions

00:24:15.616 --> 00:24:18.506 A:middle
for animating those transitions,
the associated event mask

00:24:18.506 --> 00:24:20.266 A:middle
so you know when your
mouse events are going

00:24:20.266 --> 00:24:21.816 A:middle
to have pressure
associated with them,

00:24:22.186 --> 00:24:24.096 A:middle
and of course the
pressure change

00:24:24.096 --> 00:24:25.316 A:middle
with event responder method

00:24:25.536 --> 00:24:26.836 A:middle
if you're using the
responder methods.

00:24:27.326 --> 00:24:29.906 A:middle
Let's talk a little bit
about spring loading

00:24:29.906 --> 00:24:31.916 A:middle
and how NSButton
implemented spring loading;

00:24:32.026 --> 00:24:34.706 A:middle
you can use that exact same
API in your custom controls

00:24:34.706 --> 00:24:36.546 A:middle
to add spring loading
to your application.

00:24:37.896 --> 00:24:40.306 A:middle
There is an
NSSpringLoadingDestination

00:24:40.306 --> 00:24:43.676 A:middle
protocol; it's very similar to
NSDraggingDestination protocol

00:24:43.676 --> 00:24:45.006 A:middle
if you've ever implemented that.

00:24:45.006 --> 00:24:49.726 A:middle
In your destination, in your
destination view you need

00:24:49.726 --> 00:24:51.406 A:middle
to implement either
springLoadingEntered

00:24:51.406 --> 00:24:52.566 A:middle
or springLoadingUpdated.

00:24:53.276 --> 00:24:55.446 A:middle
To give you an example
of how these work,

00:24:55.446 --> 00:24:57.446 A:middle
NSButton implements
springLoadingEntered

00:24:57.446 --> 00:24:58.806 A:middle
and not springLoadingUpdated,

00:24:59.286 --> 00:25:01.436 A:middle
because a button is
either enabled or disabled,



00:24:59.286 --> 00:25:01.436 A:middle
because a button is
either enabled or disabled,

00:25:01.436 --> 00:25:02.756 A:middle
so as soon as you
enter the button,

00:25:03.076 --> 00:25:06.216 A:middle
it can return the spring-loading
options and it is not going

00:25:06.216 --> 00:25:07.396 A:middle
to change for the lifetime

00:25:07.396 --> 00:25:08.786 A:middle
that the drag is
occurring in the button.

00:25:09.476 --> 00:25:11.236 A:middle
NSSegmentedControl,
on the other hand,

00:25:11.326 --> 00:25:12.856 A:middle
implements springLoadingUpdated.

00:25:13.326 --> 00:25:16.046 A:middle
Each segment may be enabled
or disabled independently

00:25:16.046 --> 00:25:19.626 A:middle
of each other, it's one view,
so with springLoadingUpdated,

00:25:20.166 --> 00:25:23.366 A:middle
segmented control can watch
the drag and find out exactly

00:25:23.366 --> 00:25:24.546 A:middle
where in the control the drag is

00:25:24.546 --> 00:25:26.406 A:middle
and dynamically change the
spring-loading options.

00:25:26.896 --> 00:25:28.716 A:middle
As I mentioned, you need to --

00:25:29.076 --> 00:25:30.426 A:middle
if you implement one
of these methods,

00:25:30.536 --> 00:25:32.756 A:middle
you need to implement
spring-loading options.

00:25:32.756 --> 00:25:35.996 A:middle
You can implement both if
you want, you don't have

00:25:35.996 --> 00:25:37.776 A:middle
to implement just one of
these, you need to implement

00:25:37.776 --> 00:25:38.716 A:middle
at least one of these though.

00:25:38.716 --> 00:25:41.396 A:middle
For your spring-loading
options, it is pretty obvious,

00:25:41.396 --> 00:25:43.496 A:middle
you return if spring
loading should be enabled

00:25:43.496 --> 00:25:45.366 A:middle
or disabled, that's pretty easy.

00:25:45.366 --> 00:25:47.606 A:middle
We also have a couple of
other interesting options,

00:25:47.606 --> 00:25:49.016 A:middle
continuous activation --

00:25:49.536 --> 00:25:52.526 A:middle
generally a spring-loading
action is discrete,

00:25:52.526 --> 00:25:53.506 A:middle
spring loading occurred,

00:25:53.746 --> 00:25:56.846 A:middle
the button fires its
action, it is over.

00:25:57.286 --> 00:25:58.716 A:middle
There is also a continuous
version

00:25:58.716 --> 00:26:00.466 A:middle
which we'll cover
a little bit more



00:25:58.716 --> 00:26:00.466 A:middle
which we'll cover
a little bit more

00:26:00.466 --> 00:26:02.126 A:middle
in the next couple of slides.

00:26:02.216 --> 00:26:04.096 A:middle
I want to move on to no hover.

00:26:05.496 --> 00:26:07.996 A:middle
As I mentioned earlier, spring
loading can be triggered either

00:26:07.996 --> 00:26:11.146 A:middle
with a hover, which
works great for people

00:26:11.146 --> 00:26:12.586 A:middle
that don't have Force
Touch trackpads

00:26:12.586 --> 00:26:13.516 A:middle
or you can Force click.

00:26:14.676 --> 00:26:17.266 A:middle
If you want to do a Force
click on a canvas for example

00:26:17.266 --> 00:26:20.286 A:middle
that has a large area, and the
user is just dragging the item

00:26:20.286 --> 00:26:22.976 A:middle
across the canvas, they're just
trying to get across the canvas,

00:26:23.136 --> 00:26:24.806 A:middle
and they lift the
finger up to come back

00:26:24.806 --> 00:26:26.636 A:middle
down to continue the
drag, or lift the mouse

00:26:26.636 --> 00:26:27.776 A:middle
up to continue the drag,

00:26:28.416 --> 00:26:30.546 A:middle
that amount of time
might be just long enough

00:26:30.546 --> 00:26:34.116 A:middle
that the cursor stays still that
spring loading is activated.

00:26:34.936 --> 00:26:37.176 A:middle
So this would be a
false activation,

00:26:37.176 --> 00:26:38.726 A:middle
that wasn't what the
user was trying to do.

00:26:39.396 --> 00:26:41.206 A:middle
If you have a situation
where you're getting a lot

00:26:41.206 --> 00:26:44.516 A:middle
of false activations because
of hover, then you might want

00:26:44.516 --> 00:26:47.086 A:middle
to consider the no hover
spring-loading option

00:26:47.266 --> 00:26:49.956 A:middle
which will still allow users
with the Force Touch trackpad

00:26:50.026 --> 00:26:52.366 A:middle
to do a Force click
to get spring loading

00:26:52.506 --> 00:26:53.496 A:middle
in that area of your view.

00:26:54.306 --> 00:26:57.556 A:middle
Use it sparingly, make sure
that you really think about it

00:26:57.556 --> 00:26:59.146 A:middle
because we don't want
to leave out any users

00:26:59.146 --> 00:27:00.676 A:middle
that don't have a
Force Touch trackpad,



00:26:59.146 --> 00:27:00.676 A:middle
that don't have a
Force Touch trackpad,

00:27:01.056 --> 00:27:03.816 A:middle
but if you're getting
more false activations,

00:27:04.036 --> 00:27:05.616 A:middle
this is a good option
to use sometimes.

00:27:07.496 --> 00:27:09.446 A:middle
Along with springLoadingEntered
and Updated,

00:27:09.446 --> 00:27:11.216 A:middle
of course we have
springLoadingExited --

00:27:11.216 --> 00:27:13.776 A:middle
this lets you know when the
drag has exited your view --

00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:15.296 A:middle
and there's also draggingEnded.

00:27:15.496 --> 00:27:17.816 A:middle
Spring loading is part of
the drag and drop operations,

00:27:17.816 --> 00:27:21.746 A:middle
so if the user has
dragged over your view

00:27:21.956 --> 00:27:24.656 A:middle
and your spring-loading
destination

00:27:24.916 --> 00:27:26.356 A:middle
and you implement draggingEnded,

00:27:26.866 --> 00:27:29.336 A:middle
when the dragging does
completed, when the user lets go

00:27:29.336 --> 00:27:30.696 A:middle
of the mouse, cancels the drag,

00:27:31.376 --> 00:27:33.266 A:middle
you will get back
the draggingEnded.

00:27:33.396 --> 00:27:36.256 A:middle
Whether this drag, whether
the user completed the drag

00:27:36.256 --> 00:27:37.106 A:middle
in your application

00:27:37.106 --> 00:27:39.066 A:middle
or in another process,
it doesn't matter.

00:27:39.506 --> 00:27:41.926 A:middle
Everybody that's implemented
draggingUpdated will get

00:27:41.926 --> 00:27:42.526 A:middle
their callback.

00:27:42.736 --> 00:27:46.836 A:middle
Since this is part of dragging,

00:27:47.356 --> 00:27:52.976 A:middle
the NSDraggingDestination also
has a draggingEnded function.

00:27:53.176 --> 00:27:55.136 A:middle
It is the exact same
function we have here.

00:27:55.136 --> 00:27:57.286 A:middle
If you are both a Spring
Loading destination

00:27:57.356 --> 00:28:00.546 A:middle
and an NSDraggingDestination,
you only need



00:27:57.356 --> 00:28:00.546 A:middle
and an NSDraggingDestination,
you only need

00:28:00.546 --> 00:28:02.526 A:middle
to have one implementation
of draggingEnded,

00:28:02.526 --> 00:28:04.976 A:middle
it applies to both, so you'll
need to do any cleanup you need

00:28:04.976 --> 00:28:07.296 A:middle
to do for both Spring Loading
and dragging destination

00:28:07.686 --> 00:28:09.556 A:middle
if you're both a Spring
Loading destination

00:28:09.636 --> 00:28:12.866 A:middle
and a dragging destination
at the same time.

00:28:13.086 --> 00:28:15.596 A:middle
Now we get to the really fun
stuff about spring loading.

00:28:16.106 --> 00:28:18.596 A:middle
So you're required to implement
springLoadingActivated.

00:28:18.926 --> 00:28:21.806 A:middle
This is where we
tell your destination

00:28:21.806 --> 00:28:23.286 A:middle
that the user has spring loaded.

00:28:24.486 --> 00:28:26.276 A:middle
We have a Boolean value,
which is normally yes.

00:28:26.616 --> 00:28:29.166 A:middle
As I mentioned, spring
loading is a discrete action,

00:28:29.166 --> 00:28:32.046 A:middle
it has occurred, and
NSButton just fires its action

00:28:32.916 --> 00:28:36.196 A:middle
and everybody is happy.

00:28:36.426 --> 00:28:39.556 A:middle
But if you have that
continuous bit set, then as soon

00:28:39.556 --> 00:28:40.756 A:middle
as the user Force clicks,

00:28:41.376 --> 00:28:43.186 A:middle
we'll send a
springLoadingActivated yes,

00:28:43.186 --> 00:28:45.506 A:middle
you can start a timer,
you can add continuously

00:28:45.676 --> 00:28:49.066 A:middle
on that timer firing your action
message, and when you release

00:28:49.066 --> 00:28:54.186 A:middle
from Force click it will respond
with a springLoadingActivated no

00:28:54.186 --> 00:28:56.526 A:middle
and that you know to turn
off your timer at that point.

00:28:56.936 --> 00:28:58.536 A:middle
If the user is using hover,

00:28:59.076 --> 00:29:00.616 A:middle
you will get the
springLoadingActivated



00:28:59.076 --> 00:29:00.616 A:middle
you will get the
springLoadingActivated

00:29:00.616 --> 00:29:03.916 A:middle
at the hover timeout with
a yes, and you'll get a no

00:29:03.916 --> 00:29:05.126 A:middle
when they move out
of the control.

00:29:06.506 --> 00:29:09.026 A:middle
Again to compare this to
the normal discrete action,

00:29:09.286 --> 00:29:11.526 A:middle
usually spring loading
from Force click occurs

00:29:11.756 --> 00:29:14.216 A:middle
on the release of Force click,
so they move all the way

00:29:14.216 --> 00:29:15.596 A:middle
down into Force click, it's

00:29:15.596 --> 00:29:17.406 A:middle
when they release Force
click you will get a

00:29:17.406 --> 00:29:20.056 A:middle
springLoadingActivated yes, if
you're not using continuous;

00:29:20.336 --> 00:29:22.156 A:middle
that's the one that
we generally suggest

00:29:22.156 --> 00:29:23.356 A:middle
that you use unless you need

00:29:23.356 --> 00:29:29.196 A:middle
to continuously fire your action
message during a spring load.

00:29:29.196 --> 00:29:31.146 A:middle
Lastly, we have
springLoadingHighlightChanged.

00:29:31.626 --> 00:29:33.666 A:middle
We like to give the user
feedback on what's going on.

00:29:33.716 --> 00:29:35.746 A:middle
We have three forms
of highlighting: None,

00:29:35.966 --> 00:29:37.246 A:middle
Standard, and Emphasized.

00:29:38.676 --> 00:29:41.566 A:middle
When you get a
springLoadingHighlightChanged

00:29:41.696 --> 00:29:44.816 A:middle
message, you need to ask
the draggingInfo for what

00:29:44.816 --> 00:29:48.246 A:middle
that springLoadingHighlight
is, set your view

00:29:48.246 --> 00:29:51.546 A:middle
that needs display, and
then you update and you draw

00:29:51.546 --> 00:29:52.866 A:middle
with the correct highlighting.

00:29:54.236 --> 00:29:56.756 A:middle
What's important here is that
you don't try to infer any kind

00:29:56.756 --> 00:29:59.476 A:middle
of behavior that the user
is doing with this yet.

00:29:59.896 --> 00:30:02.046 A:middle
That's what
springLoadingActivated is for.



00:29:59.896 --> 00:30:02.046 A:middle
That's what
springLoadingActivated is for.

00:30:04.236 --> 00:30:08.216 A:middle
Sort of like when you select
an item from a menu we blink

00:30:08.216 --> 00:30:10.496 A:middle
that menu item to let
the user know and confirm

00:30:10.496 --> 00:30:13.466 A:middle
that they have selected that
item, we'll do something similar

00:30:13.466 --> 00:30:14.936 A:middle
to that in spring loading,

00:30:14.936 --> 00:30:17.306 A:middle
and we do that by
changing the highlighting,

00:30:17.676 --> 00:30:19.646 A:middle
and so all you have
to do is just draw

00:30:19.646 --> 00:30:21.736 A:middle
with the new highlighting
style whenever requested

00:30:22.096 --> 00:30:24.866 A:middle
and you'll get a consistent
look in your application

00:30:24.866 --> 00:30:25.986 A:middle
to match the rest of the system.

00:30:26.356 --> 00:30:27.686 A:middle
Use springLoadingActivated
to know

00:30:27.686 --> 00:30:29.116 A:middle
when to fire the
action messages.

00:30:29.486 --> 00:30:32.126 A:middle
That's Spring Loading
Destination.

00:30:33.236 --> 00:30:34.886 A:middle
We have Alignment
Feedback, you can see this

00:30:34.886 --> 00:30:37.086 A:middle
in Interface Builder when
you get two items together,

00:30:37.086 --> 00:30:39.256 A:middle
we snap them together, draw that
nice little alignment guide.

00:30:40.106 --> 00:30:42.476 A:middle
We have some new API
to help you do this.

00:30:42.646 --> 00:30:45.326 A:middle
The drawing is up to you, but
our new API helps you decide

00:30:45.326 --> 00:30:46.326 A:middle
when to do the snapping.

00:30:47.076 --> 00:30:50.616 A:middle
To give you an example of that,
let's look at a tracking loop,

00:30:50.616 --> 00:30:51.786 A:middle
a typical tracking loop.

00:30:51.786 --> 00:30:53.676 A:middle
Let's zoom in on that.

00:30:53.676 --> 00:30:54.946 A:middle
You get your mouse down event,

00:30:54.946 --> 00:30:57.836 A:middle
you figure out what your event
mask is, which events you want

00:30:57.836 --> 00:31:01.666 A:middle
to track, you ask for the next
event, you move your item,



00:30:57.836 --> 00:31:01.666 A:middle
to track, you ask for the next
event, you move your item,

00:31:01.766 --> 00:31:04.156 A:middle
update your data model,
set your needs display,

00:31:04.156 --> 00:31:06.706 A:middle
is this a mouse up, no, and
you just continue the cycle,

00:31:06.866 --> 00:31:10.346 A:middle
you draw whenever drawRect is
called and you drag your item

00:31:10.346 --> 00:31:12.586 A:middle
across the screen until
the mouse up occurs.

00:31:13.396 --> 00:31:16.486 A:middle
We have an
NSAlignmentFeedbackFilter object

00:31:16.486 --> 00:31:17.556 A:middle
to help you out with this.

00:31:18.956 --> 00:31:20.456 A:middle
You get your mouse down,
the first thing you do,

00:31:20.456 --> 00:31:21.976 A:middle
you get the input event mask

00:31:21.976 --> 00:31:23.636 A:middle
from the Alignment
Feedback filter.

00:31:23.636 --> 00:31:27.746 A:middle
This is the events that the
Alignment Feedback filter needs

00:31:27.746 --> 00:31:31.506 A:middle
to know about, you just or them
or union them in the Swift case

00:31:31.506 --> 00:31:34.676 A:middle
with your event mask for when
you call nextEventMatchingMask.

00:31:35.576 --> 00:31:38.916 A:middle
Once you get the next event,
the very first thing you do,

00:31:38.916 --> 00:31:41.256 A:middle
you give that event to the
Alignment Feedback filter,

00:31:41.256 --> 00:31:42.506 A:middle
it's going to return right away,

00:31:42.506 --> 00:31:44.106 A:middle
it just updates some
internal state.

00:31:44.946 --> 00:31:48.746 A:middle
You move -- excuse me, if you're
using a pan gesture recognizer,

00:31:48.746 --> 00:31:51.076 A:middle
you can also update with the
pan gesture recognizer --

00:31:51.076 --> 00:31:52.746 A:middle
it works very similar
to a tracking loop,

00:31:52.996 --> 00:31:56.276 A:middle
everything applies except for
this one message difference.

00:31:58.256 --> 00:32:00.006 A:middle
Once Alignment Feedback
filter returns



00:31:58.256 --> 00:32:00.006 A:middle
Once Alignment Feedback
filter returns

00:32:00.006 --> 00:32:03.596 A:middle
from processing the input, you
move the item in your data model

00:32:03.596 --> 00:32:06.086 A:middle
as you normally would, and
then you prepare alignment.

00:32:06.616 --> 00:32:09.366 A:middle
Let's dig in to prepareAlignment
a bit and you're going

00:32:09.366 --> 00:32:12.536 A:middle
to use the Alignment Feedback
filter to help you do that.

00:32:12.536 --> 00:32:14.746 A:middle
We have the object in the
data model previously,

00:32:14.746 --> 00:32:17.156 A:middle
we got the event, and we decided
the user moved it to here,

00:32:17.256 --> 00:32:18.646 A:middle
this is the default location

00:32:19.066 --> 00:32:20.736 A:middle
that if we don't
do any snapping,

00:32:20.856 --> 00:32:22.476 A:middle
this is where the object
is going to end up.

00:32:23.246 --> 00:32:26.336 A:middle
We want to know, should we
snap it here, should we snap it

00:32:26.336 --> 00:32:29.146 A:middle
down to this line, or should
we snap both at the same time

00:32:29.146 --> 00:32:30.156 A:middle
and get it down in the corner.

00:32:31.416 --> 00:32:34.356 A:middle
Use the Alignment Feedback
filter object to help

00:32:34.356 --> 00:32:35.066 A:middle
to decide this,

00:32:35.066 --> 00:32:37.866 A:middle
alignmentFeedbackToken
ForHorizontalMovementInView

00:32:37.866 --> 00:32:40.186 A:middle
(without space), previousX,
alignedX, and defaultX,

00:32:40.806 --> 00:32:43.086 A:middle
these coordinates are in
the window coordinates space

00:32:43.086 --> 00:32:47.256 A:middle
so it works really well
regardless of your zoom level

00:32:47.256 --> 00:32:48.496 A:middle
that you might have
in your view.

00:32:49.836 --> 00:32:52.046 A:middle
If snapping should
occur, we will go ahead

00:32:52.046 --> 00:32:54.316 A:middle
and return you an
Alignment Feedback token.

00:32:55.016 --> 00:32:56.776 A:middle
If you don't get an
Alignment Feedback token,

00:32:56.776 --> 00:32:57.656 A:middle
don't do any alignment.

00:32:57.656 --> 00:32:59.076 A:middle
If you get an Alignment
Feedback token,

00:32:59.416 --> 00:33:01.776 A:middle
in your data model change
the X position in this case



00:32:59.416 --> 00:33:01.776 A:middle
in your data model change
the X position in this case

00:33:02.006 --> 00:33:04.536 A:middle
to the aligned position
and hang on to

00:33:04.536 --> 00:33:05.706 A:middle
that Alignment Feedback token.

00:33:06.656 --> 00:33:09.336 A:middle
You can then check for
vertical movement as well,

00:33:09.336 --> 00:33:11.536 A:middle
except you send your Y
values instead of your X

00:33:11.816 --> 00:33:14.396 A:middle
and again you may or may not
get an Alignment Feedback token.

00:33:14.966 --> 00:33:17.116 A:middle
If you've gotten two Alignment
Feedback tokens you'll have

00:33:17.116 --> 00:33:19.536 A:middle
aligned in both axes and
so your object will be

00:33:19.536 --> 00:33:20.866 A:middle
down here in the corner.

00:33:22.896 --> 00:33:25.196 A:middle
Then sometimes -- this
happens more rarely,

00:33:25.196 --> 00:33:28.156 A:middle
but sometimes you only
want to snap to a position

00:33:28.696 --> 00:33:32.446 A:middle
if it is both aligned on
the X axis and the Y axis,

00:33:32.726 --> 00:33:35.756 A:middle
and it's either aligned to both
axes or aligned to neither,

00:33:35.966 --> 00:33:39.256 A:middle
in that case we have Alignment
Feedback token for movement

00:33:39.256 --> 00:33:42.196 A:middle
and you pass in points
instead of an individual X

00:33:42.196 --> 00:33:45.386 A:middle
or Y coordinate, and it
works the same way, you may

00:33:45.386 --> 00:33:49.246 A:middle
or may not get an
Alignment Feedback token.

00:33:49.946 --> 00:33:53.936 A:middle
You iterate over the various
items that are being dragged

00:33:53.936 --> 00:33:56.276 A:middle
that they can snap to, you get
back your Alignment Feedback

00:33:56.276 --> 00:33:59.146 A:middle
tokens and you change your data
model if snapping should happen,

00:33:59.686 --> 00:34:02.276 A:middle
and now you have a
collection of tokens.



00:33:59.686 --> 00:34:02.276 A:middle
and now you have a
collection of tokens.

00:34:02.766 --> 00:34:04.366 A:middle
You want to perform
haptic feedback

00:34:04.416 --> 00:34:06.326 A:middle
to the user using the
new Force Touch trackpad.

00:34:07.266 --> 00:34:09.806 A:middle
We'll use the Alignment Feedback
filter to help us do that;

00:34:09.806 --> 00:34:11.306 A:middle
we'll just ask the
Alignment Feedback filter

00:34:11.306 --> 00:34:13.156 A:middle
to perform feedback
at a performance time,

00:34:13.616 --> 00:34:15.686 A:middle
just use the default for the
performance time for now,

00:34:15.686 --> 00:34:17.985 A:middle
we'll cover performance times
a little bit more later.

00:34:18.835 --> 00:34:20.856 A:middle
Then you just pass the
array a feedback token.

00:34:21.036 --> 00:34:23.326 A:middle
You can even pass an empty
array if nothing was aligned

00:34:23.596 --> 00:34:26.235 A:middle
and Alignment Feedback
filter is robust with that,

00:34:26.235 --> 00:34:27.446 A:middle
it knows to just do nothing.

00:34:28.496 --> 00:34:30.116 A:middle
Then you set that your
view needs display

00:34:30.466 --> 00:34:35.815 A:middle
and you redraw whenever you're
asked; if you have the tokens,

00:34:35.866 --> 00:34:37.315 A:middle
then you know when
you're redrawing

00:34:37.315 --> 00:34:41.226 A:middle
to also draw alignment guides if
that's appropriate for your UI.

00:34:41.565 --> 00:34:43.846 A:middle
The feedback will then be
performed synchronously

00:34:43.846 --> 00:34:46.516 A:middle
with the screen change and
the user will have a nice

00:34:46.516 --> 00:34:49.196 A:middle
synchronous -- sees the
alignment guide pop up

00:34:49.376 --> 00:34:50.596 A:middle
and they feel the
haptic feedback

00:34:50.596 --> 00:34:53.196 A:middle
from the trackpad
at the same time.

00:34:53.326 --> 00:34:56.916 A:middle
If the user is not using a Force
Touch trackpad the Alignment

00:34:56.916 --> 00:34:59.016 A:middle
Feedback filter knows how
to work with that as well,

00:34:59.356 --> 00:35:01.536 A:middle
and so you just have to write it



00:34:59.356 --> 00:35:01.536 A:middle
and so you just have to write it

00:35:01.536 --> 00:35:02.956 A:middle
as if there is a
Force Touch trackpad;

00:35:03.006 --> 00:35:04.566 A:middle
if there's not, it
just works great.

00:35:05.106 --> 00:35:08.996 A:middle
So that's all there really is

00:35:09.126 --> 00:35:10.826 A:middle
to using Alignment
Feedback filters.

00:35:11.026 --> 00:35:13.196 A:middle
They're pretty simple
APIs, real easy to add it

00:35:13.196 --> 00:35:15.716 A:middle
to your application and
existing tracking loops,

00:35:16.086 --> 00:35:17.566 A:middle
provided a consistent
feel across app,

00:35:17.796 --> 00:35:20.846 A:middle
we look at the velocity of
the cursor, for example,

00:35:21.076 --> 00:35:23.696 A:middle
so that we don't do snapping
if the user is moving quickly,

00:35:23.696 --> 00:35:24.286 A:middle
because we don't want

00:35:24.286 --> 00:35:26.406 A:middle
to do Alignment Feedback
either at that point.

00:35:26.966 --> 00:35:28.576 A:middle
That's not what the
user is trying to do,

00:35:28.996 --> 00:35:30.456 A:middle
we look at the modifier values,

00:35:30.936 --> 00:35:32.686 A:middle
and so this will
provide a consistent feel

00:35:32.686 --> 00:35:35.366 A:middle
across all applications that are
using the system-wide Alignment

00:35:35.366 --> 00:35:36.006 A:middle
Feedback API.

00:35:36.976 --> 00:35:39.756 A:middle
And you can use this for more
than just dragging a item;

00:35:40.106 --> 00:35:42.506 A:middle
if you're doing a resize for
example or a size to fit,

00:35:42.676 --> 00:35:44.786 A:middle
that's another good place to
use Alignment Feedback filter.

00:35:45.176 --> 00:35:47.566 A:middle
It could be used in a
lot of different places.

00:35:48.016 --> 00:35:50.656 A:middle
So that's everything you
need to know to be a knight.

00:35:50.656 --> 00:35:51.286 A:middle
Congratulations.

00:35:51.286 --> 00:35:53.456 A:middle
You're all knights in using
the Force Touch trackpad.

00:35:55.046 --> 00:35:56.976 A:middle
Let's move on to
becoming masters.

00:35:57.506 --> 00:35:59.086 A:middle
This is all about
controlling the force.

00:35:59.576 --> 00:36:01.316 A:middle
This is about configuring
the trackpad



00:35:59.576 --> 00:36:01.316 A:middle
This is about configuring
the trackpad

00:36:01.316 --> 00:36:04.526 A:middle
so that it works appropriately
for your custom situations

00:36:04.736 --> 00:36:06.366 A:middle
and manually providing
haptic feedback.

00:36:06.986 --> 00:36:11.616 A:middle
Let's go back to
that drawing example.

00:36:12.776 --> 00:36:14.716 A:middle
You start to do a
drawing and you press

00:36:14.716 --> 00:36:16.906 A:middle
on the Force Touch trackpad,
you get a Force click

00:36:17.106 --> 00:36:19.206 A:middle
and that's not really
appropriate in your drawing.

00:36:19.206 --> 00:36:20.866 A:middle
And as I mentioned earlier,
you don't want to try

00:36:20.866 --> 00:36:23.256 A:middle
to combine the pressure
values from stage 1

00:36:23.256 --> 00:36:25.666 A:middle
with with the pressure values
from stage 2, it's not going

00:36:25.666 --> 00:36:27.856 A:middle
to be even during the
release, and the user's going

00:36:27.856 --> 00:36:29.726 A:middle
to get this haptic feedback
in the middle of the drawing,

00:36:29.726 --> 00:36:31.106 A:middle
that's not a good experience.

00:36:32.006 --> 00:36:33.406 A:middle
So we want to configure
the trackpad

00:36:33.446 --> 00:36:37.876 A:middle
to not provide Force click
actuations at all in that case.

00:36:37.876 --> 00:36:38.816 A:middle
And this is what we can do

00:36:38.816 --> 00:36:40.236 A:middle
with the pressure
configuration object.

00:36:40.526 --> 00:36:42.716 A:middle
We initialize one with
a pressureBehavior,

00:36:43.386 --> 00:36:45.776 A:middle
check out the header file
and the documentation,

00:36:45.776 --> 00:36:49.106 A:middle
check out NSEvent.h,
there's a lot of description

00:36:49.106 --> 00:36:50.586 A:middle
in the header file
about each of these,

00:36:50.586 --> 00:36:51.576 A:middle
I'm not going to cover them all.

00:36:51.936 --> 00:36:54.656 A:middle
The default one is
DeepClick, that's what happens

00:36:54.656 --> 00:36:55.606 A:middle
by default in the system.

00:36:55.606 --> 00:36:57.526 A:middle
In this case we want
PrimaryGeneric;

00:36:57.946 --> 00:37:00.466 A:middle
PrimaryGeneric is a
one-stage gesture,



00:36:57.946 --> 00:37:00.466 A:middle
PrimaryGeneric is a
one-stage gesture,

00:37:00.786 --> 00:37:03.386 A:middle
so the user won't get
a Force click actuation

00:37:03.386 --> 00:37:04.496 A:middle
when they're drawing,

00:37:04.966 --> 00:37:08.686 A:middle
and it provides the largest
dynamic range of user input

00:37:08.686 --> 00:37:11.596 A:middle
of their force on the trackpad,
mapping that back out to you

00:37:11.596 --> 00:37:12.966 A:middle
and to pressure between 0 and 1.

00:37:13.256 --> 00:37:15.686 A:middle
It's the best one to use
for drawing and for a lot

00:37:15.686 --> 00:37:18.386 A:middle
of other situations, and
then check the header files

00:37:18.386 --> 00:37:21.416 A:middle
for the descriptions of
the other behaviors to see

00:37:21.416 --> 00:37:22.966 A:middle
which one is appropriate
for your situation.

00:37:23.436 --> 00:37:25.976 A:middle
Once you have a pressure
configuration,

00:37:25.976 --> 00:37:26.656 A:middle
you just call set.

00:37:26.806 --> 00:37:29.506 A:middle
The trackpad is now configured
in this new configuration

00:37:29.876 --> 00:37:32.556 A:middle
and everything is great
-- with some caveats.

00:37:33.206 --> 00:37:34.866 A:middle
You can only set the trackpad

00:37:34.866 --> 00:37:37.786 A:middle
into a different configuration
during a mouse drag,

00:37:37.966 --> 00:37:40.046 A:middle
so on mouse down, you
check the mouse location,

00:37:40.046 --> 00:37:41.406 A:middle
if it is supposed to be changed

00:37:41.406 --> 00:37:42.726 A:middle
for this specific
mouse location,

00:37:43.526 --> 00:37:45.646 A:middle
create a pressure
configuration, you call the set,

00:37:45.646 --> 00:37:47.016 A:middle
and the trackpad is
going to be changed.

00:37:47.896 --> 00:37:50.586 A:middle
You need to realize that
you're racing the user here.

00:37:51.306 --> 00:37:55.736 A:middle
The user might move the cursor
over your view, go immediately

00:37:55.736 --> 00:37:57.386 A:middle
to a Force click,
release the mouse,

00:37:57.386 --> 00:37:58.886 A:middle
and you didn't even
get the mouse down yet,

00:37:58.986 --> 00:38:02.026 A:middle
perhaps you're being paged
in from virtual memory



00:37:58.986 --> 00:38:02.026 A:middle
perhaps you're being paged
in from virtual memory

00:38:02.026 --> 00:38:03.386 A:middle
and your app is not responsive.

00:38:04.316 --> 00:38:07.386 A:middle
You can try to set the pressure,
the trackpad configuration

00:38:07.386 --> 00:38:10.766 A:middle
at this point but the user is
already completed their gesture,

00:38:11.026 --> 00:38:12.106 A:middle
and it won't take effect.

00:38:12.676 --> 00:38:17.066 A:middle
When you do set the
trackpad configuration it is

00:38:17.066 --> 00:38:19.336 A:middle
automatically reset back
to the system default

00:38:19.336 --> 00:38:21.536 A:middle
when the user ends the gesture
as well, so you don't have

00:38:21.536 --> 00:38:22.496 A:middle
to worry about unsetting it.

00:38:23.256 --> 00:38:26.516 A:middle
But this isn't ideal for most
situations; it is really useful

00:38:26.516 --> 00:38:30.126 A:middle
when you need to decide at
the very last minute based

00:38:30.126 --> 00:38:32.086 A:middle
on the mouse location what
the configuration should be.

00:38:33.016 --> 00:38:37.516 A:middle
Instead, just set the pressure
configuration on NSView.

00:38:38.366 --> 00:38:40.226 A:middle
Create a pressure
configuration ahead of time,

00:38:40.426 --> 00:38:42.076 A:middle
set it as the pressure
configuration property

00:38:42.076 --> 00:38:44.346 A:middle
on the NSView and the
system will go ahead and set

00:38:44.346 --> 00:38:46.396 A:middle
up the trackpad before
mouse down even occurs.

00:38:46.396 --> 00:38:48.776 A:middle
In fact, the system can
configure the trackpad

00:38:48.776 --> 00:38:50.766 A:middle
to this configuration even

00:38:50.766 --> 00:38:52.566 A:middle
if your app isn't
being responsive yet.

00:38:53.086 --> 00:38:56.436 A:middle
Now the user can go ahead and
interact with your application,

00:38:56.436 --> 00:38:57.856 A:middle
you didn't even get
the mouse down yet,

00:38:58.146 --> 00:38:59.956 A:middle
but they didn't feel the
Force click because it is

00:38:59.956 --> 00:39:04.066 A:middle
in the PrimaryGeneric
behavior and the events you get



00:38:59.956 --> 00:39:04.066 A:middle
in the PrimaryGeneric
behavior and the events you get

00:39:04.066 --> 00:39:06.546 A:middle
in from the application,
from the system at that point

00:39:07.066 --> 00:39:08.476 A:middle
when you finally
do get your events

00:39:08.476 --> 00:39:12.076 A:middle
if you're not being responsive,
don't have Force click in them,

00:39:12.076 --> 00:39:12.996 A:middle
they don't go to stage 2.

00:39:12.996 --> 00:39:16.386 A:middle
Let's talk a little bit
about haptic feedback.

00:39:18.176 --> 00:39:20.346 A:middle
Haptic feedback should
be used sparingly.

00:39:20.726 --> 00:39:22.056 A:middle
This is for subtle interactions.

00:39:22.056 --> 00:39:23.996 A:middle
We just want the trackpad
to just feel right, right?

00:39:25.166 --> 00:39:26.706 A:middle
So when the user is
trying to align something,

00:39:26.706 --> 00:39:28.536 A:middle
they get that haptic
feedback and it feels great,

00:39:28.616 --> 00:39:30.686 A:middle
we're not trying to massage
the user's finger here,

00:39:31.016 --> 00:39:33.036 A:middle
we just want this to
be subtle interaction.

00:39:33.876 --> 00:39:37.126 A:middle
In fact, if the user
goes back to one

00:39:37.126 --> 00:39:38.906 A:middle
of our older trackpads
we want them

00:39:38.906 --> 00:39:41.356 A:middle
to maybe not even realize
why something is wrong

00:39:41.356 --> 00:39:42.926 A:middle
but it just doesn't
quite feel right.

00:39:43.386 --> 00:39:47.526 A:middle
That's the point of using the
haptic feedback is doing it

00:39:47.766 --> 00:39:50.056 A:middle
appropriately when the user
is trying to do something

00:39:50.056 --> 00:39:52.246 A:middle
to give them that little
bit of subtle feedback,

00:39:52.416 --> 00:39:53.896 A:middle
oh yes, this is just right.

00:39:53.896 --> 00:39:55.256 A:middle
This is how it should
have always been,

00:39:55.256 --> 00:39:55.986 A:middle
and I didn't know that.

00:39:56.706 --> 00:39:57.586 A:middle
Subtle interactions.

00:39:58.596 --> 00:40:00.356 A:middle
You just ask the
NSHapticFeedbackManager



00:39:58.596 --> 00:40:00.356 A:middle
You just ask the
NSHapticFeedbackManager

00:40:00.356 --> 00:40:02.976 A:middle
for the defaultPerformer, always
ask for the defaultPerformer

00:40:02.976 --> 00:40:05.826 A:middle
because it can change
based on the input device

00:40:06.226 --> 00:40:09.506 A:middle
and the user's preferences.

00:40:10.196 --> 00:40:11.886 A:middle
You ask to perform
the feedback pattern

00:40:11.886 --> 00:40:14.486 A:middle
at a specific performance
time, we have three --

00:40:14.956 --> 00:40:17.476 A:middle
three patterns: Generic,
Alignment, and LevelChange.

00:40:17.666 --> 00:40:19.396 A:middle
Alignment can be used for
a lot of different things,

00:40:19.886 --> 00:40:23.896 A:middle
even if you're just rotating
a photo to align a horizon,

00:40:23.896 --> 00:40:26.196 A:middle
for example, you can go ahead
and use alignment for that.

00:40:26.566 --> 00:40:30.226 A:middle
LevelChange is what NSButton
uses in the multilevel mode;

00:40:30.226 --> 00:40:32.606 A:middle
it will provide haptic
feedback as the levels change.

00:40:33.306 --> 00:40:35.856 A:middle
If those two don't sufficiently
describe what you're trying

00:40:35.856 --> 00:40:37.916 A:middle
to do, then go ahead
and just use generic.

00:40:39.066 --> 00:40:42.166 A:middle
You want your haptic feedback
to perform synchronously

00:40:42.166 --> 00:40:44.246 A:middle
with what's going on
the screen so that

00:40:44.316 --> 00:40:45.656 A:middle
by default that's
the DrawCompleted.

00:40:45.656 --> 00:40:47.626 A:middle
If you're using Cocoa
drawing or core animation,

00:40:47.876 --> 00:40:50.856 A:middle
you just use a DrawCompleted
performance time

00:40:50.996 --> 00:40:54.066 A:middle
and this will just automatically
synchronize them for you

00:40:54.066 --> 00:40:57.106 A:middle
so that you can determine your
haptic feedbacks during event

00:40:57.106 --> 00:40:59.836 A:middle
processing and your drawing can
just concentrate on drawing.



00:41:00.306 --> 00:41:02.396 A:middle
If you're using Medal
or OpenGL directly,

00:41:02.666 --> 00:41:05.816 A:middle
then you can just use Now and
as things update on the screen,

00:41:06.126 --> 00:41:09.336 A:middle
you will go ahead and need to
make sure that you line them

00:41:09.336 --> 00:41:10.956 A:middle
up so that they occur
simultaneously.

00:41:12.126 --> 00:41:13.086 A:middle
That's all there is.

00:41:13.276 --> 00:41:15.746 A:middle
You're now all masters in
using the Force Touch trackpad.

00:41:16.356 --> 00:41:18.376 A:middle
I can't wait to see what
you do with these things

00:41:18.376 --> 00:41:20.966 A:middle
in your application, we have
covered Table Row Actions,

00:41:20.966 --> 00:41:24.326 A:middle
accelerator buttons,
Spring Loading, we've talked

00:41:24.516 --> 00:41:26.516 A:middle
about how the force
flows through the system,

00:41:26.756 --> 00:41:29.776 A:middle
doing Alignment Feedback, and
finally controlling the trackpad

00:41:29.776 --> 00:41:32.206 A:middle
and configuring it for
your specific needs.

00:41:32.616 --> 00:41:35.596 A:middle
There's a lot that
you can do here.

00:41:35.796 --> 00:41:37.856 A:middle
That little app that I
did earlier in my demo,

00:41:37.856 --> 00:41:39.786 A:middle
it's called Force Touch
Catalog, you can download

00:41:39.786 --> 00:41:40.526 A:middle
that and check that out.

00:41:40.526 --> 00:41:43.306 A:middle
We also have an alignment
guide sample application,

00:41:43.306 --> 00:41:44.796 A:middle
so that's really
great to use as well.

00:41:44.796 --> 00:41:49.066 A:middle
I suggest that you also
check out the What's New

00:41:49.066 --> 00:41:50.876 A:middle
in Web Development
in WebKit and Safari

00:41:50.876 --> 00:41:54.676 A:middle
so you can learn how
Safari is exposing pressure

00:41:54.676 --> 00:41:58.246 A:middle
in the web environment.

00:41:59.596 --> 00:42:03.496 A:middle
We have a lab coming up
right after this, the Cocoa



00:41:59.596 --> 00:42:03.496 A:middle
We have a lab coming up
right after this, the Cocoa

00:42:03.496 --> 00:42:06.156 A:middle
and Force Touch and Gesture
lab; I will of course be there.

00:42:06.426 --> 00:42:08.926 A:middle
I'm real excited to hear your
ideas on how to use Force Touch

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:12.046 A:middle
in your applications or
even to show me anything

00:42:12.046 --> 00:42:14.726 A:middle
that you have already done,
I'm really excited to see that

00:42:14.726 --> 00:42:15.666 A:middle
and to talk about it with you.

00:42:15.666 --> 00:42:18.036 A:middle
Please come find me in the
lab right after this session.

00:42:18.776 --> 00:42:19.656 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:42:19.656 --> 00:42:20.396 A:middle
Enjoy the rest of the show.

00:42:21.516 --> 00:42:24.500 A:middle
[Applause]
