00:00:24.516 --> 00:00:26.746 A:middle
[Applause]

00:00:27.246 --> 00:00:27.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; DOUG WYATT: Good morning.

00:00:29.706 --> 00:00:32.686 A:middle
I'm Doug Wyatt from the
Core Audio team and I would

00:00:32.686 --> 00:00:34.516 A:middle
like to show you something
new we have been working

00:00:34.516 --> 00:00:36.986 A:middle
on called Audio Unit Extensions.

00:00:37.386 --> 00:00:42.416 A:middle
This is a new technology in
iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan.

00:00:43.946 --> 00:00:46.786 A:middle
About Audio Units: we've
had had this technology

00:00:46.786 --> 00:00:51.316 A:middle
in our operating systems since
the beginning OS X and iOS.

00:00:52.096 --> 00:00:54.436 A:middle
The operating system
includes a great number

00:00:54.436 --> 00:00:57.756 A:middle
of built-in units ranging
from I/O units and mixers,

00:00:58.116 --> 00:01:02.386 A:middle
a lot of different effects
ranging to software sampler.



00:00:58.116 --> 00:01:02.386 A:middle
a lot of different effects
ranging to software sampler.

00:01:04.086 --> 00:01:06.436 A:middle
We use these internal
Audio Units in many

00:01:06.436 --> 00:01:09.166 A:middle
of our higher-level
APIs, for example,

00:01:09.356 --> 00:01:10.736 A:middle
the media playback stack.

00:01:12.076 --> 00:01:15.756 A:middle
But Audio Units are also a
widely adopted third-party

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:17.806 A:middle
plug-in format on OS X.

00:01:18.216 --> 00:01:21.056 A:middle
There are literally thousands
of third-party Audio Units

00:01:21.056 --> 00:01:23.616 A:middle
in the market out there.

00:01:24.246 --> 00:01:25.916 A:middle
Now, Audio Unit extensions

00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:28.936 A:middle
for the first time bring
us a full plug-in model

00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:31.736 A:middle
on both OS X and iOS.

00:01:32.016 --> 00:01:35.266 A:middle
It is built on top of the
app extension technology,

00:01:35.746 --> 00:01:39.006 A:middle
which means if you are writing
plug-ins you can package them

00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:42.646 A:middle
into apps, and those apps can
be sold on the App Stores.

00:01:43.516 --> 00:01:49.186 A:middle
[Applause]

00:01:49.686 --> 00:01:53.256 A:middle
As part of this technology,
we have modernized the API and

00:01:53.736 --> 00:01:56.616 A:middle
yet at the same time
maintained compatibility,

00:01:57.116 --> 00:02:00.236 A:middle
and in this session I will go
through details of this new API,



00:01:57.116 --> 00:02:00.236 A:middle
and in this session I will go
through details of this new API,

00:02:01.216 --> 00:02:05.096 A:middle
which we are calling the
version 3 Audio Unit API.

00:02:05.916 --> 00:02:10.175 A:middle
It's based on an Objective-C
class called AUAudioUnit that's

00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:11.626 A:middle
in the Audio Unit framework.

00:02:12.036 --> 00:02:15.766 A:middle
And as an Objective-C class,
of course, it plays nicely

00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:19.256 A:middle
with Swift, as we will see.

00:02:19.946 --> 00:02:21.966 A:middle
In this session, we are also
going to look at a number

00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:24.516 A:middle
of classes in the
AVFoundation framework.

00:02:25.146 --> 00:02:28.996 A:middle
We have AV Audio Unit
component manager

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:31.456 A:middle
and AV Audio Unit component.

00:02:32.146 --> 00:02:35.656 A:middle
These are used to located the
audio components on the system.

00:02:36.376 --> 00:02:38.666 A:middle
Those appear for the
first time in iOS 9.

00:02:39.296 --> 00:02:40.936 A:middle
They also exist on Yosemite.

00:02:41.736 --> 00:02:45.296 A:middle
And we will also be using
AVAudioEngine in some

00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:47.366 A:middle
of our example code we
will be showing today,

00:02:48.206 --> 00:02:50.806 A:middle
in particular the
AVAudioUnit class

00:02:50.806 --> 00:02:52.796 A:middle
and AVAudioUnitEffect class.

00:02:53.216 --> 00:02:56.276 A:middle
Those have been available
since last year's OS releases.

00:02:58.536 --> 00:03:00.306 A:middle
So about compatibility now.



00:02:58.536 --> 00:03:00.306 A:middle
So about compatibility now.

00:03:00.306 --> 00:03:02.666 A:middle
This is how things
look now in OS X.

00:03:03.036 --> 00:03:05.646 A:middle
We have our existing
version 2 Audio Unit hosts

00:03:06.056 --> 00:03:09.246 A:middle
and existing version 2
Audio Unit implementations.

00:03:09.616 --> 00:03:12.036 A:middle
The hosts start their
communication

00:03:12.036 --> 00:03:13.866 A:middle
with audio component
instance new,

00:03:14.526 --> 00:03:16.696 A:middle
and our implementations
are built

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.986 A:middle
on audio component
factory functions.

00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:23.676 A:middle
We have a new set of APIs here,

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:26.826 A:middle
so we will have new hosts
using those new APIs.

00:03:26.826 --> 00:03:31.556 A:middle
And new Audio Units implemented
using those new APIs.

00:03:32.296 --> 00:03:35.566 A:middle
Hosts will communicate with
the class AU Audio Unit.

00:03:35.996 --> 00:03:40.066 A:middle
New version 3 Audio Units
will subclass AU Audio Unit.

00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:42.916 A:middle
So that's two separate APIs.

00:03:42.916 --> 00:03:44.876 A:middle
What are we going to
do to be compatible?

00:03:44.926 --> 00:03:48.626 A:middle
We have built bridges
between these two APIs.

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:52.606 A:middle
So thanks to these
bridges, we will find

00:03:52.606 --> 00:03:57.236 A:middle
that new version 3 hosts should
be almost completely compatible

00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:59.536 A:middle
with existing version
2 Audio Units.



00:04:00.286 --> 00:04:04.606 A:middle
And conversely, existing version
2 hosts would only need minor

00:04:04.606 --> 00:04:08.476 A:middle
source changes to work with
new version 3 Audio Units.

00:04:08.806 --> 00:04:12.266 A:middle
And I will detail those API
changes in a little bit.

00:04:15.456 --> 00:04:17.646 A:middle
So now I would like
to give you a demo

00:04:17.646 --> 00:04:19.796 A:middle
of a new Audio Unit working

00:04:19.796 --> 00:04:22.906 A:middle
in an only slightly modified
version of Logic Pro.

00:04:23.016 --> 00:04:29.356 A:middle
I have a little session here,
it has a drum loop built in.

00:04:29.606 --> 00:04:34.536 A:middle
And here I'm going to apply
an Audio Unit to this track.

00:04:35.946 --> 00:04:38.626 A:middle
So here are all of the
Apple built-in Audio Units.

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:45.406 A:middle
And here I have a new demo
Audio Unit called v3 Distortion.

00:04:46.696 --> 00:04:48.376 A:middle
So I can open this Audio Unit.

00:04:49.376 --> 00:04:55.246 A:middle
I can find the preset I like,
and we can hear Logic playing

00:04:55.246 --> 00:04:55.976 A:middle
through this Audio Unit.

00:04:56.516 --> 00:05:01.576 A:middle
[Music]



00:04:56.516 --> 00:05:01.576 A:middle
[Music]

00:05:02.076 --> 00:05:04.646 A:middle
There it's dry.

00:05:04.986 --> 00:05:05.816 A:middle
Completely distorted.

00:05:06.816 --> 00:05:09.306 A:middle
Now, if I go to activity
monitor here,

00:05:10.096 --> 00:05:13.296 A:middle
we can see that this
distortion Audio Unit is running

00:05:13.486 --> 00:05:17.306 A:middle
in a separate process,
AU v3 distortion.

00:05:17.706 --> 00:05:19.806 A:middle
It's consuming a
little bit of CPU.

00:05:20.326 --> 00:05:21.896 A:middle
It has some threads running.

00:05:23.086 --> 00:05:27.976 A:middle
Now, suppose this Audio Unit
has a bug in it, and it crashes.

00:05:27.976 --> 00:05:30.366 A:middle
Well, I can simulate that
here in activity monitor.

00:05:31.016 --> 00:05:32.886 A:middle
I can force quit it.

00:05:33.116 --> 00:05:36.476 A:middle
And notice in Logic,
the view went blank

00:05:36.886 --> 00:05:38.196 A:middle
but the music kept playing.

00:05:39.516 --> 00:05:48.676 A:middle
[Applause]

00:05:49.176 --> 00:05:51.546 A:middle
So here is a diagram of what
we were just looking at.

00:05:52.036 --> 00:05:54.966 A:middle
That's a slightly modified
version of Logic Pro,

00:05:55.746 --> 00:05:58.606 A:middle
but it's still basically
communicating using the existing

00:05:58.606 --> 00:06:03.846 A:middle
version 2 API, which is bridged
to AU Audio Unit and in turn,



00:05:58.606 --> 00:06:03.846 A:middle
version 2 API, which is bridged
to AU Audio Unit and in turn,

00:06:04.116 --> 00:06:06.526 A:middle
in that separate
extension service process,

00:06:06.916 --> 00:06:10.616 A:middle
we saw the distortion units
AU Audio Unit subclass running

00:06:11.296 --> 00:06:13.036 A:middle
along with its custom
View Controller.

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:16.216 A:middle
In the Logic process, there
is also a View Controller,

00:06:16.796 --> 00:06:18.626 A:middle
and you see how these
are bridged

00:06:19.206 --> 00:06:21.286 A:middle
across the process boundary.

00:06:24.906 --> 00:06:27.596 A:middle
Now, I'd like to talk
about hosting Audio Units

00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:32.046 A:middle
and I will show you an example
that uses the version 3 APIs.

00:06:32.156 --> 00:06:35.286 A:middle
We have sample code called
Audio Unit v3 Example.

00:06:35.716 --> 00:06:38.236 A:middle
I checked a couple of hours
ago, but it hadn't appeared yet.

00:06:38.566 --> 00:06:42.616 A:middle
I hope it comes out today.

00:06:42.916 --> 00:06:45.336 A:middle
In this sample code project,
you will see there are a number

00:06:45.336 --> 00:06:48.186 A:middle
of targets and one of
them is called AU Host.

00:06:49.006 --> 00:06:51.876 A:middle
Now, this application is fairly
simple and straightforward,

00:06:52.276 --> 00:06:55.586 A:middle
but it shows how to find and
open Audio Units that are

00:06:55.586 --> 00:06:58.486 A:middle
on the system, how to
connect them together

00:06:58.826 --> 00:07:02.316 A:middle
into a rendering chain, how
to select Audio Unit presets,



00:06:58.826 --> 00:07:02.316 A:middle
into a rendering chain, how
to select Audio Unit presets,

00:07:02.766 --> 00:07:05.656 A:middle
and how to open an Audio
Unit's custom view.

00:07:07.496 --> 00:07:11.066 A:middle
So in the AU host app, we have
something called simple play

00:07:11.066 --> 00:07:14.946 A:middle
engine, which is a Swift
class that uses AVAudioEngine.

00:07:14.986 --> 00:07:19.146 A:middle
It uses an AV audio
player node connected

00:07:19.146 --> 00:07:20.426 A:middle
to an AV Audio Unit effect.

00:07:20.426 --> 00:07:23.266 A:middle
That AV Audio Unit effect

00:07:23.266 --> 00:07:26.556 A:middle
in turn exposed an
underlying AU Audio Unit,

00:07:27.146 --> 00:07:30.776 A:middle
which is the maiden class of
the version 3 Audio Unit API.

00:07:31.756 --> 00:07:33.546 A:middle
We have the player
to the effect,

00:07:33.546 --> 00:07:34.986 A:middle
to the mixer, to the output.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:37.416 A:middle
That's how the simple
play engine makes sound.

00:07:38.316 --> 00:07:42.966 A:middle
We will also see how to use the
AV Audio Unit component manager

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:46.476 A:middle
class to select from the
AV Audio Unit components

00:07:46.476 --> 00:07:50.146 A:middle
on the system and use
that to control what kind

00:07:50.146 --> 00:07:52.596 A:middle
of AV Audio Unit
effect gets selected.

00:07:52.596 --> 00:07:56.466 A:middle
So let's get into a
little bit of code,

00:07:56.466 --> 00:07:59.746 A:middle
but first there is a very
fundamental data structure here

00:07:59.746 --> 00:08:01.276 A:middle
when working with Audio Units.



00:07:59.746 --> 00:08:01.276 A:middle
when working with Audio Units.

00:08:01.866 --> 00:08:03.796 A:middle
We have the audio
component description

00:08:04.296 --> 00:08:07.596 A:middle
and its first three fields:
the component type, type,

00:08:07.736 --> 00:08:10.386 A:middle
subtype, and manufacturer.

00:08:10.816 --> 00:08:14.626 A:middle
That tuple uniquely identifies
an Audio Unit in the system.

00:08:15.236 --> 00:08:16.756 A:middle
The flags are also important.

00:08:16.756 --> 00:08:19.556 A:middle
They are partially populated
by the audio component,

00:08:19.946 --> 00:08:23.356 A:middle
and there are new ones
populated by the system.

00:08:23.356 --> 00:08:25.686 A:middle
We will describe some
of those as we go along.

00:08:26.136 --> 00:08:28.336 A:middle
The important thing
here is this is the key

00:08:28.336 --> 00:08:29.956 A:middle
that identifies the plug-in.

00:08:31.776 --> 00:08:34.946 A:middle
So to find Audio Unit
components on the system,

00:08:35.836 --> 00:08:38.926 A:middle
the first thing we do is create
an audio component description

00:08:39.666 --> 00:08:41.316 A:middle
that contains a wildcard.

00:08:41.666 --> 00:08:43.726 A:middle
Here we say the component
type is effect.

00:08:43.836 --> 00:08:46.706 A:middle
That's not a wildcard, but
we have component subtype

00:08:46.706 --> 00:08:48.456 A:middle
and manufacturer of zero.

00:08:48.806 --> 00:08:51.786 A:middle
Those are wildcards, so we have
built a component description

00:08:51.786 --> 00:08:54.056 A:middle
here that identifies any effect.

00:08:55.536 --> 00:09:00.606 A:middle
And then we can take that any
effect component description



00:08:55.536 --> 00:09:00.606 A:middle
And then we can take that any
effect component description

00:09:00.606 --> 00:09:03.496 A:middle
and pass it to AV Audio
Unit component manager,

00:09:04.106 --> 00:09:06.106 A:middle
and it will give us
back all of the effects

00:09:06.106 --> 00:09:08.736 A:middle
on the system matching
that wildcard.

00:09:09.626 --> 00:09:13.366 A:middle
So here we get an array of AV
Audio Unit component objects,

00:09:13.976 --> 00:09:18.396 A:middle
and those contain things
like the name, tags,

00:09:18.866 --> 00:09:23.366 A:middle
also the audio component
description of that unit.

00:09:25.336 --> 00:09:27.486 A:middle
So here we have got an
array of components.

00:09:27.486 --> 00:09:28.876 A:middle
We can pass that back to the UI,

00:09:28.876 --> 00:09:34.146 A:middle
and in turn the UI can call this
method in the simple play engine

00:09:34.526 --> 00:09:37.946 A:middle
to select one of these
previously vended

00:09:38.656 --> 00:09:39.776 A:middle
effect components.

00:09:40.136 --> 00:09:41.706 A:middle
So here it gives us a component.

00:09:42.176 --> 00:09:44.586 A:middle
We are going to fetch the
audio component description

00:09:44.586 --> 00:09:50.196 A:middle
out of that, pass it to an
internal method, and the guts

00:09:50.196 --> 00:09:51.806 A:middle
of that internal method is here.

00:09:52.286 --> 00:09:56.436 A:middle
We are going to call a new
class method of AV Audio Unit.

00:09:57.296 --> 00:10:01.026 A:middle
And this method asks it to
create an instance based



00:09:57.296 --> 00:10:01.026 A:middle
And this method asks it to
create an instance based

00:10:01.026 --> 00:10:03.106 A:middle
on the component
description we have here.

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:07.316 A:middle
Now, this is an asynchronous
function, meaning it's going

00:10:07.316 --> 00:10:09.316 A:middle
to go off and start
instantiating it,

00:10:09.756 --> 00:10:11.846 A:middle
and then it's going
to call this closure

00:10:12.846 --> 00:10:18.046 A:middle
when it actually has
instantiated the Audio Unit

00:10:18.046 --> 00:10:20.556 A:middle
and we are ready to use it.

00:10:21.486 --> 00:10:22.986 A:middle
So here we are in our callback.

00:10:22.986 --> 00:10:24.796 A:middle
This is Swift closure syntax.

00:10:25.396 --> 00:10:27.646 A:middle
We have our AV Audio Unit.

00:10:29.306 --> 00:10:32.996 A:middle
And then we can attach
it to our engine.

00:10:33.476 --> 00:10:36.286 A:middle
We have stored it into a
member variable, the effect.

00:10:37.606 --> 00:10:43.806 A:middle
And now we have an AV Audio
Unit know that's the effect.

00:10:43.806 --> 00:10:45.576 A:middle
We are going to patch
that into the engine.

00:10:46.156 --> 00:10:48.506 A:middle
We will disconnect the
effect from the main mixer,

00:10:49.206 --> 00:10:51.586 A:middle
then connect from the
player to the effect.

00:10:52.896 --> 00:10:55.896 A:middle
And then from the effect
to the main mixer node.

00:10:57.446 --> 00:10:59.576 A:middle
So now we have got an
effect in our play engine.



00:11:01.426 --> 00:11:05.626 A:middle
And now we can store the
actual AU Audio Unit.

00:11:06.066 --> 00:11:08.346 A:middle
That's the plug-in, and
here we can do all kinds

00:11:08.346 --> 00:11:09.246 A:middle
of interesting things

00:11:09.246 --> 00:11:13.626 A:middle
like manipulate the component's
effect, presets, and parameters.

00:11:14.936 --> 00:11:18.946 A:middle
For instance, here, we will just
get the list of factory presets.

00:11:20.586 --> 00:11:23.476 A:middle
And this too can
populate a field

00:11:23.476 --> 00:11:25.426 A:middle
in the table view --
rather, in the UI.

00:11:27.236 --> 00:11:29.356 A:middle
So the user can choose
the factory preset.

00:11:31.236 --> 00:11:34.106 A:middle
And finally, I would
like to show you how

00:11:34.316 --> 00:11:35.876 A:middle
in the app I will
show you in a minute,

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:39.146 A:middle
we can get the Audio Unit's
custom view and embed it

00:11:39.196 --> 00:11:40.966 A:middle
into the host application's
view.

00:11:41.546 --> 00:11:43.906 A:middle
Here we are in the View
Controller of the host,

00:11:43.906 --> 00:11:47.476 A:middle
so we are going to ask the play
engine, give me your Audio Unit,

00:11:47.866 --> 00:11:49.816 A:middle
and then we are going
to ask the Audio Unit

00:11:49.896 --> 00:11:50.896 A:middle
for a View Controller.

00:11:51.216 --> 00:11:52.916 A:middle
When it's done with that,
it will call us back

00:11:52.916 --> 00:11:56.486 A:middle
with a View Controller that we
can embed in the host's view.

00:11:58.266 --> 00:12:00.826 A:middle
Okay. I would like to bring up
my colleague Michael Hopkins now



00:11:58.266 --> 00:12:00.826 A:middle
Okay. I would like to bring up
my colleague Michael Hopkins now

00:12:01.266 --> 00:12:03.396 A:middle
to show you this app
actually running now.

00:12:06.516 --> 00:12:12.216 A:middle
[Applause]

00:12:12.716 --> 00:12:13.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL HOPKINS: Thank
you very much, Doug.

00:12:14.176 --> 00:12:16.446 A:middle
I'm delighted to have
this opportunity today

00:12:16.446 --> 00:12:21.316 A:middle
to show you this
AVAudioEngine-based v3 host

00:12:21.316 --> 00:12:23.356 A:middle
application running
on an iPad here.

00:12:24.156 --> 00:12:25.766 A:middle
As you can see, I'm
going to launch

00:12:25.766 --> 00:12:28.146 A:middle
that by tapping the
icon for the host.

00:12:29.126 --> 00:12:31.936 A:middle
And on the left-hand side of
the screen we have a list of all

00:12:31.936 --> 00:12:35.106 A:middle
of the effects Audio Units
that are present on the system.

00:12:35.486 --> 00:12:38.196 A:middle
And this includes both
the built-in Apple audio

00:12:38.196 --> 00:12:40.486 A:middle
component-based effects as well

00:12:40.486 --> 00:12:43.566 A:middle
as several new extension-based
v3 Audio Units I

00:12:43.566 --> 00:12:44.566 A:middle
installed myself.

00:12:45.776 --> 00:12:48.956 A:middle
At the top of the screen, I have
a Play button that I can tap

00:12:49.056 --> 00:12:51.656 A:middle
to toggle the playback
of a drum loop.

00:12:52.736 --> 00:12:56.006 A:middle
Now, let's see how I can
apply some effect nodes

00:12:56.216 --> 00:12:57.386 A:middle
and add them to the graph.

00:12:57.956 --> 00:12:59.596 A:middle
First, I will play
this with no effect

00:12:59.596 --> 00:13:01.436 A:middle
and then I will add
a couple effects



00:12:59.596 --> 00:13:01.436 A:middle
and then I will add
a couple effects

00:13:01.436 --> 00:13:02.666 A:middle
so you can hear that working.

00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:08.626 A:middle
[Music]

00:13:09.126 --> 00:13:12.896 A:middle
With the high pass filter,
it's filtering out almost all

00:13:12.896 --> 00:13:16.186 A:middle
of the sounds of the cymbals
and other higher frequencies.

00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:21.916 A:middle
A delay, which is a little
bit hard to hear in this room.

00:13:22.366 --> 00:13:24.476 A:middle
And I'm going to go
ahead and stop that.

00:13:24.876 --> 00:13:26.096 A:middle
So now I would like to show you

00:13:26.096 --> 00:13:29.556 A:middle
for the first time an
extension-based Audio Unit

00:13:29.556 --> 00:13:31.006 A:middle
running on this iPad.

00:13:31.006 --> 00:13:33.896 A:middle
That is the distortion demo.

00:13:34.696 --> 00:13:37.576 A:middle
When I select that, now
you can see the list of all

00:13:37.576 --> 00:13:40.436 A:middle
of the factory presets that
the Audio Unit is publishing.

00:13:41.246 --> 00:13:43.816 A:middle
These include some
drum-specific ones as well

00:13:43.816 --> 00:13:47.156 A:middle
as some really crazy, wild
effects like alien chatter.

00:13:48.466 --> 00:13:49.666 A:middle
Now, as Doug mentioned ,

00:13:49.816 --> 00:13:53.916 A:middle
v3 Audio Unit can have
a custom view on iOS.

00:13:54.566 --> 00:13:56.156 A:middle
And I'm going to show you that.

00:13:56.156 --> 00:13:57.906 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead
and tap the View button.

00:13:58.396 --> 00:14:02.506 A:middle
And what we have done is we
have loaded that View Controller



00:13:58.396 --> 00:14:02.506 A:middle
And what we have done is we
have loaded that View Controller

00:14:02.506 --> 00:14:04.486 A:middle
from the Audio Unit
and I have installed it

00:14:04.486 --> 00:14:08.426 A:middle
as a child View Controller
within our application context.

00:14:08.426 --> 00:14:11.846 A:middle
So for the first time, we
have a built in Audio Unit

00:14:11.846 --> 00:14:13.936 A:middle
with a UI running in our host.

00:14:15.096 --> 00:14:20.176 A:middle
We have a large slider, excuse
me, a large knob that I can use

00:14:20.176 --> 00:14:21.806 A:middle
to control the amount
of distortion.

00:14:22.876 --> 00:14:24.566 A:middle
And let me go ahead
and play that for you

00:14:24.566 --> 00:14:25.916 A:middle
so you can hear that in action.

00:14:27.516 --> 00:14:43.546 A:middle
[Music]

00:14:44.046 --> 00:14:45.416 A:middle
It's really a lot of fun.

00:14:45.416 --> 00:14:47.896 A:middle
It's an amazing experience
to be able to have

00:14:47.896 --> 00:14:52.366 A:middle
that Multi-Touch UI working
fluidly in a host application

00:14:52.366 --> 00:14:55.316 A:middle
without having to go through
all of the hassle of switching

00:14:55.316 --> 00:14:57.676 A:middle
out to another application,
doing some tweaks,

00:14:57.676 --> 00:14:59.036 A:middle
switching back to your host,

00:14:59.366 --> 00:15:01.306 A:middle
starting recording,
switching back.



00:14:59.366 --> 00:15:01.306 A:middle
starting recording,
switching back.

00:15:01.306 --> 00:15:03.046 A:middle
Now, you won't have
to do that ever again.

00:15:04.516 --> 00:15:08.586 A:middle
[Applause]

00:15:09.086 --> 00:15:09.516 A:middle
Thank you.

00:15:10.746 --> 00:15:12.456 A:middle
And I'd also like
to point out further

00:15:12.456 --> 00:15:15.876 A:middle
that this is the same Audio Unit
that you saw running in Logic

00:15:15.876 --> 00:15:17.566 A:middle
in Doug's earlier demo.

00:15:17.956 --> 00:15:21.056 A:middle
In fact, the source code for
the Audio Unit is identical.

00:15:21.056 --> 00:15:22.336 A:middle
No changes were required.

00:15:22.906 --> 00:15:26.666 A:middle
The drawing code is also
very similar because I chose

00:15:26.666 --> 00:15:28.526 A:middle
to write this using
Core Animation

00:15:28.526 --> 00:15:30.826 A:middle
so that API is almost
fully portable.

00:15:31.486 --> 00:15:33.316 A:middle
The only changes
that were necessary

00:15:33.316 --> 00:15:36.936 A:middle
to bring this Audio Unit to
iOS are in the event model,

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.486 A:middle
whereas we have had to use
the touch events in UIKit

00:15:39.546 --> 00:15:45.086 A:middle
versus the AppKit mouse
events on the desktop.

00:15:45.496 --> 00:15:47.666 A:middle
So really you guys
have an opportunity

00:15:47.666 --> 00:15:52.486 A:middle
to with only a few changes
to publish an Audio Unit both

00:15:52.486 --> 00:15:54.216 A:middle
on the desktop and on iOS.

00:15:54.696 --> 00:15:55.976 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:15:56.016 --> 00:15:57.256 A:middle
[Applause]

00:15:57.256 --> 00:15:57.846 A:middle
Back to you, Doug.



00:16:00.236 --> 00:16:02.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; DOUG WYATT: Thank
you, Michael.

00:16:05.656 --> 00:16:08.806 A:middle
So I would like to talk
about using Audio Units

00:16:09.176 --> 00:16:11.626 A:middle
in your host applications
in situations

00:16:11.626 --> 00:16:13.626 A:middle
where you are not
using AVAudioEngine.

00:16:14.446 --> 00:16:18.026 A:middle
We have a similar method
on the AU Audio Unit class

00:16:18.546 --> 00:16:20.706 A:middle
to asynchronously
create an instance

00:16:20.706 --> 00:16:21.986 A:middle
of the component description.

00:16:21.986 --> 00:16:22.736 A:middle
You see that there.

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:26.726 A:middle
We also, for those of you
with existing version 2 hosts,

00:16:27.066 --> 00:16:29.886 A:middle
a minimal translation path is

00:16:29.946 --> 00:16:32.406 A:middle
to start using audio
component instantiate.

00:16:32.796 --> 00:16:35.916 A:middle
We will talk about that
in detail in a bit.

00:16:37.626 --> 00:16:39.556 A:middle
Now, I would like to
talk about the subject

00:16:39.556 --> 00:16:42.116 A:middle
of extension service processes

00:16:42.116 --> 00:16:45.306 A:middle
versus plug-ins loaded
into host processes.

00:16:47.066 --> 00:16:50.356 A:middle
Now, as anybody who has worked
with Audio Units is aware,

00:16:50.356 --> 00:16:52.306 A:middle
of course, with our
existing plug-in model,

00:16:52.636 --> 00:16:55.456 A:middle
the plug-ins are always loaded
into the host's progress,

00:16:55.876 --> 00:16:59.566 A:middle
and this remains true
for version 3 hosts.

00:16:59.796 --> 00:17:03.336 A:middle
If it's a version 2 existing
plug-in, and that might be one



00:16:59.796 --> 00:17:03.336 A:middle
If it's a version 2 existing
plug-in, and that might be one

00:17:03.336 --> 00:17:05.616 A:middle
of the Apple built-in
ones on iOS

00:17:05.616 --> 00:17:09.136 A:middle
or it could be a third-party
one on OS X, but in any case

00:17:09.796 --> 00:17:13.465 A:middle
if it's a version 2 Audio Unit,
regardless of any other factor,

00:17:13.465 --> 00:17:15.376 A:middle
it's always in the
host's process.

00:17:17.016 --> 00:17:20.346 A:middle
Now, version 3 Audio Units have
a slightly more complicated

00:17:20.346 --> 00:17:21.016 A:middle
story here.

00:17:21.665 --> 00:17:25.415 A:middle
By default, version 3
Audio Units are loaded

00:17:25.415 --> 00:17:28.096 A:middle
into a separate extension
service process.

00:17:28.435 --> 00:17:31.186 A:middle
And this is the diagram
we saw before with Logic.

00:17:32.306 --> 00:17:35.766 A:middle
This is true, again,
whether it's a version 2 host

00:17:35.766 --> 00:17:36.976 A:middle
or a version 3 host.

00:17:38.086 --> 00:17:43.326 A:middle
Now, on OS X only it is
possible for the plug-in

00:17:43.326 --> 00:17:46.096 A:middle
to be loaded directly
into the host's process.

00:17:46.616 --> 00:17:50.096 A:middle
Now, for this to happen,
both parties have to opt in.

00:17:50.626 --> 00:17:54.136 A:middle
The host when instantiating
the Audio Unit has

00:17:54.136 --> 00:17:55.836 A:middle
to pass this option to any

00:17:55.836 --> 00:17:58.806 A:middle
of the asynchronous
creation methods we just saw,

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:02.696 A:middle
and you see the name of that
new flag there called Load



00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:02.696 A:middle
and you see the name of that
new flag there called Load

00:18:02.696 --> 00:18:03.526 A:middle
in Process.

00:18:04.066 --> 00:18:07.556 A:middle
And the Audio Unit also has
to be packaged specially

00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:12.216 A:middle
and consent to this with
a plist entry called Audio

00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:13.176 A:middle
Component Bundle.

00:18:13.856 --> 00:18:15.866 A:middle
So if both parties do opt in,

00:18:16.246 --> 00:18:19.776 A:middle
then the framework will
actually load the plug-in

00:18:19.836 --> 00:18:21.256 A:middle
into the host's process.

00:18:21.416 --> 00:18:23.586 A:middle
So the host will be
communicating directly

00:18:23.586 --> 00:18:27.466 A:middle
with the plug-in's AU
Audio Unit subclass.

00:18:30.016 --> 00:18:33.036 A:middle
Now, as a host author, why
would you want to do this?

00:18:33.556 --> 00:18:35.986 A:middle
There is a tradeoff
here between safety

00:18:35.986 --> 00:18:37.396 A:middle
and performance is the reason.

00:18:37.896 --> 00:18:41.326 A:middle
Of course, it's a security risk
to be loading third-party code

00:18:41.326 --> 00:18:46.056 A:middle
into your app, and if it
crashes inside your app,

00:18:46.406 --> 00:18:48.796 A:middle
then users might
blame you instead

00:18:48.796 --> 00:18:50.076 A:middle
of the misbehaving plug-in.

00:18:51.516 --> 00:18:54.316 A:middle
But on the other hand, we
have performance reasons

00:18:54.316 --> 00:18:57.836 A:middle
where you may want to load
plug-ins into your process

00:18:57.836 --> 00:19:00.656 A:middle
if you are a host, because
there is some overhead



00:18:57.836 --> 00:19:00.656 A:middle
if you are a host, because
there is some overhead

00:19:00.766 --> 00:19:03.176 A:middle
to communicating with
that separate extension

00:19:03.176 --> 00:19:04.256 A:middle
service process.

00:19:04.856 --> 00:19:07.056 A:middle
And we have measured that
as being on the order

00:19:07.056 --> 00:19:09.326 A:middle
of 40 seconds microseconds
per render cycle ,

00:19:09.326 --> 00:19:13.146 A:middle
o you can do the math to figure
out how significant that is

00:19:13.146 --> 00:19:14.796 A:middle
in the context of your host.

00:19:15.356 --> 00:19:16.446 A:middle
You have some number

00:19:16.446 --> 00:19:19.526 A:middle
of out-of-process plug-ins you
might be communicating with,

00:19:20.066 --> 00:19:21.676 A:middle
so you have to add that up.

00:19:22.236 --> 00:19:23.626 A:middle
And there is also the factor

00:19:23.626 --> 00:19:26.856 A:middle
of how much audio you are
asking them to render.

00:19:27.656 --> 00:19:30.436 A:middle
For example, if you are
rendering at a very low latency

00:19:30.436 --> 00:19:33.676 A:middle
of 32 frames, that's a 1
millisecond render interval,

00:19:34.016 --> 00:19:37.196 A:middle
so overhead of 40 microseconds
could be significant

00:19:37.196 --> 00:19:38.496 A:middle
at 5.5 percent.

00:19:39.096 --> 00:19:43.226 A:middle
So that's your tradeoff
if you are a host author.

00:19:44.996 --> 00:19:45.896 A:middle
I mentioned earlier

00:19:45.896 --> 00:19:49.486 A:middle
that existing version 2 Audio
Unit hosts need a few changes

00:19:49.856 --> 00:19:52.146 A:middle
to work with version
3 Audio Units,

00:19:52.146 --> 00:19:53.986 A:middle
and here is what has to change.

00:19:55.226 --> 00:19:58.556 A:middle
I mentioned the audio
component description flags,

00:19:59.166 --> 00:20:01.186 A:middle
and in there, the
component flags.



00:19:59.166 --> 00:20:01.186 A:middle
and in there, the
component flags.

00:20:01.186 --> 00:20:04.646 A:middle
There is a new flag called
Requires Async Instantiation.

00:20:05.236 --> 00:20:09.566 A:middle
That's set for most if not
all new version 3 Audio Units,

00:20:10.006 --> 00:20:12.916 A:middle
so if you see that flag set
in the component description,

00:20:12.916 --> 00:20:16.556 A:middle
you have to use the new Audio
Component Instantiate method

00:20:16.936 --> 00:20:19.006 A:middle
instead of Audio
Component Instance New.

00:20:21.026 --> 00:20:23.746 A:middle
Now, similarly in an
existing v ersion 2 host,

00:20:24.386 --> 00:20:27.356 A:middle
if you want to access an
Audio Unit's View Controller,

00:20:28.146 --> 00:20:31.686 A:middle
then you also need to use a new
asynchronous method to do that.

00:20:32.096 --> 00:20:34.806 A:middle
There is a new property,
Request View Controller.

00:20:35.266 --> 00:20:36.546 A:middle
It is also asynchronous.

00:20:36.546 --> 00:20:38.906 A:middle
You can read about
the details of that

00:20:39.116 --> 00:20:41.226 A:middle
in Audio Unit properties.h.

00:20:43.606 --> 00:20:46.186 A:middle
So about these asynchronous
methods.

00:20:46.566 --> 00:20:49.886 A:middle
You can use the new methods
with version 2 units,

00:20:49.996 --> 00:20:53.616 A:middle
but you must use them
with version 3 units

00:20:53.616 --> 00:20:56.196 A:middle
when the flags are set.

00:20:56.196 --> 00:20:58.836 A:middle
And the reasoning here,
well, the big sort

00:20:58.836 --> 00:21:01.926 A:middle
of externally facing reason is
that it helps responsiveness.



00:20:58.836 --> 00:21:01.926 A:middle
of externally facing reason is
that it helps responsiveness.

00:21:02.236 --> 00:21:04.986 A:middle
If it's going to take half
a second to instantiate

00:21:04.986 --> 00:21:08.576 A:middle
that Audio Unit, well, if
you unblock the main thread,

00:21:09.186 --> 00:21:10.986 A:middle
your host applications, meters,

00:21:10.986 --> 00:21:13.306 A:middle
or other animations will
keep drawing smoothly.

00:21:14.446 --> 00:21:16.976 A:middle
Now, especially when
updating existing code --

00:21:16.976 --> 00:21:18.336 A:middle
and this was the
first thing I did

00:21:18.336 --> 00:21:23.506 A:middle
when testing internal test code
-- it's tempting to sit there

00:21:23.506 --> 00:21:24.756 A:middle
and wait on the main thread

00:21:24.756 --> 00:21:27.056 A:middle
for the asynchronous
operation to complete.

00:21:27.736 --> 00:21:31.906 A:middle
Well, don't do that, because not
only will you block any graphics

00:21:31.906 --> 00:21:35.786 A:middle
you are doing, but you will also
block some underlying operations

00:21:35.786 --> 00:21:38.226 A:middle
in the framework that
are actually required

00:21:38.226 --> 00:21:40.956 A:middle
for the Audio Unit
to be instantiated.

00:21:41.376 --> 00:21:43.756 A:middle
So you will deadlock if you
block on the main thread.

00:21:43.966 --> 00:21:47.546 A:middle
Don't do that.

00:21:47.546 --> 00:21:49.476 A:middle
Now, I would like to
switch gears from talking

00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:53.006 A:middle
about hosting Audio Units
to creating Audio Units

00:21:53.006 --> 00:21:54.976 A:middle
with the new version 3 API.

00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:59.776 A:middle
First, a few words
about app extensions

00:21:59.826 --> 00:22:04.246 A:middle
since the new Audio Unit model
is based on app extensions.



00:21:59.826 --> 00:22:04.246 A:middle
since the new Audio Unit model
is based on app extensions.

00:22:05.466 --> 00:22:09.986 A:middle
App extensions are bundles with
a file type extension of .appex.

00:22:10.366 --> 00:22:13.606 A:middle
Xcode will build them into
an app's plug-ins directory,

00:22:14.026 --> 00:22:18.496 A:middle
and we saw how they get
loaded by the system

00:22:18.896 --> 00:22:21.526 A:middle
into separate extension
service processes.

00:22:22.206 --> 00:22:26.326 A:middle
You can read all about the nuts
and bolts of app extensions

00:22:26.586 --> 00:22:28.476 A:middle
in the app extension
programming guide.

00:22:31.206 --> 00:22:35.496 A:middle
Now, our new sample code
project, Audio Unit v3 Example,

00:22:35.956 --> 00:22:39.206 A:middle
contains a sample Audio
Unit implementation called

00:22:39.206 --> 00:22:39.916 A:middle
Filter Demo.

00:22:42.656 --> 00:22:44.106 A:middle
Filter Demo, when you look

00:22:44.106 --> 00:22:46.816 A:middle
at that sample project,
has three targets.

00:22:47.306 --> 00:22:49.316 A:middle
It has what we call
the containing app,

00:22:50.076 --> 00:22:54.556 A:middle
and what it contains is the app
extension as well as a framework

00:22:55.136 --> 00:22:58.506 A:middle
where a lot of its
common code exists.

00:22:58.616 --> 00:23:01.806 A:middle
Both the app and the extension
link against this framework.



00:22:58.616 --> 00:23:01.806 A:middle
Both the app and the extension
link against this framework.

00:23:03.486 --> 00:23:06.756 A:middle
Now, inside this framework,
we have two main classes.

00:23:07.126 --> 00:23:08.866 A:middle
There is AU v3 Filter Demo,

00:23:08.866 --> 00:23:11.436 A:middle
that's the AU Audio
Unit subclass,

00:23:11.706 --> 00:23:13.936 A:middle
and the Filter Demo
View Controller

00:23:14.766 --> 00:23:20.076 A:middle
that controls the custom
view of the Audio Unit.

00:23:20.486 --> 00:23:23.276 A:middle
Now, what's cool about
doing things this way is

00:23:23.336 --> 00:23:26.916 A:middle
that while we are developing our
signal processing and view code,

00:23:27.356 --> 00:23:30.016 A:middle
we can do this all in the
context of our own app

00:23:30.816 --> 00:23:34.676 A:middle
so we are debugging not in a
separate SPC service process,

00:23:35.116 --> 00:23:35.996 A:middle
but we are debugging

00:23:35.996 --> 00:23:38.466 A:middle
and developing our code
right there interactively

00:23:38.726 --> 00:23:39.456 A:middle
in our own app.

00:23:40.536 --> 00:23:43.516 A:middle
We also let our app
look like something

00:23:43.516 --> 00:23:44.666 A:middle
when the user opens it.

00:23:44.666 --> 00:23:46.636 A:middle
It's not just a plug-in
for somebody else.

00:23:47.136 --> 00:23:49.976 A:middle
And we are not duplicating
any code

00:23:49.976 --> 00:23:51.286 A:middle
to be able to accomplish that.

00:23:52.446 --> 00:23:57.246 A:middle
There is one extra bonus here
that on OS X, if we want to,

00:23:57.786 --> 00:24:00.516 A:middle
we can designate this
framework as being the bundle



00:23:57.786 --> 00:24:00.516 A:middle
we can designate this
framework as being the bundle

00:24:00.716 --> 00:24:03.326 A:middle
that a host process
can load into itself.

00:24:03.946 --> 00:24:09.146 A:middle
So let's look at
the app extension.

00:24:09.146 --> 00:24:11.936 A:middle
It has an info plist
with important entries.

00:24:12.336 --> 00:24:15.516 A:middle
The NSExtensionPointIdentifier
tells the system what kind

00:24:15.516 --> 00:24:18.986 A:middle
of extension it is, the main
storyboard tells the system,

00:24:19.396 --> 00:24:22.276 A:middle
when you launch my
extension service process,

00:24:22.716 --> 00:24:23.946 A:middle
open the storyboard.

00:24:25.206 --> 00:24:28.086 A:middle
And finally, there is an
Audio Components array

00:24:28.396 --> 00:24:32.136 A:middle
that tells the system, here are
the audio component descriptions

00:24:32.656 --> 00:24:33.716 A:middle
that I am registering.

00:24:37.306 --> 00:24:40.626 A:middle
Just a quick reminder here, in
your storyboard, you will want

00:24:40.666 --> 00:24:44.506 A:middle
to be sure to specify
your custom class.

00:24:44.666 --> 00:24:47.496 A:middle
You may need to specify the
module if you are building it

00:24:47.496 --> 00:24:49.336 A:middle
into a separate framework
like we are here.

00:24:50.476 --> 00:24:53.326 A:middle
Then the extension actually
has no code in it other

00:24:53.326 --> 00:24:54.676 A:middle
than this little
bit of dummy code

00:24:54.676 --> 00:24:56.186 A:middle
to keep it from being empty.

00:24:56.876 --> 00:24:59.076 A:middle
We have to link against
the Filter Demo framework.

00:24:59.176 --> 00:25:00.366 A:middle
All of the good stuff
is in there,



00:24:59.176 --> 00:25:00.366 A:middle
All of the good stuff
is in there,

00:25:00.906 --> 00:25:05.656 A:middle
and here we just have a global
variable referring to it.

00:25:06.386 --> 00:25:07.936 A:middle
Let's move onto the
framework now.

00:25:09.366 --> 00:25:10.666 A:middle
So the main class

00:25:10.666 --> 00:25:13.306 A:middle
in the framework is the
Filter Demo View Controller.

00:25:13.826 --> 00:25:15.436 A:middle
In extension terminology,

00:25:15.436 --> 00:25:17.316 A:middle
this is the extension's
principal class.

00:25:17.736 --> 00:25:20.526 A:middle
Whenever the extension
is created or loaded,

00:25:20.926 --> 00:25:22.896 A:middle
the system will create
an instance

00:25:22.896 --> 00:25:24.586 A:middle
of that principal class.

00:25:25.136 --> 00:25:26.596 A:middle
And it's got two main jobs.

00:25:26.886 --> 00:25:30.796 A:middle
It in turn creates the AU
Audio Unit subclass and,

00:25:30.876 --> 00:25:33.526 A:middle
as a View Controller as you
would expect, it creates

00:25:33.526 --> 00:25:36.296 A:middle
and manages the plug-ins
custom view.

00:25:38.436 --> 00:25:39.896 A:middle
Here is the class declaration

00:25:39.896 --> 00:25:41.526 A:middle
for the Filter Demo
View Controller.

00:25:42.226 --> 00:25:44.886 A:middle
It derives from AU
View Controller,

00:25:45.566 --> 00:25:48.656 A:middle
which is either an NS or UI
View Controller basically,

00:25:49.386 --> 00:25:52.396 A:middle
and it also implements a
protocol called AU Audio

00:25:52.396 --> 00:25:53.426 A:middle
Unit factory.

00:25:53.916 --> 00:25:57.516 A:middle
That's a simple protocol and
implements exactly one method,

00:25:59.056 --> 00:26:01.236 A:middle
Create Audio Unit with
Component Description.



00:25:59.056 --> 00:26:01.236 A:middle
Create Audio Unit with
Component Description.

00:26:02.546 --> 00:26:04.756 A:middle
And the job of this method is

00:26:04.756 --> 00:26:07.266 A:middle
to create the AU
Audio Unit subclass.

00:26:08.706 --> 00:26:12.466 A:middle
And here it is, the
AU v3 Filter Demo.

00:26:14.606 --> 00:26:17.566 A:middle
Now, let's look at that
AU Audio Unit subclass.

00:26:18.236 --> 00:26:22.486 A:middle
So for reasons we will
get into in a bit,

00:26:22.946 --> 00:26:27.946 A:middle
these are actually embedded
C++ classes or objects.

00:26:28.006 --> 00:26:31.396 A:middle
The filter DSP kernel is
where all of the math happens.

00:26:33.256 --> 00:26:34.186 A:middle
We will listen to it later.

00:26:34.186 --> 00:26:37.836 A:middle
It's a little more interesting
than looking at its code.

00:26:37.936 --> 00:26:42.806 A:middle
We have some code here
dealing with the buses.

00:26:43.136 --> 00:26:43.896 A:middle
This is an effect.

00:26:43.896 --> 00:26:47.656 A:middle
It has one input and one output,
and our base class is going

00:26:47.656 --> 00:26:51.006 A:middle
to want us to provide
arrays of buses

00:26:51.126 --> 00:26:52.736 A:middle
so we have numbers
to support that.

00:26:53.176 --> 00:26:55.446 A:middle
And we have something
called a parameter tree.

00:26:55.516 --> 00:26:57.916 A:middle
We will see what that
is in just a second.

00:26:58.476 --> 00:26:59.496 A:middle
Here is the initializer.



00:27:00.586 --> 00:27:03.196 A:middle
So the first thing we do
is initialize our input

00:27:03.196 --> 00:27:07.606 A:middle
and output buses, and then
we wrap them in bus arrays.

00:27:09.086 --> 00:27:12.136 A:middle
And these arrays each
contain a single bus.

00:27:16.346 --> 00:27:18.346 A:middle
And now we are looking
at parameters.

00:27:18.946 --> 00:27:23.446 A:middle
So every parameter is an object,
and you can think of this object

00:27:23.446 --> 00:27:26.356 A:middle
as kind of the bridge
between your implementation

00:27:26.716 --> 00:27:27.436 A:middle
and the host.

00:27:27.436 --> 00:27:30.516 A:middle
In the middle, there is
the parameter object.

00:27:30.896 --> 00:27:32.486 A:middle
This is a simple
low-pass filter,

00:27:32.486 --> 00:27:34.096 A:middle
so it's only got two parameters,

00:27:34.356 --> 00:27:36.086 A:middle
a cutoff frequency
and residence.

00:27:36.936 --> 00:27:39.146 A:middle
Every parameter has
an identifier,

00:27:39.426 --> 00:27:41.176 A:middle
so here we are saying
it's cutoff.

00:27:41.176 --> 00:27:42.886 A:middle
It has a localizalbe name.

00:27:42.886 --> 00:27:44.806 A:middle
We are being bad and
not localizing it here.

00:27:45.616 --> 00:27:47.006 A:middle
It has an address.

00:27:47.006 --> 00:27:48.326 A:middle
We will talk about
that in a bit.

00:27:48.926 --> 00:27:52.906 A:middle
Arrange, and some units, and
flags which you will recognize

00:27:52.906 --> 00:27:55.066 A:middle
as being almost identical
to what we do

00:27:55.066 --> 00:27:56.596 A:middle
with version 2 Audio Units.

00:27:57.366 --> 00:27:59.366 A:middle
So here we have created
our first parameter.

00:27:59.366 --> 00:28:02.726 A:middle
We will create our second
one almost identically.



00:27:59.366 --> 00:28:02.726 A:middle
We will create our second
one almost identically.

00:28:03.736 --> 00:28:06.656 A:middle
And then finally we can
create our parameter tree,

00:28:07.206 --> 00:28:09.736 A:middle
passing an array of
those two parameters.

00:28:11.126 --> 00:28:14.976 A:middle
Now, we have our parameter tree,
and we want to wire it up so

00:28:14.976 --> 00:28:17.276 A:middle
that it's connected
to our DSP code.

00:28:19.126 --> 00:28:21.536 A:middle
And the way we do this
is install a block

00:28:21.796 --> 00:28:25.556 A:middle
into the parameter tree called
the Implementer Value Observer.

00:28:26.866 --> 00:28:30.276 A:middle
So this block will get
called any time somebody,

00:28:30.276 --> 00:28:33.866 A:middle
whether it's the host or our
own view, changes a parameter,

00:28:34.556 --> 00:28:37.696 A:middle
And so in response to that
change, we will simply set

00:28:37.756 --> 00:28:40.466 A:middle
that new value on
our filter DSP kernel

00:28:40.996 --> 00:28:43.286 A:middle
so that it takes
immediate audible effect.

00:28:45.576 --> 00:28:47.726 A:middle
Now, in the other
direction, there are times

00:28:47.726 --> 00:28:51.536 A:middle
when the tree needs to refresh
its value based on what we have

00:28:51.536 --> 00:28:52.756 A:middle
in our signal processing.

00:28:53.326 --> 00:28:55.066 A:middle
That's what this block does.

00:28:55.636 --> 00:28:59.146 A:middle
It fetches the current
value from the DSP

00:28:59.146 --> 00:29:00.766 A:middle
and returns it to the tree.



00:28:59.146 --> 00:29:00.766 A:middle
and returns it to the tree.

00:29:04.086 --> 00:29:07.066 A:middle
Next, this is an
important override method.

00:29:07.586 --> 00:29:09.926 A:middle
If you're familiar with the
version 2 Audio Unit API,

00:29:10.136 --> 00:29:12.746 A:middle
this was called Audio
Unit Initialize,

00:29:13.866 --> 00:29:17.196 A:middle
which is not a good name choice
in the Objective-C world.

00:29:17.676 --> 00:29:19.996 A:middle
So we decided to make
it very specific.

00:29:20.946 --> 00:29:25.116 A:middle
What was initialize time
is really prepare to render

00:29:25.456 --> 00:29:28.666 A:middle
and allocate the resources that
are associated with rendering.

00:29:29.936 --> 00:29:33.636 A:middle
So there are things like
buffers, DSP state, and so on.

00:29:34.546 --> 00:29:37.636 A:middle
So the first thing we do here
is called the base class method.

00:29:39.126 --> 00:29:42.596 A:middle
Then we can ask our input
bus to allocate some memory

00:29:42.786 --> 00:29:44.646 A:middle
for audio input to the plug-in,

00:29:45.776 --> 00:29:50.806 A:middle
and we can initialize our signal
processing code here based

00:29:50.806 --> 00:29:55.636 A:middle
on the current channel count and
sample rate of the output bus.

00:29:58.456 --> 00:30:01.276 A:middle
So entirely parallel, we
have a method that's called



00:29:58.456 --> 00:30:01.276 A:middle
So entirely parallel, we
have a method that's called

00:30:01.566 --> 00:30:03.496 A:middle
to deallocate render resources.

00:30:03.886 --> 00:30:05.746 A:middle
And here, too, we
call the base class

00:30:06.106 --> 00:30:09.526 A:middle
and basically undo whatever
we did when allocating.

00:30:12.536 --> 00:30:15.886 A:middle
So the process of rendering
works through a block

00:30:16.886 --> 00:30:21.406 A:middle
that gets called every render
cycle, but we are asked

00:30:21.506 --> 00:30:24.436 A:middle
to provide this block
before starting to render.

00:30:25.806 --> 00:30:30.366 A:middle
Here we are going to
capture our C++ members

00:30:30.366 --> 00:30:32.586 A:middle
into local variables
that are pointers.

00:30:33.236 --> 00:30:37.856 A:middle
Now, the reason for this
is that we are going

00:30:38.196 --> 00:30:41.816 A:middle
to be running our block for
rendering in a real-time context

00:30:42.296 --> 00:30:46.136 A:middle
where it's not safe to access
any Objective-C objects

00:30:46.476 --> 00:30:49.296 A:middle
because the runtime could block
and cause an audio glitch.

00:30:50.076 --> 00:30:51.906 A:middle
So, again, we are just going

00:30:51.906 --> 00:30:54.696 A:middle
to capture our C++
member variables.

00:30:57.406 --> 00:30:58.846 A:middle
And then we can return
the block.

00:30:59.936 --> 00:31:02.036 A:middle
It returns AU Audio Unit status.



00:30:59.936 --> 00:31:02.036 A:middle
It returns AU Audio Unit status.

00:31:03.086 --> 00:31:05.436 A:middle
And if you are familiar
with the version 2 API,

00:31:05.606 --> 00:31:07.466 A:middle
the parameters are
largely the same.

00:31:07.846 --> 00:31:10.456 A:middle
There is a time stamp, a
number of sample frames,

00:31:11.016 --> 00:31:12.486 A:middle
an output audio buffer list,

00:31:13.046 --> 00:31:15.906 A:middle
and here is something new called
the real-time event list head.

00:31:16.886 --> 00:31:19.786 A:middle
I will talk about that
in detail, but it relates

00:31:19.786 --> 00:31:22.576 A:middle
to scheduled parameters
and MIDI events.

00:31:25.536 --> 00:31:27.356 A:middle
And finally, the
Pull Input block.

00:31:27.896 --> 00:31:31.076 A:middle
This is how the host
tells us, the implementer

00:31:31.076 --> 00:31:33.926 A:middle
of the Audio Unit,
where to get input from.

00:31:35.596 --> 00:31:37.106 A:middle
So in the guts of
the input block,

00:31:37.416 --> 00:31:40.876 A:middle
the first thing we will do
is pass that Pull Input block

00:31:41.146 --> 00:31:46.096 A:middle
to our input C++ object
and ask that input object

00:31:46.336 --> 00:31:49.476 A:middle
to fetch the audio input
for this render cycle.

00:31:51.056 --> 00:31:53.316 A:middle
Then we are going to do some
housekeeping with buffers.

00:31:53.316 --> 00:31:58.546 A:middle
We will send them down to
the DSP state, and finally,

00:31:59.046 --> 00:32:03.336 A:middle
we ask the DSP state to process
the audio for this render cycle.



00:31:59.046 --> 00:32:03.336 A:middle
we ask the DSP state to process
the audio for this render cycle.

00:32:04.376 --> 00:32:06.806 A:middle
It's already been
informed of the buffers,

00:32:06.896 --> 00:32:09.966 A:middle
and we are just going to give it
a time stamp, the frame count,

00:32:10.176 --> 00:32:12.426 A:middle
and the linked list
of real-time events.

00:32:12.896 --> 00:32:15.636 A:middle
So that's the guts
of this Audio Unit,

00:32:15.636 --> 00:32:16.636 A:middle
there is not a whole
lot of code.

00:32:16.636 --> 00:32:18.006 A:middle
There is a lot more code

00:32:18.006 --> 00:32:19.766 A:middle
that does the actual
signal processing,

00:32:20.366 --> 00:32:23.046 A:middle
but as I mentioned before,
it's better to listen

00:32:23.046 --> 00:32:24.076 A:middle
to that than to look at it.

00:32:24.076 --> 00:32:25.736 A:middle
So I would like to bring
Michael Hopkins back

00:32:25.736 --> 00:32:29.326 A:middle
up to show us the
AU v3 Filter Demo.

00:32:31.316 --> 00:32:32.906 A:middle
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL HOPKINS:
Thank you, Doug.

00:32:33.516 --> 00:32:39.836 A:middle
[Applause]

00:32:40.336 --> 00:32:44.316 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and
start with the app container

00:32:44.316 --> 00:32:46.056 A:middle
that contains the extension.

00:32:46.906 --> 00:32:49.686 A:middle
You will see first on the screen

00:32:49.686 --> 00:32:51.916 A:middle
in the left-hand side
is our Filter Demo,

00:32:52.286 --> 00:32:54.156 A:middle
which we have distributed
as sample code.

00:32:54.676 --> 00:32:58.166 A:middle
To the right of it is the
distortion demo application

00:32:58.166 --> 00:32:59.296 A:middle
that I showed you earlier.

00:32:59.896 --> 00:33:02.026 A:middle
I will go ahead and
launch the Filter Demo.



00:32:59.896 --> 00:33:02.026 A:middle
I will go ahead and
launch the Filter Demo.

00:33:03.236 --> 00:33:04.966 A:middle
Now, at the top of the screen,

00:33:04.966 --> 00:33:06.416 A:middle
you will notice the
two parameters

00:33:06.416 --> 00:33:07.656 A:middle
that Doug talked about.

00:33:08.116 --> 00:33:10.406 A:middle
We have the cutoff in
the residence parameter,

00:33:10.866 --> 00:33:12.766 A:middle
and these are represented
in our UI

00:33:12.766 --> 00:33:14.836 A:middle
with a slider and a text field.

00:33:15.326 --> 00:33:18.406 A:middle
And this portion of the
UI is actually contained

00:33:18.406 --> 00:33:22.686 A:middle
in the application, whereas the
larger area in the main screen

00:33:22.686 --> 00:33:26.146 A:middle
with the graph is
actually our embedded view

00:33:26.546 --> 00:33:28.636 A:middle
from the Audio Unit.

00:33:29.066 --> 00:33:32.816 A:middle
I can go ahead and change
the value of the parameters

00:33:32.816 --> 00:33:34.186 A:middle
by dragging the slider.

00:33:35.006 --> 00:33:38.596 A:middle
And what's happening here is
the application is changing the

00:33:38.596 --> 00:33:39.936 A:middle
value of that parameter.

00:33:40.446 --> 00:33:43.866 A:middle
And the view is listening for
changes to that parameter,

00:33:43.866 --> 00:33:44.866 A:middle
and then it's updating.

00:33:45.586 --> 00:33:47.856 A:middle
As you will see,
that update is live.

00:33:48.536 --> 00:33:50.866 A:middle
Conversely, I can
interact directly

00:33:50.866 --> 00:33:54.386 A:middle
with our embedded Audio
Unit view by tapping

00:33:54.386 --> 00:33:55.726 A:middle
in the graph and dragging.

00:33:56.046 --> 00:33:58.746 A:middle
And you will notice that as
I drag that with my finger,

00:33:58.746 --> 00:34:01.206 A:middle
the application is
receiving notifications



00:33:58.746 --> 00:34:01.206 A:middle
the application is
receiving notifications

00:34:01.206 --> 00:34:04.496 A:middle
that the parameters have changed
and it's updating in turn.

00:34:04.856 --> 00:34:08.396 A:middle
But that's kind of a boring
demo without any audio going

00:34:08.396 --> 00:34:09.286 A:middle
through it, wouldn't you say?

00:34:09.976 --> 00:34:12.286 A:middle
Let's go ahead and
take a listen to that.

00:34:14.516 --> 00:34:29.746 A:middle
[Music]

00:34:30.246 --> 00:34:31.976 A:middle
I could do this all day.

00:34:32.085 --> 00:34:32.735 A:middle
You got time?

00:34:34.996 --> 00:34:40.085 A:middle
Now, it's really, really
cool to just, the fluidity.

00:34:40.545 --> 00:34:41.146 A:middle
Thank you.

00:34:41.255 --> 00:34:44.596 A:middle
Just how fun it is to use your
fingers to just be able to play

00:34:44.596 --> 00:34:45.956 A:middle
with that in a Multi-Touch UI.

00:34:46.446 --> 00:34:47.616 A:middle
It's phenomenal.

00:34:47.696 --> 00:34:51.545 A:middle
Another thing that's
cool about this is

00:34:51.545 --> 00:34:55.766 A:middle
because we have designed the
user interface in such a way

00:34:55.766 --> 00:35:00.006 A:middle
that it can adapt to any
size that it's embedded in,



00:34:55.766 --> 00:35:00.006 A:middle
that it can adapt to any
size that it's embedded in,

00:35:00.466 --> 00:35:04.586 A:middle
we can actually take this iPad
and we can rotate it sideways,

00:35:04.586 --> 00:35:07.616 A:middle
and you can see that now the
user interface is updated.

00:35:07.956 --> 00:35:12.366 A:middle
And from a portrait view to a
landscape view, and vice versa.

00:35:14.566 --> 00:35:17.886 A:middle
Now, we are doing that because
we are supporting Auto Layout

00:35:17.886 --> 00:35:20.866 A:middle
and we are looking at size
classes, so that's really great.

00:35:20.866 --> 00:35:23.806 A:middle
But what happens when we go
and we take this and we put it

00:35:23.806 --> 00:35:26.156 A:middle
into our host app, which
has a much smaller amount

00:35:26.156 --> 00:35:29.236 A:middle
of screen real estate
dedicated to plug-ins?

00:35:30.076 --> 00:35:33.246 A:middle
So I will go ahead and
switch back, and we are going

00:35:33.246 --> 00:35:34.396 A:middle
to open the host there.

00:35:34.536 --> 00:35:37.416 A:middle
I'm going to get rid of the
beautiful distortion demo

00:35:37.516 --> 00:35:40.436 A:middle
and embed our Filter Demo view.

00:35:40.466 --> 00:35:41.846 A:middle
Tap on View to load that.

00:35:42.276 --> 00:35:43.986 A:middle
And now you can see
that that's being loaded

00:35:43.986 --> 00:35:50.096 A:middle
in a constrained vertical space
and a very wide horizontal space

00:35:50.636 --> 00:35:52.586 A:middle
yet it still works
as you would expect,

00:35:52.586 --> 00:35:55.806 A:middle
and none of the labels overlap.

00:35:56.176 --> 00:36:00.606 A:middle
It still works exactly
as we would expect.



00:35:56.176 --> 00:36:00.606 A:middle
It still works exactly
as we would expect.

00:36:02.156 --> 00:36:04.186 A:middle
So this is a fantastic
new technology,

00:36:04.186 --> 00:36:06.926 A:middle
and we are so excited to be able
to finally bring it to you guys

00:36:07.216 --> 00:36:10.996 A:middle
and I can't wait to see what
do in your own iOS apps.

00:36:11.676 --> 00:36:11.976 A:middle
Thank you.

00:36:12.516 --> 00:36:15.616 A:middle
[Applause]

00:36:16.116 --> 00:36:17.356 A:middle
&gt;&gt; DOUG WYATT: Thank
you, Michael.

00:36:18.926 --> 00:36:24.126 A:middle
Just a few words now about
the containing app in general.

00:36:24.746 --> 00:36:27.146 A:middle
It is a vehicle for your
plug-in and helps you

00:36:27.146 --> 00:36:30.826 A:middle
with rapid iteration and
development, but you can think

00:36:30.826 --> 00:36:33.556 A:middle
about putting some extra
things in that containing app.

00:36:34.076 --> 00:36:36.886 A:middle
We saw with the Filter Demo that
it has the simple play engine,

00:36:37.376 --> 00:36:40.526 A:middle
you may for whatever reason
want a more complex play engine

00:36:40.526 --> 00:36:41.146 A:middle
of some sort.

00:36:41.496 --> 00:36:44.396 A:middle
This is also a good
place, the containing app,

00:36:44.466 --> 00:36:47.556 A:middle
to try putting creative
touch controller.

00:36:47.826 --> 00:36:49.736 A:middle
There may not be room
in a plug-in view

00:36:50.036 --> 00:36:51.286 A:middle
for your full touch controller.

00:36:51.356 --> 00:36:54.936 A:middle
Maybe there is, but you might
think about having extra,

00:36:55.336 --> 00:36:56.866 A:middle
an extra-large version
or something

00:36:56.866 --> 00:36:57.906 A:middle
in your containing app.

00:36:58.786 --> 00:37:02.186 A:middle
The app is also a good place
for any documentation or help



00:36:58.786 --> 00:37:02.186 A:middle
The app is also a good place
for any documentation or help

00:37:02.726 --> 00:37:07.466 A:middle
that would make the
plug-in view a little dense.

00:37:08.266 --> 00:37:11.246 A:middle
A few final words about
creating an app extension here.

00:37:11.856 --> 00:37:14.696 A:middle
So if you are going to build
a framework to be loaded

00:37:14.696 --> 00:37:18.926 A:middle
in process on OS X, despite what
we are doing here with Swift,

00:37:19.796 --> 00:37:22.676 A:middle
we can't recommend that
you do this on OS X

00:37:22.676 --> 00:37:26.136 A:middle
because the Swift API
is subject to change.

00:37:26.486 --> 00:37:29.776 A:middle
If you build your plug-in
against one version

00:37:29.776 --> 00:37:32.946 A:middle
of the Swift runtime and you are
loaded into a host that happens

00:37:32.946 --> 00:37:35.736 A:middle
to be using another version,
there could be collisions,

00:37:35.736 --> 00:37:37.716 A:middle
and that would be bad.

00:37:38.536 --> 00:37:43.116 A:middle
We realize when you look at the
sample code here and you try

00:37:43.116 --> 00:37:45.926 A:middle
to build your own plug-ins,
there is a lot, you know,

00:37:45.926 --> 00:37:48.906 A:middle
there is three related targets
that have to be built properly.

00:37:48.906 --> 00:37:50.416 A:middle
It's a little bit complicated.

00:37:50.726 --> 00:37:52.746 A:middle
We do plan in Xcode's template,

00:37:53.166 --> 00:37:56.056 A:middle
but for now you can copy
liberally from the Filter Demo.

00:37:59.026 --> 00:38:02.126 A:middle
Okay. Now I would like
to talk in general



00:37:59.026 --> 00:38:02.126 A:middle
Okay. Now I would like
to talk in general

00:38:02.126 --> 00:38:07.126 A:middle
about the modernized AU Audio
Unit API from both the host

00:38:07.326 --> 00:38:09.556 A:middle
and the implementation sides.

00:38:09.556 --> 00:38:15.556 A:middle
I would like to compare the
way that properties are handled

00:38:15.556 --> 00:38:17.986 A:middle
in version 2 versus version 3.

00:38:18.616 --> 00:38:22.126 A:middle
In version 2 Audio Unit
API, we have scope-

00:38:22.126 --> 00:38:23.716 A:middle
and element-based properties.

00:38:24.196 --> 00:38:26.996 A:middle
A large number of properties
are in the global scope

00:38:26.996 --> 00:38:29.006 A:middle
so you have a bunch of
code where you type.

00:38:29.306 --> 00:38:32.266 A:middle
K Audio Unit scope
global, element 0.

00:38:34.256 --> 00:38:37.146 A:middle
And it's painful,
especially from Swift,

00:38:37.776 --> 00:38:41.376 A:middle
where we have property values
that are void pointers.

00:38:41.916 --> 00:38:44.996 A:middle
You end up typing unsafe mutable
pointer all over the place,

00:38:44.996 --> 00:38:46.566 A:middle
and that makes my head hurt.

00:38:47.316 --> 00:38:50.736 A:middle
We have these functions
with long argument lists.

00:38:52.486 --> 00:38:55.806 A:middle
And by comparison in
the version 3 API, well,

00:38:55.806 --> 00:38:57.116 A:middle
properties are properties.

00:38:57.926 --> 00:39:00.796 A:middle
We use a dot syntax in
Objective-C and Swift,



00:38:57.926 --> 00:39:00.796 A:middle
We use a dot syntax in
Objective-C and Swift,

00:39:00.796 --> 00:39:04.166 A:middle
so you can write
AU.maximum frames to render.

00:39:05.106 --> 00:39:09.656 A:middle
We also implement our
classes to be key-value coding

00:39:09.656 --> 00:39:12.966 A:middle
and key-value observing
compliant so you can use value

00:39:12.966 --> 00:39:15.796 A:middle
for key, and add
observer for key path.

00:39:16.806 --> 00:39:20.306 A:middle
We also added a special KVO
method to the bus array,

00:39:20.656 --> 00:39:23.116 A:middle
add observer to all
buses, so you don't have

00:39:23.116 --> 00:39:27.056 A:middle
to simultaneously be watching
for buses to come and go just

00:39:27.056 --> 00:39:30.076 A:middle
so that you can add
KVO observers on them.

00:39:30.556 --> 00:39:34.176 A:middle
That can be a painful
cycle to chase.

00:39:35.756 --> 00:39:38.626 A:middle
Speaking of buses, they
are full-fledged objects

00:39:38.626 --> 00:39:40.036 A:middle
in the new API.

00:39:40.036 --> 00:39:42.706 A:middle
We have the AU Audio
Unit bus array.

00:39:42.786 --> 00:39:46.186 A:middle
The AU Audio Unit has
an array of input buses,

00:39:46.186 --> 00:39:47.516 A:middle
an array of output buses.

00:39:48.686 --> 00:39:51.296 A:middle
And the buses have
two major properties.

00:39:51.706 --> 00:39:54.016 A:middle
They have a format and a name.

00:39:54.526 --> 00:39:58.286 A:middle
The format is manipulated
by the host.

00:39:58.666 --> 00:40:01.436 A:middle
We are able to reject
formats that we don't like.



00:39:58.666 --> 00:40:01.436 A:middle
We are able to reject
formats that we don't like.

00:40:01.436 --> 00:40:02.786 A:middle
We use the same formats

00:40:02.786 --> 00:40:04.906 A:middle
in version 3 Audio
Units as version 2.

00:40:08.296 --> 00:40:09.486 A:middle
Let's look at parameters.

00:40:09.486 --> 00:40:11.286 A:middle
We have some of the
same problems here

00:40:11.396 --> 00:40:14.116 A:middle
in the version 2
API with parameters

00:40:14.116 --> 00:40:15.346 A:middle
as we did with properties.

00:40:15.836 --> 00:40:18.846 A:middle
We have these unwieldy
scope element ID tuples.

00:40:18.846 --> 00:40:22.886 A:middle
And furthermore, in some very
complex AUs we just didn't have

00:40:22.886 --> 00:40:23.626 A:middle
enough bits.

00:40:24.536 --> 00:40:27.466 A:middle
We have these functions with
long argument lists again,

00:40:27.866 --> 00:40:30.666 A:middle
and we also have a complicated
AU event listener API.

00:40:33.566 --> 00:40:36.506 A:middle
In the version 3 API, I
hinted at this earlier

00:40:38.056 --> 00:40:40.326 A:middle
with the parameter tree
and the Filter Demo.

00:40:40.696 --> 00:40:42.146 A:middle
Well, it is a full tree.

00:40:42.246 --> 00:40:45.776 A:middle
Parameters can be grouped,
and here we have an example

00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:48.576 A:middle
of a simple analog
synthesizer emulation.

00:40:48.916 --> 00:40:51.436 A:middle
It has groups for oscillator,
filter, and amplifier.

00:40:51.916 --> 00:40:55.566 A:middle
The filter and amplifier have
envelope groups beneath them.

00:40:55.866 --> 00:40:58.896 A:middle
And the most brightly
colored boxes beneath are

00:40:58.896 --> 00:40:59.716 A:middle
the parameters.



00:41:00.266 --> 00:41:03.326 A:middle
So the waveform octave,
filter cutoff and resonance,

00:41:03.326 --> 00:41:06.266 A:middle
and the envelope attack,
sustain, and release.

00:41:07.226 --> 00:41:10.606 A:middle
So these boxes are all nodes,
whether they are groups

00:41:10.606 --> 00:41:12.896 A:middle
or parameters, and every node

00:41:12.896 --> 00:41:17.136 A:middle
in the parameter tree has
a unique and permanent ID.

00:41:17.136 --> 00:41:19.816 A:middle
This is like a C identifier.

00:41:21.436 --> 00:41:25.496 A:middle
So using these unique
IDs, we can use KVC to go

00:41:25.496 --> 00:41:27.456 A:middle
and find a parameter
we are looking for,

00:41:27.796 --> 00:41:32.176 A:middle
such as oscillator.wave
or filter.envelope.attack.

00:41:32.586 --> 00:41:34.816 A:middle
And this would be
a lot more flexible

00:41:34.816 --> 00:41:37.096 A:middle
for these very complex
audio units

00:41:37.096 --> 00:41:39.506 A:middle
that have very large
parameter trees.

00:41:40.526 --> 00:41:41.626 A:middle
Now, you will notice

00:41:41.676 --> 00:41:44.146 A:middle
that parameters have
numeric addresses

00:41:44.266 --> 00:41:48.296 A:middle
and that they are 64 bits,
but we do have to treat them

00:41:48.296 --> 00:41:53.306 A:middle
as transient in any situation
where we aren't the one who made

00:41:53.306 --> 00:41:54.586 A:middle
up that addressing scheme.

00:41:56.946 --> 00:42:00.156 A:middle
So that means if I'm a
host application and I want



00:41:56.946 --> 00:42:00.156 A:middle
So that means if I'm a
host application and I want

00:42:00.156 --> 00:42:03.196 A:middle
to record some parameter
automation, I should record

00:42:03.196 --> 00:42:06.556 A:middle
that automation using
the key value path --

00:42:07.106 --> 00:42:10.656 A:middle
I'm sorry, the key path of that
parameter and not its address.

00:42:11.236 --> 00:42:15.086 A:middle
I alluded to this earlier.

00:42:15.796 --> 00:42:20.256 A:middle
The AU parameter object is
the focus of communication

00:42:20.326 --> 00:42:24.116 A:middle
for parameter values
between hosts and views,

00:42:24.416 --> 00:42:27.166 A:middle
and on the other side, the
Audio Unit implementations.

00:42:29.766 --> 00:42:31.866 A:middle
Now, from the host's
point of view,

00:42:32.176 --> 00:42:36.306 A:middle
the parameter object has
properties like its value,

00:42:36.306 --> 00:42:38.686 A:middle
also a minimum and
maximum value, and so on.

00:42:39.476 --> 00:42:44.126 A:middle
So we can set and get parameter
values using dot notation

00:42:44.126 --> 00:42:44.926 A:middle
as you would expect.

00:42:45.836 --> 00:42:48.366 A:middle
Now, we can also set
values in such a way

00:42:48.366 --> 00:42:52.416 A:middle
to prevent a feedback
loop, which is useful both

00:42:52.446 --> 00:42:56.256 A:middle
for performance and for
keeping the UI smooth.

00:42:56.396 --> 00:42:58.536 A:middle
We don't want to be
getting notifications

00:42:58.536 --> 00:42:59.556 A:middle
that are slightly different

00:42:59.626 --> 00:43:02.196 A:middle
from what we are doing
as we move a slider.



00:42:59.626 --> 00:43:02.196 A:middle
from what we are doing
as we move a slider.

00:43:02.646 --> 00:43:06.486 A:middle
So the set value method
accomplishes that.

00:43:07.396 --> 00:43:12.686 A:middle
And that token is obtained from
a method to add an observer

00:43:12.686 --> 00:43:15.856 A:middle
to a parameter, or its tree,
or a group in the tree.

00:43:16.866 --> 00:43:19.056 A:middle
And when we do that, then
we can get called back

00:43:19.056 --> 00:43:19.936 A:middle
from the parameter.

00:43:19.936 --> 00:43:21.326 A:middle
That's what we see
at the bottom there.

00:43:21.836 --> 00:43:24.386 A:middle
There is the block called
the AU parameter observer,

00:43:24.866 --> 00:43:27.996 A:middle
and it passes us the
address and the new value

00:43:27.996 --> 00:43:29.316 A:middle
of the parameter that changed.

00:43:29.876 --> 00:43:35.586 A:middle
As for the implementation, we
saw this in the Filter Demo.

00:43:36.046 --> 00:43:38.176 A:middle
It has the implementer
value observer

00:43:38.416 --> 00:43:40.106 A:middle
and value provider blocks.

00:43:40.736 --> 00:43:42.256 A:middle
Now, in Filter Demo,

00:43:42.256 --> 00:43:44.356 A:middle
it installed these
blocks on the tree.

00:43:44.516 --> 00:43:48.046 A:middle
It's also possible to install
them at any level of the tree,

00:43:48.466 --> 00:43:50.096 A:middle
even on individual parameters.

00:43:50.926 --> 00:43:56.776 A:middle
I would also like to show
off what we have done

00:43:56.776 --> 00:43:57.996 A:middle
with parameter scheduling

00:43:57.996 --> 00:43:59.816 A:middle
because I think this
is a big improvement



00:44:00.186 --> 00:44:02.346 A:middle
over the version 2
API in this area.

00:44:03.726 --> 00:44:06.696 A:middle
We have the host and the
implementation dealing

00:44:06.696 --> 00:44:08.226 A:middle
with things somewhat separately,

00:44:08.776 --> 00:44:13.406 A:middle
but here we have the AU Audio
Unit base class doing some help,

00:44:13.486 --> 00:44:15.246 A:middle
it's helping us implement this.

00:44:15.536 --> 00:44:20.456 A:middle
So the host can obtain from the
AU Audio Unit a block called the

00:44:20.456 --> 00:44:21.776 A:middle
schedule parameter block.

00:44:22.496 --> 00:44:26.696 A:middle
And at render time, it can call
this block to change parameters

00:44:26.736 --> 00:44:28.786 A:middle
in sample-accurate way.

00:44:29.856 --> 00:44:32.726 A:middle
So the first argument to do
schedule is a sample time,

00:44:33.446 --> 00:44:35.556 A:middle
the parameter value
can ramp over time

00:44:35.556 --> 00:44:38.756 A:middle
if the Audio Unit has
advertised it as being rampable.

00:44:39.346 --> 00:44:43.516 A:middle
For example, the
Apple Mixer does this.

00:44:44.266 --> 00:44:46.436 A:middle
And the last two
parameters, of course,

00:44:46.846 --> 00:44:50.066 A:middle
are function parameters -- are
the address of the parameter

00:44:50.066 --> 00:44:52.656 A:middle
to be changed and the
new parameter value.

00:44:54.226 --> 00:44:55.706 A:middle
Now, things are a
little bit different

00:44:55.706 --> 00:44:57.066 A:middle
on the implementation side.

00:44:57.066 --> 00:45:00.096 A:middle
We don't just get a
pass-through call from the host.



00:44:57.066 --> 00:45:00.096 A:middle
We don't just get a
pass-through call from the host.

00:45:00.946 --> 00:45:03.196 A:middle
Instead, the base class is going

00:45:03.196 --> 00:45:05.546 A:middle
to fetch the internal
render block, which we saw

00:45:05.546 --> 00:45:08.516 A:middle
in the Filter Demo,
and it's going to pass

00:45:08.566 --> 00:45:11.516 A:middle
that render block
the real-time events

00:45:12.166 --> 00:45:14.796 A:middle
that pertain only to
that render cycle.

00:45:15.136 --> 00:45:19.086 A:middle
So the base class is maintaining
the full schedule of all

00:45:19.086 --> 00:45:21.866 A:middle
of the pending scheduled
parameter changes

00:45:22.236 --> 00:45:25.146 A:middle
and just parceling out
the relevant pieces of it

00:45:25.146 --> 00:45:27.496 A:middle
to the Audio Unit
at rendering time.

00:45:29.886 --> 00:45:31.376 A:middle
So that's parameter scheduling,

00:45:31.376 --> 00:45:34.186 A:middle
and we have done the exact
same thing with MIDI events.

00:45:35.086 --> 00:45:36.416 A:middle
The host fetches a block

00:45:36.926 --> 00:45:39.166 A:middle
from the Audio Unit
before starting to render.

00:45:40.006 --> 00:45:42.496 A:middle
It calls that block
at render time.

00:45:43.376 --> 00:45:47.466 A:middle
Now, you will notice here we
have added a function argument

00:45:47.506 --> 00:45:50.286 A:middle
called cable where,

00:45:50.286 --> 00:45:54.036 A:middle
in the version 2 Audio Unit API
there is only one MIDI cable

00:45:54.036 --> 00:45:59.076 A:middle
with 16 channels, now we
have 256 virtual MIDI cables.

00:45:59.536 --> 00:46:00.816 A:middle
So if you have an Audio Unit



00:45:59.536 --> 00:46:00.816 A:middle
So if you have an Audio Unit

00:46:01.386 --> 00:46:04.476 A:middle
that wants huge sample
banks, you can do that.

00:46:04.476 --> 00:46:07.346 A:middle
You can address them all
on virtual MIDI cables.

00:46:09.186 --> 00:46:11.226 A:middle
On the implementation
side for MIDI events,

00:46:11.276 --> 00:46:14.346 A:middle
this is exactly the same as
for scheduled parameters.

00:46:15.126 --> 00:46:19.006 A:middle
The base class AU Audio Unit is
maintaining internal schedule

00:46:19.806 --> 00:46:23.076 A:middle
and passing events to
the internal render block

00:46:23.606 --> 00:46:28.246 A:middle
through the real-time event list
only during the render cycle

00:46:28.246 --> 00:46:30.196 A:middle
during which they are
supposed to take effect.

00:46:32.016 --> 00:46:34.836 A:middle
So we think this is
a big improvement.

00:46:34.836 --> 00:46:36.596 A:middle
It saves the implementer
a lot of work.

00:46:39.086 --> 00:46:43.456 A:middle
Now, about rendering in general,
we are still using a pull model,

00:46:43.456 --> 00:46:47.826 A:middle
meaning that an output unit
pulls a mixer, pulls an effect,

00:46:47.996 --> 00:46:49.746 A:middle
pulls another effect,
pulls the player.

00:46:49.746 --> 00:46:51.776 A:middle
Audio flows back down
through the chain.

00:46:52.736 --> 00:46:55.236 A:middle
One difference here is
in the version 2 API,

00:46:55.236 --> 00:46:58.206 A:middle
the Audio Unit needs
to maintain some state.

00:46:58.206 --> 00:47:02.426 A:middle
It needs to have a notion of
whether it's getting its input



00:46:58.206 --> 00:47:02.426 A:middle
It needs to have a notion of
whether it's getting its input

00:47:02.426 --> 00:47:05.976 A:middle
from another Audio Unit
upstream or a function callback.

00:47:06.606 --> 00:47:09.776 A:middle
Now, in the version 3
API, it's much simpler,

00:47:09.776 --> 00:47:12.436 A:middle
the AU doesn't have to
maintain that state.

00:47:12.916 --> 00:47:15.306 A:middle
This callback, as we
saw in the Filter Demo,

00:47:15.736 --> 00:47:19.216 A:middle
comes from the host, and
it is passed during every

00:47:19.216 --> 00:47:20.026 A:middle
render cycle.

00:47:21.536 --> 00:47:24.936 A:middle
But otherwise, the APIs are
pretty much functionally

00:47:24.936 --> 00:47:28.126 A:middle
identical, and this lets
us bridge very efficiently

00:47:28.126 --> 00:47:28.776 A:middle
between them.

00:47:32.586 --> 00:47:37.396 A:middle
Now, if your host is calling AU
Audio Unit directly to render

00:47:37.706 --> 00:47:40.656 A:middle
as opposed to using AU
graph or AVAudioEngine,

00:47:41.616 --> 00:47:45.906 A:middle
here you will want to call
allocate render resources

00:47:45.906 --> 00:47:49.066 A:middle
as usual and then hold
onto the render block.

00:47:50.076 --> 00:47:51.656 A:middle
You can call the
render block to render.

00:47:52.496 --> 00:47:54.876 A:middle
It looks very similar to
the internal render block.

00:47:55.716 --> 00:47:59.656 A:middle
It's worth reviewing
here some rules

00:47:59.656 --> 00:48:03.296 A:middle
about the audio buffer lists
that appear at render time.



00:47:59.656 --> 00:48:03.296 A:middle
about the audio buffer lists
that appear at render time.

00:48:03.946 --> 00:48:06.826 A:middle
Now, the host provides an
output audio buffer list,

00:48:07.366 --> 00:48:11.296 A:middle
and in that audio buffer list
the M data pointer can be null.

00:48:12.286 --> 00:48:15.696 A:middle
The Audio Unit must replace this
with an internally owned buffer

00:48:15.876 --> 00:48:19.516 A:middle
and at the same time,
the AU has to promise

00:48:19.566 --> 00:48:21.346 A:middle
that that buffer
will remain valid

00:48:21.346 --> 00:48:22.706 A:middle
until the next render cycle.

00:48:23.266 --> 00:48:25.066 A:middle
This is all, by the
way, exactly the same

00:48:25.066 --> 00:48:27.856 A:middle
as with version 2 Audio Units,
I'm just reemphasizing it

00:48:28.496 --> 00:48:29.406 A:middle
because it's important.

00:48:31.456 --> 00:48:35.816 A:middle
Now, in the render block, we
have some rules, similar rules

00:48:35.816 --> 00:48:37.706 A:middle
but not the same,
about input buffers.

00:48:38.146 --> 00:48:41.256 A:middle
The host provides that
input block, the AU calls it

00:48:41.256 --> 00:48:45.116 A:middle
for input, and when the AU
calls that block for input,

00:48:45.526 --> 00:48:48.456 A:middle
it has to supply valid
audio buffer lists

00:48:48.646 --> 00:48:52.016 A:middle
with non-null M data
pointers to that block.

00:48:52.846 --> 00:48:56.966 A:middle
Now, the host is allowed to
replace those pointers to memory

00:48:56.966 --> 00:49:00.736 A:middle
that it owns and can
promise to keep valid



00:48:56.966 --> 00:49:00.736 A:middle
that it owns and can
promise to keep valid

00:49:00.736 --> 00:49:04.476 A:middle
until the next render cycle or
deallocate render resources,

00:49:05.166 --> 00:49:08.446 A:middle
and all of this accomplishes
an important goal,

00:49:08.446 --> 00:49:11.266 A:middle
which is to absolutely
minimize copying.

00:49:12.076 --> 00:49:17.526 A:middle
Okay. Here is the scary
slide for those of you

00:49:18.596 --> 00:49:23.276 A:middle
who are writing code to
run in rendering context.

00:49:23.696 --> 00:49:26.786 A:middle
So audio rendering
almost always happens

00:49:26.786 --> 00:49:28.656 A:middle
in a real-time thread context.

00:49:28.966 --> 00:49:30.956 A:middle
And this is a restrictive
environment

00:49:31.096 --> 00:49:32.966 A:middle
because we can't
allocate memory,

00:49:33.546 --> 00:49:36.386 A:middle
which means that we really
shouldn't even be calling

00:49:36.386 --> 00:49:38.066 A:middle
dispatch async, for instance.

00:49:38.346 --> 00:49:42.046 A:middle
And in fact we can't make any
call at all which might block,

00:49:42.636 --> 00:49:47.046 A:middle
for example, taking a mutex
or waiting on a semaphore.

00:49:47.436 --> 00:49:51.846 A:middle
The reason is if we do block and
we block for any length of time,

00:49:52.276 --> 00:49:53.866 A:middle
then the audio rendering thread

00:49:53.866 --> 00:49:55.686 A:middle
in the system will
miss its deadline,

00:49:56.186 --> 00:49:59.316 A:middle
and the user will
experience that as a glitch.



00:50:00.526 --> 00:50:05.426 A:middle
So we have to be very careful
when both using and calling or,

00:50:05.426 --> 00:50:06.316 A:middle
I'm sorry, both using

00:50:06.316 --> 00:50:08.536 A:middle
and implementing
these render blocks.

00:50:10.286 --> 00:50:14.096 A:middle
So you will see in the Filter
Demo how we went to some lengths

00:50:14.266 --> 00:50:17.366 A:middle
to not capture our Self object

00:50:17.366 --> 00:50:20.256 A:middle
or any other Objective-C
object for that matter.

00:50:21.276 --> 00:50:24.346 A:middle
In that block, we avoid
the Objective-C runtime

00:50:24.346 --> 00:50:27.716 A:middle
because it's inherently unsafe.

00:50:27.716 --> 00:50:28.756 A:middle
It can take blocks.

00:50:29.426 --> 00:50:31.756 A:middle
Unfortunately, the Swift
run-time is exactly the

00:50:31.756 --> 00:50:31.936 A:middle
same way.

00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:37.556 A:middle
So this is why in the Filter
Demo you'll see we have C++

00:50:37.556 --> 00:50:41.776 A:middle
objects and we capture
pointers to those C++ objects.

00:50:42.246 --> 00:50:44.106 A:middle
Now, if you are allergic
to C++, you are free

00:50:44.106 --> 00:50:47.026 A:middle
to do the same thing
in plain vanilla C,

00:50:47.026 --> 00:50:51.276 A:middle
although I'm not sure why
you would want to do that.

00:50:51.276 --> 00:50:52.276 A:middle
Enough scary stuff.

00:50:52.276 --> 00:50:54.046 A:middle
I would like to bring
up Alec Little now

00:50:54.156 --> 00:50:57.926 A:middle
to show Audio Unit extensions
in Apple Music creation apps.

00:50:58.516 --> 00:51:03.916 A:middle
[Applause]



00:50:58.516 --> 00:51:03.916 A:middle
[Applause]

00:51:04.416 --> 00:51:04.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; ALEC LITTLE: Thanks, Doug.

00:51:05.106 --> 00:51:09.446 A:middle
I'm Alec. I work on the music
creation applications for Apple,

00:51:09.446 --> 00:51:10.846 A:middle
things like GarageBand
and Logic.

00:51:11.276 --> 00:51:14.826 A:middle
We are excited about the
new Audio Unit extensions.

00:51:14.826 --> 00:51:18.086 A:middle
We think they will add real
power and creative possibilities

00:51:18.086 --> 00:51:19.836 A:middle
for developers and users.

00:51:19.836 --> 00:51:21.556 A:middle
So I wanted to talk a little bit

00:51:21.556 --> 00:51:23.566 A:middle
about what some of
our plans are.

00:51:23.666 --> 00:51:25.396 A:middle
So first of all, we plan

00:51:25.396 --> 00:51:27.586 A:middle
to support the Audio Unit
extension, of course,

00:51:27.586 --> 00:51:29.686 A:middle
in all of our main applications.

00:51:29.686 --> 00:51:34.466 A:middle
So that's GarageBand iOS,
GarageBand Mac, Logic Pro X,

00:51:34.466 --> 00:51:35.906 A:middle
Logic Pro 10, and Mainstage.

00:51:37.326 --> 00:51:42.836 A:middle
So what I thought we would do
today is look at some examples,

00:51:42.836 --> 00:51:46.286 A:middle
some pretty pictures, if you
will, from GarageBand iOS.

00:51:46.286 --> 00:51:47.966 A:middle
And this is just
preliminary stuff,

00:51:47.966 --> 00:51:49.616 A:middle
but I think it will
give you an idea of kind

00:51:49.616 --> 00:51:51.976 A:middle
of what we are planning
to do as a host

00:51:52.286 --> 00:51:53.786 A:middle
to support Audio
Unit extensions.

00:51:55.136 --> 00:51:58.926 A:middle
So first of all, we are going
to be supporting AU instruments.

00:51:59.206 --> 00:52:02.126 A:middle
So the example I'm going to be
giving is about how we're going



00:51:59.206 --> 00:52:02.126 A:middle
So the example I'm going to be
giving is about how we're going

00:52:02.126 --> 00:52:03.626 A:middle
to implement those
AU instruments.

00:52:04.796 --> 00:52:07.136 A:middle
So first of all, just a
little graphic to explain

00:52:07.136 --> 00:52:08.936 A:middle
about what we are going to
do, something simple here,

00:52:08.936 --> 00:52:10.786 A:middle
but GarageBand is
going to request

00:52:10.786 --> 00:52:14.756 A:middle
from the View Controller
a custom UI dimension

00:52:14.756 --> 00:52:15.976 A:middle
that we will talk
about in a second.

00:52:16.556 --> 00:52:18.526 A:middle
Pass MIDI events over to
the Audio Unit and then

00:52:18.526 --> 00:52:22.316 A:middle
of course receive audio
back over the audio bus.

00:52:22.876 --> 00:52:26.276 A:middle
On to the promised pictures.

00:52:27.236 --> 00:52:31.286 A:middle
So GarageBand, our main
launch screen launches

00:52:31.286 --> 00:52:35.836 A:middle
into what we call our
touch instrument carousel.

00:52:35.836 --> 00:52:38.556 A:middle
We have all of our touch
instruments here: keyboards,

00:52:38.556 --> 00:52:40.936 A:middle
drums, smart guitars,
all of those things.

00:52:41.966 --> 00:52:44.956 A:middle
Then if you see on the left
there is this container,

00:52:44.956 --> 00:52:47.426 A:middle
and if GarageBand is seeing

00:52:47.426 --> 00:52:49.556 A:middle
that there are Audio Unit
instruments installed

00:52:49.556 --> 00:52:51.596 A:middle
on the device, we will
show that container.

00:52:51.596 --> 00:52:53.686 A:middle
I can swipe over
to that container,

00:52:54.276 --> 00:52:55.826 A:middle
and that's where my
Audio Units live.

00:52:55.826 --> 00:53:00.786 A:middle
If I tap on it, then
we will see all



00:52:55.826 --> 00:53:00.786 A:middle
If I tap on it, then
we will see all

00:53:00.786 --> 00:53:04.656 A:middle
of the Audio Unit instruments
installed on the device.

00:53:04.656 --> 00:53:07.066 A:middle
Now, if I tap on one
of those instruments,

00:53:07.826 --> 00:53:10.196 A:middle
we will show a big gray
box and a keyboard -- no.

00:53:10.706 --> 00:53:13.876 A:middle
We will show your
custom UI up there

00:53:14.336 --> 00:53:17.416 A:middle
in that nice embedded
view inside GarageBand,

00:53:17.416 --> 00:53:19.546 A:middle
and I think that's the coolest
part of this whole thing is

00:53:19.586 --> 00:53:22.596 A:middle
that we get to show
the actual identity

00:53:22.596 --> 00:53:25.606 A:middle
of your Audio Unit
inside our host there.

00:53:25.606 --> 00:53:28.846 A:middle
And we will be providing our
standard GarageBand keyboard

00:53:28.846 --> 00:53:30.966 A:middle
for you to be able to play that.

00:53:31.416 --> 00:53:35.326 A:middle
We will be recording the MIDI
and receiving the audio back.

00:53:35.466 --> 00:53:38.926 A:middle
So that just kind of brings
up a pretty obvious point.

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:41.516 A:middle
When you are providing
these custom UIs,

00:53:41.516 --> 00:53:44.936 A:middle
make sure you are not putting
any sort of custom, you know,

00:53:45.086 --> 00:53:47.136 A:middle
MIDI controller-type
device there

00:53:47.136 --> 00:53:49.426 A:middle
because we won't be capturing
your MIDI in GarageBand.

00:53:51.236 --> 00:53:54.456 A:middle
Just a quick look what we
plan to do on the phone.

00:53:55.406 --> 00:53:59.196 A:middle
Is, again, we have a lot more
limited screen real estate

00:53:59.196 --> 00:54:01.646 A:middle
there, so there is a button
in the top-right corner,



00:53:59.196 --> 00:54:01.646 A:middle
there, so there is a button
in the top-right corner,

00:54:01.736 --> 00:54:03.326 A:middle
which pulls up the
controls view,

00:54:04.056 --> 00:54:06.096 A:middle
and there is the custom UI.

00:54:06.416 --> 00:54:08.586 A:middle
So all of the control there,
and a little bit of room

00:54:08.586 --> 00:54:10.856 A:middle
for the user to still play on
the keyboard down at the bottom.

00:54:10.986 --> 00:54:14.746 A:middle
So here is the most important
slide probably from me today,

00:54:14.746 --> 00:54:17.656 A:middle
and this is the dimensions
we will be requesting

00:54:17.876 --> 00:54:19.986 A:middle
from the View Controller.

00:54:20.806 --> 00:54:23.806 A:middle
So you want to have your
stuff look good in GarageBand,

00:54:24.306 --> 00:54:25.666 A:middle
pay attention to
those dimensions,

00:54:25.666 --> 00:54:29.726 A:middle
and we will do something
pretty cool together.

00:54:30.376 --> 00:54:32.936 A:middle
So, again, we think it's going
to be really exciting to be able

00:54:32.936 --> 00:54:35.636 A:middle
to see and have the
users be able to play

00:54:35.636 --> 00:54:37.556 A:middle
with the actual interface

00:54:37.556 --> 00:54:39.936 A:middle
of your Audio Units
right inside GarageBand,

00:54:39.936 --> 00:54:42.316 A:middle
and we are really excited to
work with you guys to come

00:54:42.316 --> 00:54:43.246 A:middle
up with really cool stuff!

00:54:44.516 --> 00:54:51.816 A:middle
[Applause]

00:54:52.316 --> 00:54:52.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; DOUG WYATT: Thanks, Alec.

00:54:54.416 --> 00:54:57.516 A:middle
So I imagine you may have
questions at this point.

00:54:57.966 --> 00:55:01.306 A:middle
I would like to try to
anticipate a few of them.



00:54:57.966 --> 00:55:01.306 A:middle
I would like to try to
anticipate a few of them.

00:55:01.956 --> 00:55:04.836 A:middle
What about inter-app
audio on iOS?

00:55:05.656 --> 00:55:07.226 A:middle
This is a couple
of years old now.

00:55:08.236 --> 00:55:10.596 A:middle
And there is a number of
apps that have supported it.

00:55:11.116 --> 00:55:13.876 A:middle
Well, from our point of view,
this uses a small subset

00:55:13.876 --> 00:55:17.406 A:middle
of the version 2 API, and it
doesn't support a bunch of thing

00:55:17.406 --> 00:55:18.746 A:middle
that people have asked us for,

00:55:18.746 --> 00:55:21.446 A:middle
like parameter support,
presets, and so on.

00:55:22.096 --> 00:55:25.106 A:middle
And we get these requests
and I think, well,

00:55:25.106 --> 00:55:26.976 A:middle
we should have a
full plug-in model,

00:55:27.386 --> 00:55:29.606 A:middle
which is what we have now.

00:55:29.816 --> 00:55:32.296 A:middle
So while we are not
deprecating inter-app audio,

00:55:32.296 --> 00:55:36.436 A:middle
we do see the way forward to add
all of these missing features is

00:55:36.436 --> 00:55:38.746 A:middle
through Audio Unit extensions.

00:55:39.466 --> 00:55:43.206 A:middle
Now on OS X, you
may be wondering

00:55:43.206 --> 00:55:44.996 A:middle
about the compatibility story

00:55:45.356 --> 00:55:47.546 A:middle
if you have existing
hosts and Audio Units.

00:55:48.256 --> 00:55:51.156 A:middle
The bridges should save
you from a lot of pain.

00:55:51.156 --> 00:55:54.066 A:middle
They are compatible, and we
have gone to a lot of work

00:55:54.256 --> 00:55:57.406 A:middle
to make things work
as well as we can.

00:55:58.096 --> 00:56:01.726 A:middle
So I would recommend that you
update to version 3 when you can



00:55:58.096 --> 00:56:01.726 A:middle
So I would recommend that you
update to version 3 when you can

00:56:01.906 --> 00:56:03.846 A:middle
or need to for some feature.

00:56:03.846 --> 00:56:06.746 A:middle
Maybe you want to redo the
way you handle MIDI events

00:56:06.746 --> 00:56:08.456 A:middle
or scheduled parameters,
for example.

00:56:09.736 --> 00:56:12.316 A:middle
We do have a shortcut
for porting.

00:56:12.316 --> 00:56:15.056 A:middle
It's called AU Audio
Unit v2 Bridge.

00:56:15.056 --> 00:56:18.546 A:middle
This is an AU Audio Unit
subclass that is implemented

00:56:18.546 --> 00:56:21.876 A:middle
on top of a version 2 AU, so you
might be able to start with that

00:56:21.916 --> 00:56:25.736 A:middle
and evolve to a more fully
native implementation.

00:56:26.326 --> 00:56:30.356 A:middle
And as Michael mentioned
earlier,

00:56:31.216 --> 00:56:34.176 A:middle
version 3 Audio Units are
largely cross-platform

00:56:34.176 --> 00:56:36.536 A:middle
between iOS and OS X.

00:56:36.716 --> 00:56:38.076 A:middle
The signal processing code

00:56:38.076 --> 00:56:41.556 A:middle
in AU Audio Unit should be
absolutely fully portable

00:56:41.556 --> 00:56:43.786 A:middle
because there are no
UI implementations,

00:56:44.216 --> 00:56:45.526 A:middle
or dependencies, rather.

00:56:46.196 --> 00:56:51.136 A:middle
AU View Controller derives from
either UI or NSViewController

00:56:51.136 --> 00:56:54.126 A:middle
so you get a little bit of
insulation, but you will

00:56:54.126 --> 00:56:56.126 A:middle
at some point run into
platform-specific UI.

00:56:56.126 --> 00:57:00.576 A:middle
We are running out of
time, and there is way more



00:56:56.126 --> 00:57:00.576 A:middle
We are running out of
time, and there is way more

00:57:00.576 --> 00:57:03.406 A:middle
than I could possibly go
through in an hour here.

00:57:03.546 --> 00:57:06.876 A:middle
At this point I would like to
refer you to your header files

00:57:06.876 --> 00:57:08.856 A:middle
in the Audio Unit framework.

00:57:09.006 --> 00:57:13.216 A:middle
You do need to link AudioToolbox
for historical reasons.

00:57:13.556 --> 00:57:16.806 A:middle
The main header file is AU Audio
Unit.h but there are others,

00:57:17.306 --> 00:57:20.356 A:middle
AU View Controllers in the
Core Audio kit framework,

00:57:20.906 --> 00:57:24.436 A:middle
and as we mentioned, there
is the AVFoundation framework

00:57:24.436 --> 00:57:28.796 A:middle
with AU Audio Unit component.h.
We have good HeaderDoc in all

00:57:28.796 --> 00:57:32.276 A:middle
of these, so I would like to
urge you to check them out.

00:57:34.376 --> 00:57:38.216 A:middle
Finally, if you would like to
use our Audio Unit's logo --

00:57:38.306 --> 00:57:39.546 A:middle
there is a white version, too --

00:57:39.546 --> 00:57:43.266 A:middle
you can go check out
this link for a license.

00:57:44.616 --> 00:57:46.086 A:middle
And that brings us to the end.

00:57:46.466 --> 00:57:48.426 A:middle
So we have seen how we now have

00:57:48.426 --> 00:57:52.736 A:middle
for the first time a full
plug-in model for audio on iOS,

00:57:52.866 --> 00:57:54.356 A:middle
and it's the same on OS X.

00:57:55.056 --> 00:57:58.446 A:middle
And, again, it lets you sell
Audio Units in both the iOS

00:57:58.666 --> 00:58:02.566 A:middle
and OS X App Stores by
packaging your Audio Units



00:57:58.666 --> 00:58:02.566 A:middle
and OS X App Stores by
packaging your Audio Units

00:58:02.566 --> 00:58:03.716 A:middle
as app extensions.

00:58:04.606 --> 00:58:08.416 A:middle
We looked at the simple host
applications that are possible

00:58:08.416 --> 00:58:12.316 A:middle
with AVAudioEngine, and that's
illustrated in our new sample,

00:58:12.706 --> 00:58:14.126 A:middle
Audio Unit v3 Example.

00:58:14.876 --> 00:58:17.346 A:middle
So I would like to encourage
you to write bugs as you work

00:58:17.346 --> 00:58:19.526 A:middle
through the sample code,
read the documentation,

00:58:20.036 --> 00:58:23.156 A:middle
and work on the great AU hosts

00:58:23.156 --> 00:58:25.616 A:middle
and implementations
that I know you will.

00:58:26.236 --> 00:58:34.026 A:middle
So for more information, this
was our session yesterday,

00:58:34.756 --> 00:58:35.676 A:middle
so thank you very much!

00:58:36.516 --> 00:58:39.500 A:middle
[Applause]
