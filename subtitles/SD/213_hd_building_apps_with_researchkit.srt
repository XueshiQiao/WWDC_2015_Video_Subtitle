00:00:25.516 --> 00:00:30.236 A:middle
[Applause]

00:00:30.736 --> 00:00:31.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JOHN EARL: Hello.

00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:33.676 A:middle
My name is John Earl,
and I'm an engineer

00:00:33.676 --> 00:00:34.616 A:middle
on the ResearchKit team.

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:37.976 A:middle
Today I will be talking about
ResearchKit and about building

00:00:37.976 --> 00:00:39.786 A:middle
and contributing
to research apps.

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:42.346 A:middle
So our agenda today
has four parts.

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:46.276 A:middle
First, we will cover
what ResearchKit is.

00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.266 A:middle
Then, I will cover a few issues

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.986 A:middle
that may affect the design the
design of your app-based study.

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:56.736 A:middle
The meat of the talk though will
be when I cover building apps

00:00:56.736 --> 00:00:58.906 A:middle
with ResearchKit, how
ResearchKit can help you

00:00:59.006 --> 00:00:59.876 A:middle
to build research apps.



00:01:00.336 --> 00:01:03.746 A:middle
And finally, since it's
an open source project,

00:01:03.746 --> 00:01:06.366 A:middle
I will talk about how you can
contribute to ResearchKit.

00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:11.206 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:13.446 A:middle
What is ResearchKit?

00:01:14.436 --> 00:01:17.236 A:middle
Well, the short answer is that
it's an open source project

00:01:17.326 --> 00:01:18.376 A:middle
and it's available on GitHub.

00:01:19.536 --> 00:01:20.896 A:middle
But for a slightly
longer answer,

00:01:21.296 --> 00:01:22.666 A:middle
we'll need to start
with some motivation.

00:01:23.576 --> 00:01:26.476 A:middle
Even if you never participated
in a medical research study,

00:01:27.306 --> 00:01:28.766 A:middle
you probably have seen
something like this

00:01:29.106 --> 00:01:30.816 A:middle
at a university or
at a hospital.

00:01:32.086 --> 00:01:33.586 A:middle
And if you have participated
in one,

00:01:33.876 --> 00:01:36.266 A:middle
you probably rang the
number, met the investigator,

00:01:36.626 --> 00:01:38.906 A:middle
and had the study and its risks
and benefits explained to you.

00:01:39.846 --> 00:01:41.556 A:middle
Then you might have
come in a few more times

00:01:41.636 --> 00:01:44.646 A:middle
to answer questions and
perhaps have samples taken.

00:01:45.536 --> 00:01:47.726 A:middle
Now, this is a pretty
heavyweight model

00:01:48.136 --> 00:01:49.206 A:middle
and researchers have told us

00:01:49.206 --> 00:01:51.006 A:middle
that there are three
problems with it.

00:01:51.556 --> 00:01:55.116 A:middle
The first problem is
limited participation.

00:01:57.896 --> 00:02:01.196 A:middle
Posting flyers around university
campuses limits participation



00:01:57.896 --> 00:02:01.196 A:middle
Posting flyers around university
campuses limits participation

00:02:01.576 --> 00:02:03.366 A:middle
to those that live
near that institution,

00:02:03.956 --> 00:02:06.436 A:middle
and to make a large study,
you need collaboration

00:02:06.436 --> 00:02:07.696 A:middle
across multiple research groups

00:02:08.356 --> 00:02:10.436 A:middle
which means these studies
happen infrequently

00:02:10.436 --> 00:02:11.246 A:middle
if they happen at all.

00:02:12.696 --> 00:02:15.996 A:middle
The second problem is
subjective and infrequent data.

00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:19.596 A:middle
Data is often collected
using surveys at monthly

00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:21.966 A:middle
or even longer intervals

00:02:22.586 --> 00:02:25.096 A:middle
and this affects both
the questions you can ask

00:02:25.096 --> 00:02:26.096 A:middle
and limits data quality.

00:02:26.676 --> 00:02:30.166 A:middle
The third problem is that
communication is one way.

00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:32.276 A:middle
You probably never
heard of the results

00:02:32.276 --> 00:02:33.276 A:middle
of the study you participated

00:02:33.276 --> 00:02:35.356 A:middle
in unless you knew the
investigators personally

00:02:36.776 --> 00:02:38.416 A:middle
and that's where we
think apps can help.

00:02:39.916 --> 00:02:42.896 A:middle
The wide reach of the App Store
distribution model can help

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:45.056 A:middle
researchers to reach a
broader subject population.

00:02:45.636 --> 00:02:48.766 A:middle
So the first five research
apps using ResearchKit have

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:52.006 A:middle
over 70,000 participants
enrolled which makes them some

00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:53.806 A:middle
of the largest studies
ever conducted

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:54.676 A:middle
in their respective fields.

00:02:54.676 --> 00:02:59.876 A:middle
Secondly, apps can stream
data continuously in contrast

00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:02.126 A:middle
to subjective and infrequent
manual data collection.



00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:02.126 A:middle
to subjective and infrequent
manual data collection.

00:03:03.326 --> 00:03:05.956 A:middle
And finally, apps can
keep a local record

00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:09.756 A:middle
for each participant
to give them feedback

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:11.436 A:middle
on how they are doing in
managing their symptoms.

00:03:12.136 --> 00:03:14.116 A:middle
And this helps to
keep them engaged

00:03:14.246 --> 00:03:15.796 A:middle
without raising the
burden on the investigator.

00:03:16.316 --> 00:03:19.006 A:middle
Now, at Apple, we wanted
to help make this a reality

00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:21.516 A:middle
for more studies and that's
why we built ResearchKit.

00:03:22.966 --> 00:03:24.546 A:middle
ResearchKit is an
open source framework,

00:03:24.666 --> 00:03:25.966 A:middle
and it's available on GitHub.

00:03:27.116 --> 00:03:29.596 A:middle
You can use it to more easily
create research apps whether

00:03:29.596 --> 00:03:32.656 A:middle
they are commercial apps
or they're for part of --

00:03:32.656 --> 00:03:34.806 A:middle
for an academic study.

00:03:35.276 --> 00:03:38.076 A:middle
Now, iOS already has great APIs

00:03:38.076 --> 00:03:39.526 A:middle
for collecting passive
data information,

00:03:39.826 --> 00:03:41.376 A:middle
like HealthKit and CoreMotion.

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:44.796 A:middle
But there are quite a few other
things that you need in order

00:03:44.796 --> 00:03:48.886 A:middle
to conduct a successful research
study from an app and we hope

00:03:48.886 --> 00:03:50.696 A:middle
that ResearchKit can help you
with some of those things.

00:03:51.776 --> 00:03:53.996 A:middle
Right now, ResearchKit
has three modules.

00:03:55.306 --> 00:03:56.686 A:middle
The first module is surveys.

00:03:57.436 --> 00:04:00.056 A:middle
ResearchKit provides standard
UI templates that you can use



00:03:57.436 --> 00:04:00.056 A:middle
ResearchKit provides standard
UI templates that you can use

00:04:00.056 --> 00:04:02.166 A:middle
for doing surveys on
an iPhone or on an iPad

00:04:02.686 --> 00:04:03.556 A:middle
and we've tested it with some

00:04:03.556 --> 00:04:05.016 A:middle
of the most common
survey instruments

00:04:05.466 --> 00:04:07.996 A:middle
from health research,
like SF12 or EQ5D.

00:04:07.996 --> 00:04:11.756 A:middle
The second module
is informed consent.

00:04:12.946 --> 00:04:15.756 A:middle
It's a common requirement in
human observational research.

00:04:16.565 --> 00:04:19.516 A:middle
To obtain consent from
participants while making sure

00:04:19.516 --> 00:04:21.565 A:middle
that they are fully informed
about the details of the study.

00:04:22.396 --> 00:04:24.506 A:middle
The details will
differ for every study,

00:04:24.586 --> 00:04:26.496 A:middle
and so again ResearchKit
provides templates

00:04:26.856 --> 00:04:29.686 A:middle
that you can use to
show this in your apps.

00:04:31.656 --> 00:04:34.126 A:middle
ResearchKit's third
module is active tasks.

00:04:35.156 --> 00:04:37.486 A:middle
An active task is a
semicontrolled test

00:04:37.786 --> 00:04:39.976 A:middle
where the participant is given
step-by-step instructions

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:43.606 A:middle
to perform the task while data
is collected using sensors

00:04:43.606 --> 00:04:44.066 A:middle
on the device.

00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:49.036 A:middle
For example, in this gait and
balance task, the phone is

00:04:49.036 --> 00:04:51.256 A:middle
in your pocket while
you walk back and forth,

00:04:51.496 --> 00:04:54.756 A:middle
and accelerometer and the
gyro are used to collect data

00:04:54.756 --> 00:04:55.636 A:middle
that can assess your gait.

00:04:56.506 --> 00:04:59.216 A:middle
So again, we've got three
things in ResearchKit.

00:04:59.386 --> 00:05:04.006 A:middle
We've got surveys, informed
consent and active tasks.



00:04:59.386 --> 00:05:04.006 A:middle
We've got surveys, informed
consent and active tasks.

00:05:04.426 --> 00:05:06.146 A:middle
Now, when we announced
ResearchKit,

00:05:06.786 --> 00:05:07.896 A:middle
the investigators we worked

00:05:07.896 --> 00:05:10.136 A:middle
with simultaneously released
their apps to the App Store.

00:05:11.256 --> 00:05:14.116 A:middle
And even now, these apps are
being used to collect study data

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:17.616 A:middle
from conditions as diverse
as Parkinson's, diabetes,

00:05:17.876 --> 00:05:20.446 A:middle
cardiovascular disease,
asthma and breast cancer.

00:05:21.606 --> 00:05:24.756 A:middle
And with these partner
institutions we've open sourced

00:05:24.926 --> 00:05:25.776 A:middle
the codes for these apps,

00:05:26.086 --> 00:05:28.496 A:middle
as well as the app core common
library that they all share,

00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:32.266 A:middle
so that can help you
get started on your app

00:05:32.266 --> 00:05:33.086 A:middle
if you need a jumpstart.

00:05:33.446 --> 00:05:35.406 A:middle
Now what do the apps
actually do?

00:05:36.896 --> 00:05:39.376 A:middle
Well, they all used the
informed consent module

00:05:39.376 --> 00:05:41.766 A:middle
from ResearchKit during
the onboarding process,

00:05:42.416 --> 00:05:44.596 A:middle
but then after that, once the
participants are enrolled,

00:05:45.586 --> 00:05:46.936 A:middle
they collect data
in a couple of ways.

00:05:47.506 --> 00:05:50.026 A:middle
First they use scheduled
activities,

00:05:51.106 --> 00:05:53.356 A:middle
using ResearchKit's surveys
and active task modules

00:05:53.666 --> 00:05:55.096 A:middle
to collect more subjective
measures.

00:05:55.956 --> 00:05:58.386 A:middle
In addition, they get
objective measures

00:05:58.696 --> 00:06:02.076 A:middle
by doing passive data collection
using HealthKit and CoreMotion.



00:05:58.696 --> 00:06:02.076 A:middle
by doing passive data collection
using HealthKit and CoreMotion.

00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:07.586 A:middle
And in addition, they address

00:06:07.706 --> 00:06:09.986 A:middle
that one-way communication
problem

00:06:10.156 --> 00:06:13.926 A:middle
by including a dashboard tab,
which allows participants to see

00:06:14.296 --> 00:06:16.786 A:middle
and track both subjective
measures like their mood,

00:06:16.786 --> 00:06:19.526 A:middle
perhaps derived from surveys
and objective measures

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:24.396 A:middle
like their weight which might
be derived from HealthKit.

00:06:24.396 --> 00:06:27.126 A:middle
So that's ResearchKit and
the apps that are using it.

00:06:28.006 --> 00:06:31.176 A:middle
But as we developed ResearchKit,
we learned a few things

00:06:31.526 --> 00:06:34.216 A:middle
about what else is involved
in building an app-based study

00:06:34.496 --> 00:06:36.016 A:middle
that we thought is
important to share with you.

00:06:36.246 --> 00:06:37.676 A:middle
So during this section
of the talk,

00:06:37.676 --> 00:06:39.206 A:middle
I'll share some of
those with you.

00:06:40.156 --> 00:06:42.646 A:middle
So if you're an engineer
building a research app,

00:06:43.276 --> 00:06:45.076 A:middle
you're probably not the
only person on the project

00:06:45.246 --> 00:06:48.106 A:middle
and the rest of your team
will have a variety of things

00:06:48.596 --> 00:06:51.346 A:middle
that they'll need to do, and
I'll cover some of those now.

00:06:52.156 --> 00:06:54.546 A:middle
Probably the most
important will be

00:06:54.546 --> 00:06:57.426 A:middle
to approach an ethics committee

00:06:57.616 --> 00:07:00.096 A:middle
or institutional
review board associated



00:06:57.616 --> 00:07:00.096 A:middle
or institutional
review board associated

00:07:00.096 --> 00:07:02.216 A:middle
with your institution,
in order to --

00:07:03.566 --> 00:07:05.606 A:middle
in order to obtain some
sort of ethics review

00:07:05.866 --> 00:07:06.746 A:middle
for the study protocol.

00:07:07.316 --> 00:07:11.466 A:middle
As part of this, you'll
need to decide what it means

00:07:11.466 --> 00:07:15.496 A:middle
for the participant to be
informed about the study.

00:07:15.656 --> 00:07:17.496 A:middle
You'll take this
paper-based form

00:07:17.796 --> 00:07:19.136 A:middle
and hopefully you will
be able to compress it

00:07:19.136 --> 00:07:21.696 A:middle
down into something that's
appropriate for a mobile app,

00:07:21.956 --> 00:07:23.996 A:middle
and we will cover that into a
little more detail when we get

00:07:23.996 --> 00:07:25.936 A:middle
to the inform and consent
module of ResearchKit.

00:07:27.806 --> 00:07:32.586 A:middle
Next, since ResearchKit doesn't
provide a back end service,

00:07:32.876 --> 00:07:35.066 A:middle
you need to plan for how
you'll store your study data.

00:07:35.416 --> 00:07:38.356 A:middle
So that might mean you stand up
the survey yourself or contract

00:07:38.356 --> 00:07:39.526 A:middle
with a third-party
service provider.

00:07:40.566 --> 00:07:43.406 A:middle
Either way, you'll
need to account

00:07:43.406 --> 00:07:45.326 A:middle
for both data security
and privacy.

00:07:45.896 --> 00:07:49.626 A:middle
And lastly, you'll need to plan

00:07:49.786 --> 00:07:51.556 A:middle
for sharing your
study data whether

00:07:51.556 --> 00:07:53.866 A:middle
with participants perhaps in
the form of a dashboard tab

00:07:53.866 --> 00:07:57.306 A:middle
or some other method, or
with other investigators

00:07:57.706 --> 00:08:00.106 A:middle
which might require you
generating a very broad



00:07:57.706 --> 00:08:00.106 A:middle
which might require you
generating a very broad

00:08:00.196 --> 00:08:00.906 A:middle
informed consent.

00:08:00.966 --> 00:08:03.716 A:middle
So as you can see,
there are a variety

00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:05.646 A:middle
of issues outside
the actual app build

00:08:05.996 --> 00:08:07.956 A:middle
that will affect the design
of your study-based app

00:08:08.716 --> 00:08:10.176 A:middle
and for more resources on these,

00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:11.746 A:middle
I would point you
to ResearchKit.

00:08:11.746 --> 00:08:14.236 A:middle
org, our website, and also

00:08:14.516 --> 00:08:16.346 A:middle
to our ResearchKit
user's mailing list

00:08:16.656 --> 00:08:18.216 A:middle
where you can reach others

00:08:18.286 --> 00:08:19.666 A:middle
who have also been
through this before.

00:08:20.216 --> 00:08:22.966 A:middle
So without further adieu,

00:08:22.966 --> 00:08:24.946 A:middle
let's get on to building
apps with ResearchKit.

00:08:25.166 --> 00:08:26.606 A:middle
How can ResearchKit help
you in your studies?

00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:32.366 A:middle
So as I mentioned before,
there are three modules

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:34.905 A:middle
in ResearchKit, surveys,
informed consent

00:08:35.275 --> 00:08:37.775 A:middle
and active tasks and
all of those modules

00:08:37.775 --> 00:08:40.846 A:middle
in ResearchKit behave
more or less the same way.

00:08:41.486 --> 00:08:45.576 A:middle
Each activity that
the user is asked

00:08:45.576 --> 00:08:47.366 A:middle
to do is modeled as a task.

00:08:47.946 --> 00:08:51.906 A:middle
And each task can
contain one or more steps.

00:08:52.036 --> 00:08:54.536 A:middle
Now, in order to use a task,
you will want to present it

00:08:54.536 --> 00:08:57.986 A:middle
to the user and to do that, you
will use task view controller.

00:08:59.046 --> 00:09:02.406 A:middle
Now, a task view controller is
a container view controller,



00:08:59.046 --> 00:09:02.406 A:middle
Now, a task view controller is
a container view controller,

00:09:02.406 --> 00:09:04.166 A:middle
a bit like a navigation
controller

00:09:04.166 --> 00:09:05.956 A:middle
or a tab bar controller that
you are probably familiar

00:09:05.956 --> 00:09:08.536 A:middle
with from the UI kit.

00:09:08.746 --> 00:09:12.366 A:middle
Now, when you present
the task view controller,

00:09:13.096 --> 00:09:16.276 A:middle
it will get the first step
from the task and then display

00:09:16.276 --> 00:09:18.966 A:middle
within the task view controller
a step view controller

00:09:18.966 --> 00:09:21.066 A:middle
that displays the
data for that step.

00:09:21.676 --> 00:09:24.916 A:middle
Then when the step completes
the task view controller will

00:09:24.916 --> 00:09:26.836 A:middle
collect the result from
it and collate the results

00:09:26.836 --> 00:09:29.306 A:middle
from all the steps in that task.

00:09:29.906 --> 00:09:32.556 A:middle
Finally, the task view
controller will notify its

00:09:32.556 --> 00:09:33.926 A:middle
delegate when the
task is complete

00:09:34.836 --> 00:09:36.006 A:middle
and you will get a task result.

00:09:36.896 --> 00:09:39.346 A:middle
This task result will have
a corresponding step result

00:09:39.346 --> 00:09:40.546 A:middle
for the step you
have been through,

00:09:40.546 --> 00:09:41.876 A:middle
and if you have more steps,

00:09:41.876 --> 00:09:44.316 A:middle
you will have correspondingly
more step results.

00:09:44.726 --> 00:09:47.826 A:middle
So that's the object
model in ResearchKit

00:09:48.216 --> 00:09:51.696 A:middle
and now let's take a little
bit deeper dive into one

00:09:51.696 --> 00:09:53.416 A:middle
of the core objects
which is the step.

00:09:53.976 --> 00:10:00.346 A:middle
So we will look at steps next.



00:09:53.976 --> 00:10:00.346 A:middle
So we will look at steps next.

00:10:00.346 --> 00:10:03.176 A:middle
In ResearchKit, a step
really corresponds

00:10:03.176 --> 00:10:06.006 A:middle
to the basic template that
you use for each screen

00:10:06.236 --> 00:10:07.206 A:middle
in a ResearchKit task.

00:10:08.226 --> 00:10:10.186 A:middle
And subclasses are
a kind of step,

00:10:10.426 --> 00:10:13.226 A:middle
which is just an abstract base
class, can be used for each

00:10:13.226 --> 00:10:14.456 A:middle
of the different types for
each of the different steps

00:10:14.456 --> 00:10:16.076 A:middle
that you might need
for different modules

00:10:16.076 --> 00:10:17.436 A:middle
in ResearchKit, like surveys.

00:10:17.436 --> 00:10:19.296 A:middle
So you might have an
instruction, survey question

00:10:19.296 --> 00:10:21.986 A:middle
and multiquestion forms or for
other things like active tasks

00:10:21.986 --> 00:10:23.236 A:middle
where you need countdown timers

00:10:23.616 --> 00:10:29.106 A:middle
and perhaps a memory game
for a cognitive task.

00:10:29.276 --> 00:10:32.706 A:middle
So this basic template generally
presents the step content

00:10:32.706 --> 00:10:35.956 A:middle
in the middle of the
screen and this will --

00:10:36.126 --> 00:10:39.646 A:middle
this has some predefined
elements which we'll see next.

00:10:40.256 --> 00:10:43.546 A:middle
In addition, it generally
includes the forward navigation

00:10:43.546 --> 00:10:46.216 A:middle
controls which are displayed
within the step view controller.

00:10:46.216 --> 00:10:51.696 A:middle
So what does that
look like in code?

00:10:52.516 --> 00:10:57.156 A:middle
Well, you will get an ORKStep
as the abstract base class,

00:10:57.206 --> 00:10:59.196 A:middle
and you'll see here that it's
a subclass within this object.

00:10:59.526 --> 00:11:02.116 A:middle
Now, I should mention that the
framework itself is written



00:10:59.526 --> 00:11:02.116 A:middle
Now, I should mention that the
framework itself is written

00:11:02.116 --> 00:11:04.276 A:middle
in Objective-C but it's
perfectly usable from Swift

00:11:04.506 --> 00:11:07.306 A:middle
and we added both
nullability and generics to it

00:11:07.306 --> 00:11:09.036 A:middle
so you can use it with Swift 2.

00:11:09.036 --> 00:11:10.836 A:middle
0. So what are some

00:11:11.016 --> 00:11:15.516 A:middle
of the important
properties of the base class.

00:11:15.896 --> 00:11:19.216 A:middle
The first and probably the most
key property is the identifier

00:11:19.516 --> 00:11:21.416 A:middle
and this is a string that
you the developer provide.

00:11:22.036 --> 00:11:25.336 A:middle
It could be a human readable
string, or it could be a UUID,

00:11:25.336 --> 00:11:26.916 A:middle
or an identifier that
corresponds to a record

00:11:26.916 --> 00:11:29.066 A:middle
of this step and the
corresponding task

00:11:29.066 --> 00:11:29.706 A:middle
in your database.

00:11:31.696 --> 00:11:33.366 A:middle
The importance of
this identifier is

00:11:33.366 --> 00:11:36.116 A:middle
that it links the step with
the corresponding step result

00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:40.186 A:middle
and it needs to be unique
within the context of your task.

00:11:40.386 --> 00:11:44.616 A:middle
Next, all steps have
a title, and text.

00:11:45.276 --> 00:11:48.346 A:middle
And these generally fit into
the same corresponding place

00:11:48.346 --> 00:11:49.276 A:middle
in each step template.

00:11:49.816 --> 00:11:54.186 A:middle
If you are writing a question,
for example, for a question step

00:11:54.186 --> 00:11:56.686 A:middle
in a survey, you will
typically put a short title

00:11:57.006 --> 00:12:02.756 A:middle
and the actual question itself
will go into the text property.



00:11:57.006 --> 00:12:02.756 A:middle
and the actual question itself
will go into the text property.

00:12:02.836 --> 00:12:04.526 A:middle
One more property
worth mentioning is the

00:12:04.526 --> 00:12:05.296 A:middle
optional property.

00:12:05.666 --> 00:12:08.736 A:middle
So each of the steps in a survey
and ResearchKit or, in fact many

00:12:08.736 --> 00:12:11.556 A:middle
of the other steps can
be optional and, in fact,

00:12:11.556 --> 00:12:12.466 A:middle
they are optional by default.

00:12:12.706 --> 00:12:13.716 A:middle
If you need to turn that off,

00:12:13.716 --> 00:12:15.606 A:middle
for example because a
particular answer is required,

00:12:15.856 --> 00:12:16.776 A:middle
then you can use this property.

00:12:17.786 --> 00:12:20.926 A:middle
So that's steps, but to use
a step you need to put it

00:12:20.926 --> 00:12:23.616 A:middle
in the context of a task.

00:12:23.706 --> 00:12:27.566 A:middle
Now tasks in ResearchKit don't
have an abstract base class,

00:12:27.566 --> 00:12:28.576 A:middle
instead it's just a protocol

00:12:29.126 --> 00:12:32.316 A:middle
which defines how the task
view controller will interact

00:12:32.316 --> 00:12:33.106 A:middle
with each task.

00:12:34.356 --> 00:12:36.716 A:middle
Again, there's a key property
which is the identifier

00:12:37.206 --> 00:12:39.716 A:middle
which uniquely identifies
this task result compared

00:12:39.716 --> 00:12:44.866 A:middle
to other task results that
you might collect in this app.

00:12:45.126 --> 00:12:47.776 A:middle
Next, though, the task
view controller needs

00:12:47.776 --> 00:12:50.966 A:middle
to know what is the next step
in this task, and for that,

00:12:50.966 --> 00:12:53.186 A:middle
we define the step after
step protocol method

00:12:53.266 --> 00:12:55.656 A:middle
where we pass the current step
from the task view controller.

00:12:58.296 --> 00:13:00.076 A:middle
Often, you'll just
return the next step.



00:12:58.296 --> 00:13:00.076 A:middle
Often, you'll just
return the next step.

00:13:00.736 --> 00:13:02.606 A:middle
But sometimes you
will want to know --

00:13:02.606 --> 00:13:03.836 A:middle
you will want to
decide what test --

00:13:04.366 --> 00:13:07.936 A:middle
what step to show based
on the results so far.

00:13:08.056 --> 00:13:10.486 A:middle
So, for instance, if I answered
A, you want to get to step A,

00:13:10.486 --> 00:13:14.306 A:middle
and if I answered B, you want
to go to step B and for that,

00:13:14.556 --> 00:13:17.136 A:middle
the task view controller will
pass the task a result --

00:13:17.376 --> 00:13:20.126 A:middle
the task result so far, that you
can use to make that decision.

00:13:22.116 --> 00:13:24.056 A:middle
When looking for the
first step in the task,

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:26.366 A:middle
the task view controller will
pass nil as the current step

00:13:26.926 --> 00:13:28.746 A:middle
and when the task is complete

00:13:28.746 --> 00:13:31.036 A:middle
and there are no more
steps you can return nil

00:13:31.036 --> 00:13:32.186 A:middle
to tell the task view controller

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:35.656 A:middle
that there are no
more steps to go to.

00:13:35.876 --> 00:13:38.016 A:middle
Similarly, the task
view controller may want

00:13:38.176 --> 00:13:40.316 A:middle
to ask your task what the
previous steps should be.

00:13:40.836 --> 00:13:43.556 A:middle
So the step before method
allows to you do things

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:44.906 A:middle
like prevent backward
navigation.

00:13:45.486 --> 00:13:48.906 A:middle
So there are a variety
of other properties

00:13:48.906 --> 00:13:50.816 A:middle
and methods on the
task protocol.

00:13:51.256 --> 00:13:53.726 A:middle
And implementing a task can
be a complicated endeavor

00:13:54.136 --> 00:13:57.756 A:middle
and so ResearchKit includes
an implementation of ORKTask

00:13:58.266 --> 00:14:01.266 A:middle
which is ORKOrder task for
the simple case where you want



00:13:58.266 --> 00:14:01.266 A:middle
which is ORKOrder task for
the simple case where you want

00:14:01.266 --> 00:14:03.376 A:middle
to present your steps
in consecutive order.

00:14:04.006 --> 00:14:06.516 A:middle
So here you pass an
identifier and an array of steps

00:14:07.456 --> 00:14:09.956 A:middle
and you can get those steps
back from a read only property.

00:14:09.956 --> 00:14:12.266 A:middle
But the task view
controller only interacts

00:14:12.266 --> 00:14:15.286 A:middle
with its ordered task
through the ORKtask protocol,

00:14:15.286 --> 00:14:16.956 A:middle
so you call it step
after step instead

00:14:16.956 --> 00:14:19.066 A:middle
of accessing that
step's property.

00:14:20.406 --> 00:14:22.146 A:middle
Now if you need conditional
logic,

00:14:22.586 --> 00:14:25.506 A:middle
there is now another version of
ordered task, a subclass of it,

00:14:25.506 --> 00:14:27.866 A:middle
called ORKNavigable ordered
task, which allows you

00:14:27.866 --> 00:14:29.296 A:middle
to specify predicates
on the results

00:14:29.296 --> 00:14:30.646 A:middle
and corresponding
destination steps.

00:14:31.386 --> 00:14:33.046 A:middle
This is a recent
addition to the framework

00:14:33.176 --> 00:14:35.546 A:middle
from an external contributor
and we don't have time

00:14:35.546 --> 00:14:37.946 A:middle
to cover it today but you can
find the details on GitHub.

00:14:38.946 --> 00:14:39.936 A:middle
So that's tasks.

00:14:41.416 --> 00:14:43.106 A:middle
But to use a task, you
will need to present it

00:14:43.106 --> 00:14:44.106 A:middle
with a task view controller.

00:14:44.886 --> 00:14:46.386 A:middle
So let's look at the task
view controller next.

00:14:47.416 --> 00:14:48.436 A:middle
So you'll start with a task.

00:14:49.076 --> 00:14:52.866 A:middle
And you'll create a task view
controller passing at the task.

00:14:53.116 --> 00:14:55.576 A:middle
But you notice this second
property, task run UUID

00:14:55.576 --> 00:14:58.286 A:middle
and that is a UUID

00:14:58.426 --> 00:15:00.946 A:middle
which uniquely identifies this
particular run of the task.



00:14:58.426 --> 00:15:00.946 A:middle
which uniquely identifies this
particular run of the task.

00:15:01.496 --> 00:15:04.506 A:middle
So if here we pass nil

00:15:04.576 --> 00:15:08.206 A:middle
which indicates this
is a new task instance.

00:15:08.686 --> 00:15:09.616 A:middle
We're starting from scratch.

00:15:10.096 --> 00:15:13.016 A:middle
But if I were to save my
work, say I had a long survey

00:15:13.016 --> 00:15:16.566 A:middle
and I wanted to pause in the
middle, then I might save

00:15:16.566 --> 00:15:18.596 A:middle
and when we restarted
this task by scheduling it

00:15:18.596 --> 00:15:20.006 A:middle
in new task view
controller, we would want

00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:21.746 A:middle
to restore the old task run UUID

00:15:21.746 --> 00:15:25.466 A:middle
because it's really
the same run of a task.

00:15:25.646 --> 00:15:27.076 A:middle
Then you need to
set the delegate.

00:15:27.346 --> 00:15:28.816 A:middle
If you want to find out
when the task is finished,

00:15:29.066 --> 00:15:30.356 A:middle
you use the delegate callback.

00:15:30.756 --> 00:15:32.836 A:middle
But similarly, there are
also delegate callbacks

00:15:32.836 --> 00:15:33.886 A:middle
that give you opportunities

00:15:33.886 --> 00:15:35.746 A:middle
to customize the task
view controller's behavior

00:15:36.066 --> 00:15:39.306 A:middle
for example, substituting a new
step view controller in place

00:15:39.306 --> 00:15:41.526 A:middle
of the default one
for a particular step.

00:15:42.606 --> 00:15:46.226 A:middle
In addition, some tasks
can produce output,

00:15:46.226 --> 00:15:47.306 A:middle
a file-based output.

00:15:47.536 --> 00:15:50.826 A:middle
So for example if you are
using a microphone in your task

00:15:50.966 --> 00:15:53.046 A:middle
to collect audio data, we'd
want to write that data

00:15:53.046 --> 00:15:55.846 A:middle
to audio file during the task.

00:15:56.006 --> 00:15:57.656 A:middle
In ResearchKit, to support that,

00:15:57.656 --> 00:15:59.036 A:middle
you'll specify an
output directory

00:15:59.036 --> 00:16:01.746 A:middle
to your task view controller
where the file-based output



00:15:59.036 --> 00:16:01.746 A:middle
to your task view controller
where the file-based output

00:16:01.746 --> 00:16:02.826 A:middle
from that task should go.

00:16:03.336 --> 00:16:05.836 A:middle
When the task completes, you
will need to process those files

00:16:05.836 --> 00:16:07.616 A:middle
and then be responsible
for cleaning them up.

00:16:08.286 --> 00:16:10.546 A:middle
Finally you'll present the
task view controller modally

00:16:10.546 --> 00:16:11.456 A:middle
and get something like this.

00:16:12.566 --> 00:16:15.986 A:middle
So, this task view
controller as you can see,

00:16:16.586 --> 00:16:17.926 A:middle
has a fairly standard behavior

00:16:18.206 --> 00:16:20.556 A:middle
and the task view controller
itself only controls a very

00:16:20.556 --> 00:16:21.936 A:middle
small amount of the
screen real estate.

00:16:22.516 --> 00:16:24.386 A:middle
So it controls this
navigation bar,

00:16:24.676 --> 00:16:25.946 A:middle
setting the progress indication,

00:16:25.986 --> 00:16:27.906 A:middle
and possibly some backward
navigation controls.

00:16:28.546 --> 00:16:31.056 A:middle
In addition, it gives the step
view controller just enough

00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:34.116 A:middle
information in order to
show the forward navigation

00:16:34.116 --> 00:16:34.846 A:middle
controls correctly.

00:16:34.846 --> 00:16:37.636 A:middle
So that's the task
view controller.

00:16:38.296 --> 00:16:39.406 A:middle
But what about getting results?

00:16:39.676 --> 00:16:41.906 A:middle
Well, let's look at how
you get results next.

00:16:43.096 --> 00:16:45.636 A:middle
So here's the did finish
with reason delegate callback

00:16:46.206 --> 00:16:49.376 A:middle
and your delegate will receive
this when the task is complete.

00:16:50.186 --> 00:16:52.676 A:middle
At that point you will get
a reason why the task view

00:16:52.676 --> 00:16:55.556 A:middle
controller finished and one
reason it might finish is

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:57.696 A:middle
that the user chose to save
their work in the middle of task

00:16:58.146 --> 00:17:00.906 A:middle
and in that case you'll want
to extract the restoration data



00:16:58.146 --> 00:17:00.906 A:middle
and in that case you'll want
to extract the restoration data

00:17:01.246 --> 00:17:04.665 A:middle
which is an opaque NSData
property and then save it

00:17:04.665 --> 00:17:06.056 A:middle
for later, when you want

00:17:06.056 --> 00:17:08.586 A:middle
to resume the task you will
instantiate a new task view

00:17:08.586 --> 00:17:10.616 A:middle
controller and pass it
that restoration data

00:17:10.616 --> 00:17:11.586 A:middle
in a special initializer.

00:17:12.455 --> 00:17:17.016 A:middle
But in the usual case, your task
will have completed successfully

00:17:17.316 --> 00:17:18.886 A:middle
and in that case you
want to grab the result

00:17:18.915 --> 00:17:21.316 A:middle
from the task view controller's
result property and do something

00:17:21.316 --> 00:17:23.846 A:middle
with it, like serialize
it, send it to a server

00:17:24.175 --> 00:17:27.136 A:middle
or perhaps analyze it
in order to display some

00:17:27.136 --> 00:17:28.316 A:middle
of the information to the user.

00:17:29.296 --> 00:17:31.976 A:middle
Finally, you'll need to dismiss
the task view controller,

00:17:32.586 --> 00:17:34.576 A:middle
ecause you presented the
task view controller,

00:17:34.576 --> 00:17:36.606 A:middle
you are also responsible
for dismissing it.

00:17:38.156 --> 00:17:41.886 A:middle
Now you have seen a basic
overview of ResearchKit and how

00:17:41.886 --> 00:17:43.416 A:middle
to use itsthe task-based model.

00:17:44.086 --> 00:17:45.846 A:middle
Now let's see how that
fits in with the first

00:17:45.846 --> 00:17:47.736 A:middle
of ResearchKit's modules,
the surveys module.

00:17:49.296 --> 00:17:51.886 A:middle
So surveys in ResearchKit
are made up of three things:

00:17:52.096 --> 00:17:55.196 A:middle
instructions, survey questions
and multiquestion forms.

00:17:55.806 --> 00:17:57.806 A:middle
And in turn, each of those
corresponds to a step.

00:17:58.396 --> 00:17:59.726 A:middle
So we have a survey question --

00:17:59.726 --> 00:18:01.906 A:middle
I'm sorry, we have
an instruction step,



00:17:59.726 --> 00:18:01.906 A:middle
I'm sorry, we have
an instruction step,

00:18:02.136 --> 00:18:04.076 A:middle
and a question step,
and a form step.

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:07.076 A:middle
Now, instruction steps
add very little on top

00:18:07.076 --> 00:18:09.296 A:middle
of what we already have
in the ORKStep base class

00:18:09.676 --> 00:18:11.446 A:middle
but question steps and form
stems have a little more

00:18:11.446 --> 00:18:11.786 A:middle
to them.

00:18:12.316 --> 00:18:13.606 A:middle
So we will look at that next.

00:18:14.456 --> 00:18:16.716 A:middle
Here's a question step,
and like any other step,

00:18:16.716 --> 00:18:19.356 A:middle
it has an identifier which needs
to be unique within the task

00:18:20.216 --> 00:18:22.836 A:middle
and that question step
also has an answer format.

00:18:23.696 --> 00:18:26.416 A:middle
That answer format is a
subclass of ORKAnswer format

00:18:26.416 --> 00:18:27.856 A:middle
that corresponds to
the particular type

00:18:27.856 --> 00:18:29.016 A:middle
of step you want to present.

00:18:29.826 --> 00:18:32.576 A:middle
So for the subclasses
cover a wide gamut

00:18:32.636 --> 00:18:34.166 A:middle
so we might have a
Boolean answer format

00:18:34.166 --> 00:18:36.546 A:middle
for a yes/no question, a
text choice answer format,

00:18:36.736 --> 00:18:38.846 A:middle
an image choice answer format
to give an image scale,

00:18:39.186 --> 00:18:41.586 A:middle
or date based and
time interval formats

00:18:41.846 --> 00:18:42.686 A:middle
and there's a wide variety.

00:18:42.686 --> 00:18:43.476 A:middle
You can see them on GitHub.

00:18:44.096 --> 00:18:46.496 A:middle
So that's question steps.

00:18:46.496 --> 00:18:47.376 A:middle
What about form steps?

00:18:47.946 --> 00:18:52.456 A:middle
So here's a form step, and the
form step has an identifier,

00:18:52.456 --> 00:18:54.326 A:middle
and it also has an
array of form items.

00:18:55.246 --> 00:18:56.436 A:middle
So here's the array
of form items

00:18:56.436 --> 00:18:58.716 A:middle
and each form item has
an identifier which needs

00:18:58.716 --> 00:19:01.056 A:middle
to be unique within the
context of that form step.



00:18:58.716 --> 00:19:01.056 A:middle
to be unique within the
context of that form step.

00:19:01.566 --> 00:19:06.276 A:middle
Like a question step, a form
item has an answer format

00:19:06.686 --> 00:19:10.806 A:middle
and ResearchKit supports
all the same answer formats

00:19:10.806 --> 00:19:13.826 A:middle
in form items that are
supported in questions.

00:19:14.046 --> 00:19:16.906 A:middle
So, for example, we might mix
a text choice answer format

00:19:17.486 --> 00:19:19.756 A:middle
with a numeric answer
format in the same form.

00:19:19.836 --> 00:19:24.766 A:middle
So that's the object model
for the model objects

00:19:24.826 --> 00:19:26.696 A:middle
for ResearchKit surveys.

00:19:27.516 --> 00:19:28.666 A:middle
Now how do you get the results?

00:19:29.086 --> 00:19:32.636 A:middle
So here's an ordered
task with an identifier

00:19:32.636 --> 00:19:33.436 A:middle
and an array of steps.

00:19:34.526 --> 00:19:37.916 A:middle
And when the task completes
you will get a task result.

00:19:38.336 --> 00:19:41.616 A:middle
Again, with an identifier which
matches and an array of results.

00:19:42.186 --> 00:19:45.516 A:middle
If this ordered task started
with an instruction step,

00:19:46.146 --> 00:19:47.986 A:middle
then that instruction step
would have an identifier

00:19:48.046 --> 00:19:51.076 A:middle
and when the task completes
you have a step result

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:52.446 A:middle
with a corresponding identifier.

00:19:53.336 --> 00:19:56.316 A:middle
The results property of this
step result will be empty,

00:19:56.316 --> 00:19:58.206 A:middle
however because there's no
data being collected during

00:19:58.206 --> 00:19:58.906 A:middle
that instruction step.

00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:00.376 A:middle
All we did is show
them the instruction.



00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:00.376 A:middle
All we did is show
them the instruction.

00:20:01.676 --> 00:20:03.916 A:middle
This object does have some
useful properties, though,

00:20:04.086 --> 00:20:06.336 A:middle
like the start date and the
end date to show you how long

00:20:06.336 --> 00:20:09.916 A:middle
that instruction
was on the screen.

00:20:10.096 --> 00:20:11.576 A:middle
In addition, you might
have a question step.

00:20:11.576 --> 00:20:15.696 A:middle
And that question step
will have an identifier

00:20:15.696 --> 00:20:17.386 A:middle
that matches its
corresponding step result.

00:20:17.936 --> 00:20:22.606 A:middle
And then unlike the step result
for the instruction step,

00:20:22.746 --> 00:20:24.056 A:middle
this will actually
have a child result

00:20:24.446 --> 00:20:26.636 A:middle
which carries the actual
answer corresponding

00:20:26.636 --> 00:20:27.436 A:middle
to that answer format.

00:20:29.766 --> 00:20:31.206 A:middle
Results from forms
work very similarly,

00:20:31.586 --> 00:20:33.676 A:middle
so here's an ordered task
containing a single form step,

00:20:34.486 --> 00:20:37.406 A:middle
with two form items and again
these identifiers are unique

00:20:37.676 --> 00:20:40.276 A:middle
within the form step.

00:20:40.466 --> 00:20:42.036 A:middle
And when you get
the results back,

00:20:42.466 --> 00:20:44.876 A:middle
you will have a task result
with the identifier that matches

00:20:45.876 --> 00:20:48.216 A:middle
and you will have a step
result with identifier

00:20:48.216 --> 00:20:49.166 A:middle
that matches that form step.

00:20:50.506 --> 00:20:53.156 A:middle
And then you will have
corresponding child question

00:20:53.156 --> 00:20:55.736 A:middle
results, this time you will have
an array of question results one

00:20:55.736 --> 00:20:56.546 A:middle
for each form item

00:20:56.916 --> 00:21:00.006 A:middle
with identifiers matching
the corresponding form items.



00:20:56.916 --> 00:21:00.006 A:middle
with identifiers matching
the corresponding form items.

00:21:02.626 --> 00:21:05.796 A:middle
So that's the object
model in ResearchKit

00:21:05.796 --> 00:21:08.186 A:middle
and how you can use survey,
use it to present surveys.

00:21:09.576 --> 00:21:11.136 A:middle
Now I will show you a
brief demo in Xcode.

00:21:11.716 --> 00:21:21.816 A:middle
So here we have an example app,
which displays the table view

00:21:21.816 --> 00:21:25.036 A:middle
with a list of the available
tasks and here I'm going

00:21:25.036 --> 00:21:27.076 A:middle
to be putting together a
survey task to show you some

00:21:27.076 --> 00:21:30.936 A:middle
of the features that I
have just been through.

00:21:30.986 --> 00:21:33.686 A:middle
Now, the table view
controller here,

00:21:34.316 --> 00:21:43.406 A:middle
the table view controller here
has a -- when you select a row,

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:46.246 A:middle
it will instantiate a task
view controller and display

00:21:46.246 --> 00:21:47.716 A:middle
that particular task,
setting the delegate

00:21:47.716 --> 00:21:50.296 A:middle
and the output directory
and when the task completes,

00:21:50.926 --> 00:21:55.646 A:middle
we'll display -- we will
dismiss the task view controller

00:21:55.646 --> 00:21:56.726 A:middle
in the did finish callback.

00:21:58.766 --> 00:22:00.736 A:middle
Now, switching over to
the task enumeration



00:21:58.766 --> 00:22:00.736 A:middle
Now, switching over to
the task enumeration

00:22:00.736 --> 00:22:02.806 A:middle
which holds the actual
tasks you'll see

00:22:02.806 --> 00:22:05.396 A:middle
that I defined all cases to
include just the survey case

00:22:05.816 --> 00:22:08.656 A:middle
and the represented task
is currently an empty task

00:22:08.656 --> 00:22:10.776 A:middle
but I will now define
it to be a survey task,

00:22:11.336 --> 00:22:13.586 A:middle
which I will create next.

00:22:15.456 --> 00:22:20.756 A:middle
So to create my survey task, I
will define a computed property,

00:22:20.876 --> 00:22:23.926 A:middle
survey task in which I
create an ordered task

00:22:23.926 --> 00:22:26.386 A:middle
with an identifier survey
and attach an array of steps.

00:22:26.716 --> 00:22:27.976 A:middle
Right now this array is empty.

00:22:28.316 --> 00:22:29.416 A:middle
So I will add an
instruction step.

00:22:30.186 --> 00:22:32.106 A:middle
Now this instruction
step has an identifier.

00:22:32.286 --> 00:22:33.726 A:middle
Here I'm just generating
the identifiers

00:22:33.726 --> 00:22:36.916 A:middle
because I know they will
be unique within this task.

00:22:36.916 --> 00:22:40.026 A:middle
I set a title and text,

00:22:40.026 --> 00:22:41.336 A:middle
which will be displayed
on that screen.

00:22:41.446 --> 00:22:42.416 A:middle
And you'll notice
that I've marked these

00:22:42.416 --> 00:22:43.306 A:middle
as localized strings.

00:22:43.306 --> 00:22:44.846 A:middle
And that's because the content

00:22:44.846 --> 00:22:47.076 A:middle
of these model objects is
really localized content.

00:22:47.076 --> 00:22:49.326 A:middle
So if you're going to use
your app in multiple locales,

00:22:49.626 --> 00:22:52.656 A:middle
then you'll need to
localize this content as well

00:22:52.656 --> 00:22:55.166 A:middle
as other things you might
localize in your app.

00:22:55.586 --> 00:22:58.676 A:middle
Then I might add a question step

00:22:59.316 --> 00:23:02.016 A:middle
and this question step
is a yes/no question.



00:22:59.316 --> 00:23:02.016 A:middle
and this question step
is a yes/no question.

00:23:02.016 --> 00:23:03.246 A:middle
So it's got a boolean
answer format,

00:23:03.686 --> 00:23:06.696 A:middle
it's got an identifier set and
a title, and the question is:

00:23:06.946 --> 00:23:08.956 A:middle
During a typical day, does
your health now limit you

00:23:08.956 --> 00:23:10.386 A:middle
when climbing several
flights of stairs?

00:23:11.006 --> 00:23:13.076 A:middle
This is a fairly typical
question that you might see

00:23:13.126 --> 00:23:14.156 A:middle
in a general health survey.

00:23:14.986 --> 00:23:17.456 A:middle
Since we've been talking about
forms, I will add a form step.

00:23:17.456 --> 00:23:21.516 A:middle
So here's a form with its
identifier, and a title

00:23:21.516 --> 00:23:24.066 A:middle
and a general question: Over the
last two weeks how often have

00:23:24.066 --> 00:23:25.936 A:middle
you been bothered by any
of the following problems?

00:23:26.936 --> 00:23:29.546 A:middle
Now we are listing
problems and each one

00:23:29.546 --> 00:23:30.876 A:middle
of those problems
will be a form item.

00:23:31.566 --> 00:23:36.226 A:middle
So each of these problems
will be a question

00:23:36.396 --> 00:23:38.766 A:middle
that is a text choice
answer format.

00:23:38.766 --> 00:23:39.986 A:middle
So it's a multiple
choice question

00:23:40.336 --> 00:23:41.916 A:middle
where you can select
only one answer.

00:23:42.556 --> 00:23:45.456 A:middle
And you can see the answers I
have given here are not at all,

00:23:45.456 --> 00:23:47.736 A:middle
several days, more than half
the days and nearly every day

00:23:48.156 --> 00:23:50.156 A:middle
and they have corresponding
values as well

00:23:50.156 --> 00:23:51.856 A:middle
and these are the values
that will be encoded

00:23:51.856 --> 00:23:55.796 A:middle
into the result object so that
you can analyze the result later

00:23:55.796 --> 00:23:58.526 A:middle
and these could equally be any
value that's a property list

00:23:58.526 --> 00:24:00.786 A:middle
type, it could be an integer
-- an s-number, rather,



00:23:58.526 --> 00:24:00.786 A:middle
type, it could be an integer
-- an s-number, rather,

00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:04.226 A:middle
or it could be a
string like this.

00:24:04.416 --> 00:24:06.296 A:middle
So we have got this
interest item,

00:24:06.686 --> 00:24:08.526 A:middle
one problem I might have is
little interest or pleasure

00:24:08.526 --> 00:24:10.346 A:middle
in doing things and we will
add a couple more items

00:24:11.206 --> 00:24:12.766 A:middle
to round out our form.

00:24:13.336 --> 00:24:18.756 A:middle
So having set that up,
one more thing I want

00:24:18.756 --> 00:24:20.746 A:middle
to do is show you the
results and to do that,

00:24:20.956 --> 00:24:23.996 A:middle
I could have built you
some UI so we could look

00:24:23.996 --> 00:24:28.706 A:middle
through some results in the
app itself, and we actually do

00:24:28.706 --> 00:24:32.006 A:middle
that in the ORKCatalog
sample app on GitHub

00:24:32.356 --> 00:24:34.626 A:middle
but today I will just
serialize to JSON

00:24:34.676 --> 00:24:36.956 A:middle
and show you what the JSON
output might look like.

00:24:37.626 --> 00:24:40.276 A:middle
So to do that, we'll
go back here

00:24:40.276 --> 00:24:42.556 A:middle
to the task view controller
delegate DidFinishWithReason --

00:24:43.646 --> 00:24:44.846 A:middle
oops, it wanted one more step.

00:24:44.996 --> 00:24:47.976 A:middle
I'll just move that over.

00:24:47.976 --> 00:24:49.606 A:middle
I'll just add the
conclusion step to the task.

00:24:49.606 --> 00:24:50.846 A:middle
I forgot to do that.

00:24:52.326 --> 00:24:53.566 A:middle
So there's our conclusion step.

00:24:53.906 --> 00:24:54.776 A:middle
So switching back here.

00:24:54.776 --> 00:24:56.566 A:middle
I will be switching
on the reason.

00:24:57.526 --> 00:24:59.946 A:middle
So in the case that the task is
actually completed successfully,



00:25:00.146 --> 00:25:02.096 A:middle
I will extract the result
from the task view controller.

00:25:02.096 --> 00:25:04.476 A:middle
Then I will want to
serialize that to JSON

00:25:04.906 --> 00:25:08.736 A:middle
and the ResearchKit framework
itself does not include any JSON

00:25:08.736 --> 00:25:11.116 A:middle
serialization, we did
include something in one

00:25:11.116 --> 00:25:12.776 A:middle
of our test apps
in order to prove

00:25:12.776 --> 00:25:15.176 A:middle
that the JSON serialization
would work for a real app

00:25:15.666 --> 00:25:19.566 A:middle
and so I've included that here
now so I can demo it to you.

00:25:19.756 --> 00:25:22.586 A:middle
So I will run this and
show you what surveys look

00:25:22.586 --> 00:25:23.286 A:middle
like in ResearchKit.

00:25:31.776 --> 00:25:34.546 A:middle
So when I start my task,
I'm presented immediately

00:25:34.546 --> 00:25:35.476 A:middle
with this instruction step.

00:25:35.896 --> 00:25:37.926 A:middle
It has some indication
of progress.

00:25:38.136 --> 00:25:39.386 A:middle
I can cancel out of the task.

00:25:39.556 --> 00:25:42.836 A:middle
I've got my title and text and
I've got my navigation controls.

00:25:43.206 --> 00:25:45.246 A:middle
And you can see that it's been
prepopulated to get started

00:25:45.246 --> 00:25:46.996 A:middle
and that's automatic
from the framework set

00:25:46.996 --> 00:25:47.976 A:middle
up from the task
view controller.

00:25:48.946 --> 00:25:50.446 A:middle
When I come in I get
my boolean question,

00:25:50.646 --> 00:25:53.046 A:middle
I can choose my answer, If I
choose to skip this question,

00:25:53.216 --> 00:25:54.306 A:middle
the answer I entered
gets cleared.

00:25:54.306 --> 00:25:55.576 A:middle
So if I come back,
the answer is gone

00:25:56.206 --> 00:25:58.106 A:middle
and I can answer something
different when I come back.

00:25:59.156 --> 00:26:00.876 A:middle
So I'll just go through,
and give some answers,



00:25:59.156 --> 00:26:00.876 A:middle
So I'll just go through,
and give some answers,

00:26:01.296 --> 00:26:03.596 A:middle
and maybe I don't answer all the
questions and I can continue.

00:26:03.596 --> 00:26:05.356 A:middle
And finally, I'm done.

00:26:06.096 --> 00:26:10.576 A:middle
So let's take a look
at the results.

00:26:10.576 --> 00:26:13.556 A:middle
So as I described before,
we've got a task result here,

00:26:13.626 --> 00:26:14.456 A:middle
and it's got a start date

00:26:14.456 --> 00:26:16.346 A:middle
and an end date showing how
long we were actually looking

00:26:16.346 --> 00:26:16.876 A:middle
at that survey.

00:26:17.486 --> 00:26:19.736 A:middle
We've got an output
directory a task run UUID

00:26:19.736 --> 00:26:21.396 A:middle
that comes straight through
from the task view controller

00:26:21.756 --> 00:26:25.336 A:middle
and we've got the identifier
that came from the task.

00:26:25.496 --> 00:26:27.956 A:middle
The child results array contains
an array of step results.

00:26:28.186 --> 00:26:29.816 A:middle
So we have it instruction
step result

00:26:29.816 --> 00:26:32.416 A:middle
for that initial instruction
step that has no children

00:26:32.636 --> 00:26:34.586 A:middle
because we collected no
additional information

00:26:34.586 --> 00:26:35.076 A:middle
from the user.

00:26:36.396 --> 00:26:39.916 A:middle
In addition, we have
a question step result

00:26:39.916 --> 00:26:42.246 A:middle
which contains a Boolean
question result that contains

00:26:42.246 --> 00:26:43.676 A:middle
in the actual answer
to my question.

00:26:43.676 --> 00:26:44.806 A:middle
So in this case, I answered yes.

00:26:45.036 --> 00:26:50.066 A:middle
And then from the form step
here, we have a form step result

00:26:50.196 --> 00:26:53.096 A:middle
with the feeling form
identifier and then each

00:26:53.096 --> 00:26:54.236 A:middle
of the answers I entered.

00:26:54.236 --> 00:26:55.536 A:middle
I answered the first
two questions

00:26:55.836 --> 00:26:59.836 A:middle
and the final form item in
that form I didn't answer

00:26:59.836 --> 00:27:02.096 A:middle
and you can see there's no
actual answer property here



00:26:59.836 --> 00:27:02.096 A:middle
and you can see there's no
actual answer property here

00:27:03.566 --> 00:27:05.016 A:middle
and finally we have
another step result

00:27:05.016 --> 00:27:06.236 A:middle
for that closing
instruction step.

00:27:06.736 --> 00:27:10.726 A:middle
Now I will show you how easy it
is to modify the answer formats

00:27:10.726 --> 00:27:12.416 A:middle
if you need to change
things around in your survey

00:27:12.416 --> 00:27:16.526 A:middle
as you develop your app.

00:27:16.796 --> 00:27:18.536 A:middle
One thing I might want to
do is change is my boolean

00:27:18.536 --> 00:27:19.156 A:middle
answer format.

00:27:19.536 --> 00:27:21.486 A:middle
Maybe yes isn't enough
information.

00:27:21.486 --> 00:27:23.426 A:middle
Maybe my health is limited a lot

00:27:23.426 --> 00:27:25.736 A:middle
or maybe it's limited
only a little and so to do

00:27:25.736 --> 00:27:27.656 A:middle
that I can switch to a
text choice answer format

00:27:28.066 --> 00:27:30.966 A:middle
and provide some detailed text
on each choice which allows me

00:27:30.966 --> 00:27:34.136 A:middle
to qualify the overall answers,
so I can have yes, limited a lot

00:27:34.136 --> 00:27:37.446 A:middle
or yes, limited a little.

00:27:37.446 --> 00:27:41.186 A:middle
One other thing you'll notice
here is the exclusive setting,

00:27:41.536 --> 00:27:44.186 A:middle
which if this were a multiple
choice question would allow you

00:27:44.186 --> 00:27:46.756 A:middle
to set one or more choices
as being an exclusive choice.

00:27:46.756 --> 00:27:48.636 A:middle
If you selected that choice
all the other choices would

00:27:48.636 --> 00:27:49.246 A:middle
be deselected.

00:27:49.596 --> 00:27:52.346 A:middle
I might also want to
change my form step.

00:27:52.746 --> 00:27:55.536 A:middle
So as you saw, that was a very
long, vertically scrolling form

00:27:55.536 --> 00:27:56.966 A:middle
and maybe that's not
what I want in my app.

00:27:57.366 --> 00:27:59.876 A:middle
Perhaps I'd like to have
some horizontal slidders

00:27:59.876 --> 00:28:02.496 A:middle
that I could use to display
more or less the same content,



00:27:59.876 --> 00:28:02.496 A:middle
that I could use to display
more or less the same content,

00:28:02.816 --> 00:28:06.156 A:middle
get the same answer, but in
a different presentation.

00:28:06.346 --> 00:28:09.166 A:middle
I can do that very easily in
ResearchKit just by switching

00:28:09.166 --> 00:28:11.926 A:middle
to the ORKScale format and
specifying descriptions

00:28:12.226 --> 00:28:13.856 A:middle
for the minimum and
the maximum values.

00:28:14.696 --> 00:28:17.646 A:middle
So I will run that again and
show what you that looks like.

00:28:21.216 --> 00:28:22.466 A:middle
Here's our survey again.

00:28:22.956 --> 00:28:23.586 A:middle
Very similar.

00:28:23.986 --> 00:28:25.636 A:middle
And now we have got some
different options here

00:28:25.636 --> 00:28:26.156 A:middle
in this step.

00:28:27.156 --> 00:28:32.016 A:middle
And what used to be multiple
choice questions are now sliders

00:28:32.016 --> 00:28:33.296 A:middle
that I can use to
adjust the value.

00:28:35.536 --> 00:28:37.576 A:middle
When I come through and
look at the results,

00:28:38.196 --> 00:28:41.426 A:middle
the results are very similar
in structure but the types

00:28:41.426 --> 00:28:42.356 A:middle
of results are different,

00:28:42.676 --> 00:28:44.856 A:middle
because the corresponding
answer formats are different.

00:28:44.916 --> 00:28:46.996 A:middle
So your interpretation of those
results would need to change.

00:28:47.436 --> 00:28:49.696 A:middle
So that's surveys
in ResearchKit.

00:28:51.516 --> 00:28:57.156 A:middle
[Applause]

00:28:57.656 --> 00:28:59.326 A:middle
So the second module
in informed consent --

00:28:59.526 --> 00:29:02.006 A:middle
the second module in
ResearchKit is informed consent.



00:28:59.526 --> 00:29:02.006 A:middle
the second module in
ResearchKit is informed consent.

00:29:03.366 --> 00:29:04.546 A:middle
So we will look at that now.

00:29:04.876 --> 00:29:08.946 A:middle
So what is informed consent?

00:29:10.486 --> 00:29:12.376 A:middle
Informed consent is
the process of ensuring

00:29:12.376 --> 00:29:14.596 A:middle
that participants fully
understand the why

00:29:14.596 --> 00:29:15.536 A:middle
and the how of the study.

00:29:16.206 --> 00:29:18.956 A:middle
What does the study
entail and also the risks

00:29:18.956 --> 00:29:20.136 A:middle
and benefits of participation.

00:29:20.686 --> 00:29:22.916 A:middle
Now, this will often
be conducted in person.

00:29:24.206 --> 00:29:26.596 A:middle
And the detailed
requirements of what needs to go

00:29:26.596 --> 00:29:28.706 A:middle
into your consent
process will come both

00:29:28.706 --> 00:29:31.366 A:middle
from your study protocol and
from your ethics review process.

00:29:31.586 --> 00:29:36.646 A:middle
Now, as the participant and the
investigator review the consent

00:29:36.646 --> 00:29:39.836 A:middle
together, they will
often initial each page

00:29:39.946 --> 00:29:41.856 A:middle
and perhaps sign at the end.

00:29:42.596 --> 00:29:44.736 A:middle
And so you probably need to
sign during your informed

00:29:44.736 --> 00:29:45.456 A:middle
consent process.

00:29:45.886 --> 00:29:49.326 A:middle
And finally, this informed
consent is usually a

00:29:49.326 --> 00:29:49.936 A:middle
legal document.

00:29:50.446 --> 00:29:54.396 A:middle
Now App Store submissions

00:29:54.396 --> 00:29:57.586 A:middle
for human subject research
must now include evidence

00:29:57.586 --> 00:29:58.886 A:middle
of some form of ethical review.

00:29:59.796 --> 00:30:01.766 A:middle
That doesn't necessarily
mean that you need



00:29:59.796 --> 00:30:01.766 A:middle
That doesn't necessarily
mean that you need

00:30:01.766 --> 00:30:03.436 A:middle
to include an informed
consent process

00:30:03.436 --> 00:30:05.106 A:middle
like the one we will
be discussing as part

00:30:05.106 --> 00:30:06.886 A:middle
of this ResearchKit
informed consent module.

00:30:07.486 --> 00:30:10.146 A:middle
Because low-risk
studies might be exempted

00:30:10.146 --> 00:30:11.476 A:middle
from informed consent

00:30:11.746 --> 00:30:14.266 A:middle
and certain high-risk
studies may actually need

00:30:14.266 --> 00:30:15.996 A:middle
to work in person.

00:30:15.996 --> 00:30:18.176 A:middle
But in many cases, the
informed consent module

00:30:18.176 --> 00:30:19.766 A:middle
in ResearchKit will
be appropriate.

00:30:20.536 --> 00:30:22.336 A:middle
And you will be able to
determine that during the course

00:30:22.336 --> 00:30:23.456 A:middle
of your ethical review process.

00:30:25.856 --> 00:30:27.586 A:middle
So assuming ResearchKit
can help,

00:30:27.916 --> 00:30:30.106 A:middle
let's look at how the
informed consent module works.

00:30:30.656 --> 00:30:37.156 A:middle
So there are two steps in
ResearchKit for informed consent

00:30:37.316 --> 00:30:38.416 A:middle
which need to present consent

00:30:38.506 --> 00:30:39.636 A:middle
from the informed
consent document.

00:30:40.356 --> 00:30:42.906 A:middle
And so both of those
steps get their content

00:30:42.956 --> 00:30:44.526 A:middle
from the ORKConsent document.

00:30:44.526 --> 00:30:46.586 A:middle
And this consent document
is made up of two arrays.

00:30:47.066 --> 00:30:48.636 A:middle
The first array is
an array of sections

00:30:48.636 --> 00:30:50.666 A:middle
and these sections might
be of predefined types

00:30:50.956 --> 00:30:52.706 A:middle
like data gathering,
privacy, and data use,

00:30:52.926 --> 00:30:55.136 A:middle
which are the types of
sections you might expect to see

00:30:55.136 --> 00:30:56.196 A:middle
in an informed consent document.

00:30:56.836 --> 00:30:58.436 A:middle
But they also might
be custom sections.

00:30:58.766 --> 00:31:02.106 A:middle
So ResearchKit doesn't intend
to provide a full solution,



00:30:58.766 --> 00:31:02.106 A:middle
So ResearchKit doesn't intend
to provide a full solution,

00:31:02.256 --> 00:31:03.516 A:middle
we provide an 80% solution.

00:31:03.516 --> 00:31:06.016 A:middle
And for your app, if you
need additional sections,

00:31:06.016 --> 00:31:07.526 A:middle
you should add them.

00:31:07.846 --> 00:31:10.726 A:middle
In addition the consent
document will have an array

00:31:10.726 --> 00:31:11.856 A:middle
of signatures.

00:31:12.186 --> 00:31:13.796 A:middle
So we might have an
investigative signature

00:31:13.796 --> 00:31:15.906 A:middle
that contains a prepopulated
name and image

00:31:15.906 --> 00:31:20.866 A:middle
and a participant signature
where we collect the name

00:31:20.866 --> 00:31:23.096 A:middle
and image during the course
of the consent review process.

00:31:24.856 --> 00:31:29.006 A:middle
So let's see how these
look in ResearchKit.

00:31:29.066 --> 00:31:32.926 A:middle
We have got the visual consent
step, the consent sharing step

00:31:32.926 --> 00:31:35.816 A:middle
and the consent review step
and I will dive into those each

00:31:35.856 --> 00:31:37.326 A:middle
in a little bit more detail.

00:31:39.296 --> 00:31:42.366 A:middle
The visual consent flow
typically has one screen per

00:31:42.366 --> 00:31:43.246 A:middle
section in the document.

00:31:43.786 --> 00:31:46.126 A:middle
It has neat animated transitions
that I'll show you in a demo

00:31:46.126 --> 00:31:47.936 A:middle
in a minute for the
predefined sections

00:31:48.156 --> 00:31:50.666 A:middle
and it's fully customizable,
so you can replace the imagery,

00:31:50.896 --> 00:31:54.426 A:middle
you can replace the
animations and you can fill

00:31:54.426 --> 00:31:56.286 A:middle
in the exact content from
your consent document.

00:31:56.966 --> 00:31:58.196 A:middle
So let's look at how
you do that in code.

00:31:59.136 --> 00:32:01.186 A:middle
You'll create a consent
section of a particular type,



00:31:59.136 --> 00:32:01.186 A:middle
You'll create a consent
section of a particular type,

00:32:01.366 --> 00:32:02.516 A:middle
so in this case, data gathering.

00:32:03.856 --> 00:32:05.916 A:middle
Then, you'll set
some properties.

00:32:06.126 --> 00:32:07.626 A:middle
In this case I didn't
need to set a title

00:32:07.726 --> 00:32:09.166 A:middle
because that would have
already been localized

00:32:09.166 --> 00:32:10.256 A:middle
to all the languages in iOS

00:32:10.256 --> 00:32:11.746 A:middle
because I chose a
predefined section,

00:32:12.366 --> 00:32:14.916 A:middle
but if I didn't use a
predefined section or if I need

00:32:14.916 --> 00:32:17.196 A:middle
to specify my own, then I
can override them like this.

00:32:18.116 --> 00:32:20.676 A:middle
I can specify a summary which is
shown during the visual consent

00:32:20.676 --> 00:32:23.676 A:middle
process and I can specify
some content which is shown

00:32:23.676 --> 00:32:25.866 A:middle
if the user taps learn more as
they go through visual consent

00:32:26.406 --> 00:32:28.996 A:middle
or if you are going
through the whole document

00:32:28.996 --> 00:32:30.486 A:middle
which is displayed
in consent review.

00:32:33.016 --> 00:32:34.936 A:middle
In addition, you can set
a couple of other things,

00:32:35.376 --> 00:32:37.786 A:middle
so you can set a custom
image or custom animation.

00:32:37.976 --> 00:32:40.116 A:middle
This custom animation
is just a video file

00:32:40.116 --> 00:32:41.206 A:middle
that you might include
with your app

00:32:42.306 --> 00:32:44.046 A:middle
which would override
whatever the default is,

00:32:44.106 --> 00:32:48.026 A:middle
or provide something new,
if it's a custom step type.

00:32:48.226 --> 00:32:49.486 A:middle
Once you have the
consent section,

00:32:49.746 --> 00:32:53.946 A:middle
you attach your document
to a visual consent step

00:32:53.946 --> 00:32:55.536 A:middle
to present your visual
consent sequence.

00:32:55.536 --> 00:33:00.666 A:middle
The next step in the informed
consent module is the consent



00:32:55.536 --> 00:33:00.666 A:middle
The next step in the informed
consent module is the consent

00:33:00.666 --> 00:33:01.216 A:middle
sharing step.

00:33:02.466 --> 00:33:03.876 A:middle
Research data collection
is hard work.

00:33:03.876 --> 00:33:05.156 A:middle
So it makes sense to reuse it

00:33:05.156 --> 00:33:06.976 A:middle
across multiple studies
when that's possible.

00:33:07.516 --> 00:33:10.396 A:middle
So it often makes sense
to obtain a broad consent

00:33:10.716 --> 00:33:12.566 A:middle
that will allow you to share
the data that you collect

00:33:13.036 --> 00:33:13.846 A:middle
with other researchers.

00:33:15.006 --> 00:33:16.876 A:middle
But that can pose a
problem for participants.

00:33:17.676 --> 00:33:19.866 A:middle
If the data is really sensitive
they might want to contribute

00:33:19.866 --> 00:33:21.076 A:middle
to your study but not to others.

00:33:22.366 --> 00:33:24.606 A:middle
This issue came up while we
were developing the initial apps

00:33:24.606 --> 00:33:27.286 A:middle
using ResearchKit and so

00:33:27.436 --> 00:33:29.386 A:middle
as a result we created
the consent sharing step

00:33:29.646 --> 00:33:31.396 A:middle
which has been prelocalized
to all the languages

00:33:31.396 --> 00:33:33.396 A:middle
that iOS supports
where we can substitute

00:33:33.396 --> 00:33:35.816 A:middle
in just your institution name
and a couple other details

00:33:36.326 --> 00:33:38.156 A:middle
to allow you to ask
this question

00:33:38.536 --> 00:33:40.026 A:middle
of participants whether
they would

00:33:40.026 --> 00:33:41.326 A:middle
like to share their
data more widely.

00:33:46.196 --> 00:33:48.216 A:middle
Over 80% of participants

00:33:48.216 --> 00:33:50.026 A:middle
in these initial studies
have actually said yes

00:33:50.026 --> 00:33:52.606 A:middle
to this question but we still
think it's an important thing

00:33:52.606 --> 00:33:55.796 A:middle
to include if you are looking
at such a broad consent.

00:33:56.546 --> 00:33:58.456 A:middle
So that's consent sharing step.

00:33:59.066 --> 00:33:59.696 A:middle
The final step

00:33:59.776 --> 00:34:03.556 A:middle
in the ResearchKit informed
consent module is the consent



00:33:59.776 --> 00:34:03.556 A:middle
in the ResearchKit informed
consent module is the consent

00:34:03.556 --> 00:34:06.266 A:middle
review step and here the
participant reviews the actual

00:34:06.266 --> 00:34:08.505 A:middle
document and possibly
enters their name

00:34:08.505 --> 00:34:09.985 A:middle
and maybe signs with
their finger.

00:34:10.416 --> 00:34:12.386 A:middle
And to show you how
that works in code,

00:34:12.386 --> 00:34:14.146 A:middle
we will look at that next.

00:34:14.146 --> 00:34:16.726 A:middle
You might start with your
consent document here

00:34:16.726 --> 00:34:18.576 A:middle
and then you'll need
to add a signature

00:34:19.085 --> 00:34:20.396 A:middle
which is the signature
you want to collect.

00:34:20.636 --> 00:34:22.016 A:middle
So this is the participant
signature.

00:34:22.356 --> 00:34:23.676 A:middle
You set the title
for the participant

00:34:23.676 --> 00:34:25.386 A:middle
which is wat goes beneath the
signature line if you were

00:34:25.386 --> 00:34:26.835 A:middle
to generate a PDF
of the document.

00:34:27.466 --> 00:34:29.706 A:middle
And we've got an
identifier which identifies

00:34:29.706 --> 00:34:32.806 A:middle
which signature this
is if we are trying

00:34:32.806 --> 00:34:34.846 A:middle
to find a particular signature
in the consent document.

00:34:35.356 --> 00:34:41.005 A:middle
You can turn off either
the name collection

00:34:41.005 --> 00:34:42.525 A:middle
or the signature
image collection,

00:34:43.386 --> 00:34:45.295 A:middle
in this case we're
turning off the

00:34:45.376 --> 00:34:47.556 A:middle
by setting
RequiresSignatureImage to false.

00:34:50.096 --> 00:34:52.516 A:middle
Then you'll add the signature
to your consent document

00:34:53.186 --> 00:34:55.266 A:middle
and you will attach
your consent document

00:34:55.266 --> 00:34:58.546 A:middle
to a consent review step while
also specifying what signature

00:34:58.546 --> 00:35:00.986 A:middle
it is that you are
trying to collect.



00:34:58.546 --> 00:35:00.986 A:middle
it is that you are
trying to collect.

00:35:00.986 --> 00:35:02.736 A:middle
You can use more than
one consent review step

00:35:02.736 --> 00:35:04.976 A:middle
if you have more than one person
reviewing the same document

00:35:04.976 --> 00:35:06.396 A:middle
on the same device,
which might happen

00:35:06.396 --> 00:35:07.346 A:middle
if you are doing this in person.

00:35:07.886 --> 00:35:13.106 A:middle
So those are the steps that make
up the informed consent module

00:35:13.106 --> 00:35:15.756 A:middle
in ResearchKit but to really
understand what this means

00:35:15.816 --> 00:35:17.746 A:middle
when you are running through the
app, I need to show you a demo.

00:35:17.746 --> 00:35:18.976 A:middle
So we will do that next.

00:35:28.046 --> 00:35:31.906 A:middle
So to begin doing the
informed consent in code,

00:35:32.226 --> 00:35:33.956 A:middle
we'll need to start by
creating a consent document.

00:35:33.956 --> 00:35:35.566 A:middle
So I will do that first.

00:35:35.566 --> 00:35:36.576 A:middle
Here's my consent document

00:35:37.186 --> 00:35:39.286 A:middle
and the first thing I'll
need some consent sections

00:35:39.286 --> 00:35:40.606 A:middle
to display during
the visual consent.

00:35:41.626 --> 00:35:43.816 A:middle
So here I've created an
array of consent sections

00:35:44.146 --> 00:35:46.046 A:middle
and created a consent
section of TypeOverview

00:35:46.316 --> 00:35:47.216 A:middle
on which I set a summary.

00:35:47.286 --> 00:35:48.936 A:middle
I don't need to set the title

00:35:48.936 --> 00:35:51.076 A:middle
because that's already been
propopulated from my language.

00:35:54.966 --> 00:35:57.506 A:middle
I'll also want to add some more
sections so you can see some

00:35:57.506 --> 00:35:59.966 A:middle
of these animations, so I'll
add a data gathering section



00:36:00.376 --> 00:36:03.806 A:middle
and a privacy section, each
with some lorem ipsum text.

00:36:05.416 --> 00:36:09.846 A:middle
In addition, I'll want to show
you how you add actual content

00:36:09.846 --> 00:36:10.796 A:middle
to your consent document.

00:36:10.796 --> 00:36:12.746 A:middle
So the consent that would
go within the section

00:36:12.746 --> 00:36:16.506 A:middle
in the consent review document
or also what you would find

00:36:16.506 --> 00:36:17.436 A:middle
if you tapped learn more

00:36:17.436 --> 00:36:19.816 A:middle
from a particular
visual consent section.

00:36:19.946 --> 00:36:22.276 A:middle
You can specify the
content property directly,

00:36:22.476 --> 00:36:25.486 A:middle
which is just text, or you
could specify some HTML

00:36:25.726 --> 00:36:27.926 A:middle
if that's what you wanted,
so I'll leave the HTML in.

00:36:28.346 --> 00:36:30.266 A:middle
So those are my consent
sections,

00:36:31.076 --> 00:36:32.426 A:middle
Additionally I will
need some signatures

00:36:32.426 --> 00:36:33.496 A:middle
for the consent review step.

00:36:34.226 --> 00:36:35.696 A:middle
So I'll add a participant
signature,

00:36:36.606 --> 00:36:38.586 A:middle
just like the code I showed
you before on the slides

00:36:38.926 --> 00:36:41.936 A:middle
and the investigator signature
with a different title

00:36:42.076 --> 00:36:45.266 A:middle
and a different identifier,
with a name

00:36:45.266 --> 00:36:46.666 A:middle
and an image prepopulated.

00:36:47.006 --> 00:36:49.506 A:middle
And I've added those to
the consent document.

00:36:50.456 --> 00:36:52.226 A:middle
Then, once I have
my consent document,

00:36:52.756 --> 00:36:55.866 A:middle
I'll need to create a task to
display this consent process.

00:36:56.366 --> 00:36:58.766 A:middle
So here's my consent task,
with the identifier Consent,

00:36:59.136 --> 00:37:00.856 A:middle
I've just chosen that because
it's different from Survey



00:36:59.136 --> 00:37:00.856 A:middle
I've just chosen that because
it's different from Survey

00:37:00.856 --> 00:37:03.156 A:middle
and it's something that I can
understand when I read it.

00:37:03.856 --> 00:37:06.236 A:middle
So I've got an array of steps
which is currently empty

00:37:06.406 --> 00:37:08.366 A:middle
and the first thing I'll want
is a visual consent step.

00:37:08.366 --> 00:37:11.996 A:middle
So I will add that here and this
has the identifier VisualConsent

00:37:11.996 --> 00:37:14.156 A:middle
and I pass the document
from my computed property.

00:37:15.236 --> 00:37:18.116 A:middle
Next, I'll want to show you
the consent sharing step,

00:37:19.136 --> 00:37:21.216 A:middle
with just a few properties
that I have to set in order

00:37:21.216 --> 00:37:22.186 A:middle
to fully populate the text.

00:37:22.186 --> 00:37:27.756 A:middle
And last, we will want
a consent review step

00:37:28.136 --> 00:37:29.456 A:middle
where the participant
has an opportunity

00:37:29.456 --> 00:37:32.486 A:middle
to enter their signature and
review their overall document.

00:37:33.026 --> 00:37:34.446 A:middle
So here I grab the
first signature

00:37:34.446 --> 00:37:35.906 A:middle
from the consent
document, which I happen

00:37:35.906 --> 00:37:37.656 A:middle
to know is the participant
signature,

00:37:38.246 --> 00:37:40.176 A:middle
and the consent document
itself and attach them

00:37:40.176 --> 00:37:41.256 A:middle
to this consent review step

00:37:41.646 --> 00:37:43.826 A:middle
with another unique
identifier within this task.

00:37:44.886 --> 00:37:46.776 A:middle
There are a couple of things
I can additionally customize

00:37:46.776 --> 00:37:49.126 A:middle
on the consent review step
like the text that is displayed

00:37:49.126 --> 00:37:51.206 A:middle
as the user enters their name
and the text that's displayed

00:37:51.206 --> 00:37:52.776 A:middle
in the confirmation
dialog when they agree.

00:37:53.456 --> 00:37:55.316 A:middle
And I've added all these
steps to my step array.

00:37:56.206 --> 00:38:07.316 A:middle
Then I'll justneed to extend my
table view to display that task.



00:37:56.206 --> 00:38:07.316 A:middle
Then I'll justneed to extend my
table view to display that task.

00:38:07.426 --> 00:38:12.786 A:middle
And specify that that's the
actual task I want to display

00:38:12.786 --> 00:38:14.896 A:middle
and I'll show you
the consent process.

00:38:20.476 --> 00:38:23.926 A:middle
So when I start my informed
consent task now we jump

00:38:23.926 --> 00:38:25.306 A:middle
straight into the
visual consent step.

00:38:25.906 --> 00:38:27.756 A:middle
And in contrast to some of
the other steps we've seen,

00:38:27.946 --> 00:38:30.836 A:middle
this visual consent step
has multiple screens

00:38:30.836 --> 00:38:31.426 A:middle
for each section.

00:38:31.726 --> 00:38:34.146 A:middle
So this corresponds to the first
section in my consent document.

00:38:35.216 --> 00:38:37.586 A:middle
When I navigate to the second,
I get this beautiful animation

00:38:38.346 --> 00:38:40.646 A:middle
as I transition from
one screen to the next.

00:38:41.916 --> 00:38:44.106 A:middle
These animations are the
predefined animations

00:38:44.106 --> 00:38:46.386 A:middle
that I was talking about.

00:38:46.386 --> 00:38:49.056 A:middle
NowYou can further customize
this screen, for instance,

00:38:49.056 --> 00:38:50.986 A:middle
in order to make it
fit in with your app.

00:38:51.346 --> 00:38:53.256 A:middle
If you set the tint
color using UIAppearance

00:38:53.616 --> 00:38:55.896 A:middle
that would override both
these controls at the top

00:38:55.896 --> 00:38:57.646 A:middle
of the screen and the
next button down here

00:38:57.826 --> 00:38:59.756 A:middle
and actually change the
tint color of this image

00:38:59.756 --> 00:39:02.136 A:middle
and the corresponding
animation so it can fit nicely



00:38:59.756 --> 00:39:02.136 A:middle
and the corresponding
animation so it can fit nicely

00:39:02.136 --> 00:39:03.136 A:middle
into whatever app
you're building.

00:39:04.506 --> 00:39:05.876 A:middle
As I proceed to my next section,

00:39:06.236 --> 00:39:07.636 A:middle
you'll see I've got this
"Learn more" button.

00:39:07.966 --> 00:39:10.846 A:middle
And when I tap that "Learn more"
I can see the actual content

00:39:10.846 --> 00:39:12.196 A:middle
from the particular
consent document.

00:39:12.686 --> 00:39:16.956 A:middle
As I proceed, I'll come on
to the consent sharing step

00:39:16.956 --> 00:39:18.256 A:middle
and this is really
just a question step

00:39:18.466 --> 00:39:20.206 A:middle
where I'm asked whether
I want to share data just

00:39:20.206 --> 00:39:22.516 A:middle
with your institution or
with researchers worldwide.

00:39:22.806 --> 00:39:25.556 A:middle
And I want to share my
data with all researchers

00:39:25.556 --> 00:39:26.426 A:middle
that you think are qualified.

00:39:27.256 --> 00:39:30.046 A:middle
And as you continue, I see
this consent review step

00:39:30.046 --> 00:39:31.226 A:middle
which summarizes the document.

00:39:31.226 --> 00:39:34.356 A:middle
I have got the titles for each
of the sections and the content

00:39:34.356 --> 00:39:36.516 A:middle
for each section and I only
set the content for one section

00:39:36.746 --> 00:39:39.306 A:middle
but if you set them for all of
those for the particular consent

00:39:39.306 --> 00:39:43.066 A:middle
for your consent document, this
would be a full legal document

00:39:43.066 --> 00:39:44.896 A:middle
that the user might
be agreeing to.

00:39:46.416 --> 00:39:48.766 A:middle
Now, sometimes the
sections you want to show

00:39:48.766 --> 00:39:50.586 A:middle
in this document will be
different from what you want

00:39:50.586 --> 00:39:52.916 A:middle
to show in the visual
consent and you can accomplish

00:39:52.916 --> 00:39:54.526 A:middle
that easily in ResearchKit
either

00:39:54.526 --> 00:39:57.406 A:middle
by using only in-document
sections, which will only appear

00:39:57.406 --> 00:39:58.356 A:middle
in this consent review step

00:39:58.806 --> 00:40:01.096 A:middle
or by using a completely
different consent document



00:39:58.806 --> 00:40:01.096 A:middle
or by using a completely
different consent document

00:40:01.096 --> 00:40:03.616 A:middle
object to represent
this or a third option,

00:40:03.956 --> 00:40:05.826 A:middle
you could set the
HTML review content

00:40:06.036 --> 00:40:08.786 A:middle
which completely supplies
your own HTML to display

00:40:08.786 --> 00:40:11.876 A:middle
in this consent review if you
need complete customization.

00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:17.036 A:middle
Once I agree, you will see
whatever custom text I provided

00:40:17.696 --> 00:40:18.876 A:middle
and I will enter my name.

00:40:22.996 --> 00:40:25.906 A:middle
Continue. I might sign,
which I won't do very well.

00:40:26.546 --> 00:40:28.476 A:middle
And finally when I
complete the task,

00:40:28.846 --> 00:40:29.906 A:middle
you'll get back a result just

00:40:29.906 --> 00:40:31.496 A:middle
like for any other
task in ResearchKit.

00:40:31.736 --> 00:40:34.266 A:middle
And this has a step
result corresponding

00:40:34.266 --> 00:40:35.906 A:middle
to the visual consent
showing how long it was

00:40:35.906 --> 00:40:37.456 A:middle
that I was looking at the
visual consent process.

00:40:38.746 --> 00:40:42.976 A:middle
A step result for that sharing
question step with an answer

00:40:42.976 --> 00:40:44.416 A:middle
of true because I answered yes.

00:40:45.136 --> 00:40:49.246 A:middle
And you will see a result for
that final consent review step

00:40:49.536 --> 00:40:52.296 A:middle
that includes the data for the
actual signature that I entered.

00:40:52.296 --> 00:40:55.266 A:middle
So my name, and if I were
looking at the actual object

00:40:55.266 --> 00:40:59.116 A:middle
in Swift then I'd be able to
pull out the actual UI image

00:40:59.146 --> 00:41:01.756 A:middle
to the signature that I drew.



00:40:59.146 --> 00:41:01.756 A:middle
to the signature that I drew.

00:41:01.946 --> 00:41:04.316 A:middle
So that's informed
consent in ResearchKit.

00:41:04.316 --> 00:41:06.886 A:middle
Now there are a couple
of other things we need

00:41:06.886 --> 00:41:10.726 A:middle
to cover before we move
on that are worth noting

00:41:10.726 --> 00:41:13.046 A:middle
about this informed consent
process that we learned

00:41:13.046 --> 00:41:14.686 A:middle
in developing these
initial apps.

00:41:14.686 --> 00:41:16.456 A:middle
I will divide them
into two categories.

00:41:16.956 --> 00:41:18.976 A:middle
The first category
is the informed part.

00:41:21.036 --> 00:41:23.306 A:middle
The first part of
this is form factor.

00:41:24.336 --> 00:41:27.376 A:middle
We have tried to make the
visual consent work really well

00:41:27.376 --> 00:41:28.686 A:middle
adapting your consent document

00:41:28.936 --> 00:41:31.616 A:middle
to this smaller iPhone
form factor.

00:41:33.416 --> 00:41:35.046 A:middle
However, for your
app, you may need

00:41:35.046 --> 00:41:37.086 A:middle
to add additional custom
content and when do you that,

00:41:37.426 --> 00:41:37.986 A:middle
you just try and make

00:41:37.986 --> 00:41:40.246 A:middle
that content fit well
on these devices.

00:41:40.686 --> 00:41:44.946 A:middle
Next, we really encourage
you to use custom sections.

00:41:45.656 --> 00:41:47.436 A:middle
What we put in ResearchKit
is only there

00:41:47.746 --> 00:41:48.946 A:middle
in an advisory fashion.

00:41:49.376 --> 00:41:53.046 A:middle
We want you to actually
represent what you need,

00:41:53.046 --> 00:41:55.766 A:middle
what comes out of
your ethical --

00:41:55.926 --> 00:41:57.076 A:middle
of your ethics review process.

00:41:59.186 --> 00:42:01.116 A:middle
Next, you should plan
for accepting questions



00:41:59.186 --> 00:42:01.116 A:middle
Next, you should plan
for accepting questions

00:42:01.116 --> 00:42:03.696 A:middle
from participants, whether
during the consent process,

00:42:03.756 --> 00:42:05.376 A:middle
that is, before the
user has fully consented

00:42:05.776 --> 00:42:08.226 A:middle
and afterward once they have
actually joined your study.

00:42:08.226 --> 00:42:09.626 A:middle
Maybe they will have
more questions once they

00:42:09.626 --> 00:42:10.366 A:middle
start participating.

00:42:10.886 --> 00:42:13.196 A:middle
And finally many of the apps

00:42:13.196 --> 00:42:16.156 A:middle
that are already using
ResearchKit have incorporated a

00:42:16.826 --> 00:42:18.126 A:middle
comprehension quiz.

00:42:18.126 --> 00:42:21.356 A:middle
Now, this can be a
bit of an extra load,

00:42:21.656 --> 00:42:23.566 A:middle
but it can also give you
a lot more peace of mind

00:42:23.566 --> 00:42:25.456 A:middle
that participants really
understand what it is

00:42:25.456 --> 00:42:27.536 A:middle
that you are trying to convey to
them during this visual consent.

00:42:28.656 --> 00:42:31.336 A:middle
And to do that, you can
just use the same steps

00:42:31.336 --> 00:42:35.206 A:middle
from the surveys module and
mix them into your consent task

00:42:35.466 --> 00:42:36.966 A:middle
in order to accomplish
that kind of behavior.

00:42:37.536 --> 00:42:40.876 A:middle
On the other side,
we have got consent.

00:42:40.876 --> 00:42:42.826 A:middle
And there are a couple
of points here.

00:42:43.816 --> 00:42:45.406 A:middle
One is verifying identity.

00:42:46.006 --> 00:42:47.446 A:middle
ResearchKit itself
doesn't do anything

00:42:47.446 --> 00:42:50.426 A:middle
to actually verify the
identity of your participants,

00:42:50.736 --> 00:42:53.256 A:middle
but the initial apps using
ResearchKit actually did some

00:42:53.256 --> 00:42:55.076 A:middle
form of email verification
to make sure

00:42:55.076 --> 00:42:58.896 A:middle
that they were actually talking
to a person, but for your study,

00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:01.026 A:middle
possibly coming out of
your ethics review process,



00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:01.026 A:middle
possibly coming out of
your ethics review process,

00:43:01.236 --> 00:43:03.116 A:middle
you may need either
less or more than that.

00:43:03.116 --> 00:43:05.006 A:middle
For instance, you may need
to use a third party service

00:43:05.006 --> 00:43:06.636 A:middle
to identify identity
more robustly.

00:43:07.766 --> 00:43:10.236 A:middle
And once you have a concept
of identity, you probably want

00:43:10.236 --> 00:43:12.636 A:middle
to tie that identity with the
actual record of that consent,

00:43:13.036 --> 00:43:14.806 A:middle
in which case it might
make sense to use some form

00:43:14.806 --> 00:43:15.716 A:middle
of cryptographic signature.

00:43:16.276 --> 00:43:18.756 A:middle
So that's informed consent.

00:43:21.096 --> 00:43:24.846 A:middle
The third module in
ResearchKit is active tasks.

00:43:28.436 --> 00:43:31.256 A:middle
An active task is a
semicontrolled test

00:43:31.976 --> 00:43:34.076 A:middle
in which the participant is
given step-by-step instructions

00:43:34.076 --> 00:43:36.586 A:middle
to perform the task while data
is collected using sensors

00:43:36.586 --> 00:43:36.996 A:middle
on the device.

00:43:37.706 --> 00:43:39.586 A:middle
And the key properties
of such tasks are

00:43:39.706 --> 00:43:42.036 A:middle
that they're interactive
and very short in duration.

00:43:42.096 --> 00:43:43.946 A:middle
So these are session-based
tasks.

00:43:44.536 --> 00:43:47.026 A:middle
The longest task in one of
the ResearchKit apps so far is

00:43:47.026 --> 00:43:49.316 A:middle
about six minutes and most
of these tasks are about one

00:43:49.316 --> 00:43:50.246 A:middle
or two minutes in duration.

00:43:52.586 --> 00:43:54.466 A:middle
Let's look at the
structure in some

00:43:54.466 --> 00:43:56.056 A:middle
of the predefined
tasks in ResearchKit.

00:43:58.676 --> 00:44:02.146 A:middle
These tasks typically have a
couple of instruction steps



00:43:58.676 --> 00:44:02.146 A:middle
These tasks typically have a
couple of instruction steps

00:44:02.146 --> 00:44:05.686 A:middle
to introduce you to the task
basically tell you what it's

00:44:05.686 --> 00:44:07.336 A:middle
about, and then what
you will need to do.

00:44:07.936 --> 00:44:10.396 A:middle
Then some kind of introduction
to get you ready to act,

00:44:10.396 --> 00:44:13.936 A:middle
and then an active step
in which data is actually

00:44:13.936 --> 00:44:14.486 A:middle
being collected.

00:44:15.076 --> 00:44:17.456 A:middle
And finally when the task is
complete, we will thank you

00:44:17.456 --> 00:44:18.246 A:middle
for your participation.

00:44:18.356 --> 00:44:22.646 A:middle
What makes this an active
task is the existence

00:44:22.646 --> 00:44:23.356 A:middle
of the active step.

00:44:24.076 --> 00:44:26.086 A:middle
And the active step here is
really a base class in each

00:44:26.086 --> 00:44:29.316 A:middle
of the individual active
tasks that we predefined,

00:44:29.586 --> 00:44:32.886 A:middle
subclasses that to produce the
special behaviors that we need

00:44:32.886 --> 00:44:34.566 A:middle
for each of these tasks.

00:44:34.566 --> 00:44:36.916 A:middle
Now, when we released
ResearchKit,

00:44:37.276 --> 00:44:38.446 A:middle
there were five active tasks.

00:44:39.556 --> 00:44:42.176 A:middle
The first three collected data
using sensors open the device.

00:44:42.826 --> 00:44:45.296 A:middle
So we have the gait and
balance task, where you're asked

00:44:45.296 --> 00:44:47.766 A:middle
to walk back and forth we
collected accelerometer

00:44:47.766 --> 00:44:48.496 A:middle
and gyroscope data.

00:44:48.496 --> 00:44:51.086 A:middle
And we have the fitness task
where you are asked to walk

00:44:51.086 --> 00:44:54.026 A:middle
for six minutes as we collect
heart rate and podometry data

00:44:54.026 --> 00:44:56.966 A:middle
and the voice task, where
we use the microphone

00:44:57.266 --> 00:44:59.306 A:middle
to collect information
about your voice.



00:45:00.316 --> 00:45:02.956 A:middle
In addition to these,
we have two more tasks

00:45:02.956 --> 00:45:04.816 A:middle
which are more cognitive
measurement tasks.

00:45:05.266 --> 00:45:09.016 A:middle
So these use sort of more
interactive touch behavior,

00:45:09.326 --> 00:45:11.776 A:middle
so we have spatial memory task
in which you have a sequence

00:45:11.856 --> 00:45:14.356 A:middle
and asked to repeat it
and the tapping speed task

00:45:14.356 --> 00:45:16.476 A:middle
where you are asked to
rapidly alternate tapping

00:45:16.476 --> 00:45:17.236 A:middle
between two buttons.

00:45:19.256 --> 00:45:21.186 A:middle
In addition since we
released ResearchKit,

00:45:21.186 --> 00:45:23.156 A:middle
there have been two
more active tests added,

00:45:23.516 --> 00:45:26.186 A:middle
we've got a hearing test,
and now a reaction time test

00:45:26.186 --> 00:45:27.556 A:middle
where you are shown
a stimulus and have

00:45:27.556 --> 00:45:29.086 A:middle
to shake the device in response.

00:45:30.736 --> 00:45:33.296 A:middle
To give you a flavor of how
these active tasks worked

00:45:33.296 --> 00:45:34.986 A:middle
in practice, I will
need to show you a demo.

00:45:35.356 --> 00:45:37.086 A:middle
So that's next.

00:45:48.836 --> 00:45:51.166 A:middle
So this is a really short
demo because all I need

00:45:51.166 --> 00:45:54.706 A:middle
to do is instantiate one of
these simple predefined tasks.

00:45:55.686 --> 00:45:58.446 A:middle
So I will create this active
task computed property

00:45:59.066 --> 00:46:01.636 A:middle
which returns a two finger
tapping interval task,



00:45:59.066 --> 00:46:01.636 A:middle
which returns a two finger
tapping interval task,

00:46:01.926 --> 00:46:03.606 A:middle
and I just have to
specify a few parameters.

00:46:03.696 --> 00:46:05.036 A:middle
This is basically
the same for each

00:46:05.036 --> 00:46:06.586 A:middle
of the different active
tasks that we provide.

00:46:07.826 --> 00:46:09.276 A:middle
So you specify an identifier

00:46:09.406 --> 00:46:10.656 A:middle
which should be unique
within your study.

00:46:11.706 --> 00:46:13.296 A:middle
You specify an intended
use description

00:46:13.396 --> 00:46:16.326 A:middle
which is a localized string
that will be substituted

00:46:16.326 --> 00:46:19.016 A:middle
in into the prelocalized
content that we provide for each

00:46:19.016 --> 00:46:21.426 A:middle
of these active tasks and
you specify the duration

00:46:21.426 --> 00:46:23.016 A:middle
which is how long you
want the user to tap for.

00:46:23.736 --> 00:46:25.496 A:middle
It could also specify
some additional options

00:46:25.496 --> 00:46:28.506 A:middle
which control whether we include
the actual instruction steps

00:46:29.156 --> 00:46:31.816 A:middle
at the beginning and end of
the task because you might want

00:46:31.816 --> 00:46:33.036 A:middle
to provide your own instructions

00:46:33.036 --> 00:46:36.896 A:middle
if the ones we provide
don't work for you.

00:46:37.086 --> 00:46:40.566 A:middle
So now we have got our
active task, and we'll want

00:46:40.566 --> 00:46:41.746 A:middle
to add it to our table view.

00:46:41.826 --> 00:46:43.706 A:middle
So I just have to make a couple
of changes to support that.

00:46:44.216 --> 00:46:46.766 A:middle
I will add it to
my list of tasks

00:46:47.276 --> 00:46:51.506 A:middle
and mention my computed
property as a represented task

00:46:52.046 --> 00:46:54.846 A:middle
and when I run this, I
should have a third task now,

00:46:55.146 --> 00:46:59.376 A:middle
which will be this two
finger tapping task.

00:46:59.506 --> 00:47:02.266 A:middle
So the intended use description
gets populated in here



00:46:59.506 --> 00:47:02.266 A:middle
So the intended use description
gets populated in here

00:47:02.266 --> 00:47:05.786 A:middle
and the rest of this content is
localized to all the languages

00:47:05.786 --> 00:47:07.536 A:middle
that iOS supports and
we will be maintaining

00:47:07.536 --> 00:47:10.946 A:middle
that for all the new
active tasks we add.

00:47:11.176 --> 00:47:13.756 A:middle
So here's our next instruction

00:47:13.756 --> 00:47:15.036 A:middle
which tells me what
to actually do.

00:47:15.036 --> 00:47:16.796 A:middle
So I will be tapping on each
of the buttons alternately.

00:47:16.796 --> 00:47:20.486 A:middle
And when I come into the task
thetimer doesn't actually start

00:47:20.486 --> 00:47:23.546 A:middle
until I start tapping,
so as I start tapping,

00:47:23.546 --> 00:47:26.516 A:middle
we start to see the timer
going faster and faster

00:47:27.116 --> 00:47:28.686 A:middle
and the task completes.

00:47:29.006 --> 00:47:31.486 A:middle
When the task is finished, I
will get some results back.

00:47:31.706 --> 00:47:32.976 A:middle
We'll take a look
at how that works.

00:47:33.856 --> 00:47:34.646 A:middle
So because this is one

00:47:34.646 --> 00:47:38.406 A:middle
of the more cognitive tasks
the data aren't written

00:47:38.406 --> 00:47:39.096 A:middle
out to files.

00:47:39.506 --> 00:47:41.756 A:middle
Instead they are returned
as object in memory

00:47:42.446 --> 00:47:44.506 A:middle
which I've serialized to
JSON so we can have a look.

00:47:44.506 --> 00:47:46.626 A:middle
And so here we have our
task result as usual

00:47:46.626 --> 00:47:47.616 A:middle
with our start date
and the end date

00:47:47.616 --> 00:47:48.506 A:middle
and various other properties.

00:47:49.286 --> 00:47:51.086 A:middle
We have a couple of step
results which corresponds

00:47:51.086 --> 00:47:52.256 A:middle
to the introductory
instructions,

00:47:52.696 --> 00:47:54.916 A:middle
and then we've got another
step result that corresponds

00:47:54.916 --> 00:47:57.736 A:middle
to the active step and it
contains a child result

00:47:57.926 --> 00:47:59.206 A:middle
which is the tapping
interval result

00:47:59.206 --> 00:48:02.246 A:middle
for the two finger
tapping interval task.



00:47:59.206 --> 00:48:02.246 A:middle
for the two finger
tapping interval task.

00:48:02.246 --> 00:48:05.086 A:middle
That in turn contains an array
of samples which contain --

00:48:05.306 --> 00:48:07.316 A:middle
which in turn contain time
stamps for each of the taps

00:48:07.316 --> 00:48:10.776 A:middle
that I have made and locations,
which are just coordinates

00:48:10.776 --> 00:48:12.926 A:middle
on the screen and a
button identifier showing

00:48:12.926 --> 00:48:13.776 A:middle
which button I tapped.

00:48:14.386 --> 00:48:16.666 A:middle
and taps outside the buttons
would be recorded here.

00:48:17.466 --> 00:48:20.266 A:middle
In addition, there's some other
properties in this result,

00:48:20.266 --> 00:48:22.476 A:middle
which detail where
things were on screen,

00:48:22.476 --> 00:48:25.546 A:middle
so I can actually tell what
those locations corresponded to.

00:48:27.006 --> 00:48:28.946 A:middle
For other types of
active tasks you will tend

00:48:28.946 --> 00:48:31.436 A:middle
to see file-based results and
those would be an ORKFile result

00:48:31.756 --> 00:48:34.936 A:middle
with a file URL that points to
a particular location on disk

00:48:35.436 --> 00:48:37.556 A:middle
that would be inside the output
directory that you specified

00:48:37.556 --> 00:48:38.816 A:middle
when you set up your
task controller.

00:48:39.386 --> 00:48:44.116 A:middle
So that's my demo for
active tasks in ResearchKit.

00:48:45.516 --> 00:48:51.126 A:middle
[Applause]

00:48:51.626 --> 00:48:53.966 A:middle
Now today we've covered
three modules in ResearchKit.

00:48:53.966 --> 00:48:57.096 A:middle
We'vecovered surveys, informed
consent and active tasks

00:48:57.516 --> 00:48:59.826 A:middle
but we really don't
think it will stop there.



00:49:00.556 --> 00:49:03.926 A:middle
We think that ResearchKit is
going to continue to expand both

00:49:03.926 --> 00:49:06.486 A:middle
as third parties continue to
contribute, so that's you,

00:49:07.096 --> 00:49:10.346 A:middle
and as we continue to add
additional features and keep it

00:49:10.346 --> 00:49:12.616 A:middle
up to date with the latest
versions of our software.

00:49:13.206 --> 00:49:16.966 A:middle
So it will only get
better if you contribute.

00:49:17.086 --> 00:49:25.056 A:middle
So let's talk about
how you can do that.

00:49:25.206 --> 00:49:28.066 A:middle
Now ResearchKit is just an
open source project on GitHub.

00:49:28.636 --> 00:49:30.736 A:middle
So that means you will
interact with it in the same way

00:49:30.736 --> 00:49:33.176 A:middle
that you would interact with any
other such open source project.

00:49:34.016 --> 00:49:37.136 A:middle
First, you'll need to pick an
existing issue or open a new one

00:49:37.456 --> 00:49:40.126 A:middle
and ideally comment on it, so we
know that you're working on it.

00:49:40.696 --> 00:49:43.246 A:middle
Then, when you've got something
that you want to share with us,

00:49:43.246 --> 00:49:44.606 A:middle
you will submit a pull request.

00:49:44.836 --> 00:49:46.756 A:middle
And at that point,
reviewers both from Apple

00:49:47.226 --> 00:49:51.196 A:middle
and our other active external
contributors will review your

00:49:51.196 --> 00:49:54.006 A:middle
contribution both for the
quality of the submission

00:49:54.006 --> 00:49:56.146 A:middle
and also for how it matches
up with the ResearchKit

00:49:56.276 --> 00:49:57.506 A:middle
and how it fits in
with the project.

00:49:59.236 --> 00:50:01.376 A:middle
Now, so far, about 90%



00:49:59.236 --> 00:50:01.376 A:middle
Now, so far, about 90%

00:50:01.376 --> 00:50:04.246 A:middle
of the changes we received
have eventually got merged

00:50:04.356 --> 00:50:05.486 A:middle
into the code base.

00:50:05.946 --> 00:50:07.356 A:middle
I think that's a really
good starting point

00:50:08.106 --> 00:50:10.146 A:middle
for how we want things
to be going forward.

00:50:11.616 --> 00:50:13.736 A:middle
Once your change is merged,

00:50:13.736 --> 00:50:15.086 A:middle
though that's not
the end of the story.

00:50:15.766 --> 00:50:16.846 A:middle
At some point after that,

00:50:18.306 --> 00:50:20.266 A:middle
we will start the
convergence process

00:50:20.426 --> 00:50:22.366 A:middle
to bring ResearchKit
towards a new release.

00:50:22.366 --> 00:50:25.816 A:middle
And in fact we actually
concluded our first release done

00:50:25.816 --> 00:50:27.636 A:middle
using this process
yesterday with ResearchKit 1.

00:50:27.636 --> 00:50:31.996 A:middle
1. During that process, we
will review your change again,

00:50:32.216 --> 00:50:34.196 A:middle
both for things like
accessibility and also

00:50:34.196 --> 00:50:36.646 A:middle
to localize it to all the
languages that iOS supports

00:50:37.236 --> 00:50:39.476 A:middle
and we may ask you
to help out again.

00:50:40.316 --> 00:50:44.106 A:middle
Hopefully this doesn't
sound like too much work

00:50:44.286 --> 00:50:45.376 A:middle
and you would like
to help us out.

00:50:45.526 --> 00:50:48.666 A:middle
Let's look at some of the areas
where you could contribute.

00:50:49.166 --> 00:50:54.236 A:middle
One area where we've already
mentioned contributions is

00:50:54.236 --> 00:50:56.896 A:middle
active tasks and we've already
had those two new active tasks

00:50:56.896 --> 00:50:58.676 A:middle
contributed in the
last month and a half

00:50:58.896 --> 00:51:00.186 A:middle
with this project public.



00:50:58.896 --> 00:51:00.186 A:middle
with this project public.

00:51:01.976 --> 00:51:04.356 A:middle
But other areas where we've seen
contributions have been answer

00:51:04.356 --> 00:51:08.066 A:middle
formats, where someone's added
a vertical slider answer format,

00:51:09.006 --> 00:51:13.336 A:middle
and new steps where someone
added an image capture step.

00:51:15.796 --> 00:51:19.016 A:middle
In addition, going forward we
expect to see more contributions

00:51:19.016 --> 00:51:20.366 A:middle
in areas like device support.

00:51:21.056 --> 00:51:24.136 A:middle
So if you have a hardware device
that you think would make sense

00:51:24.136 --> 00:51:26.486 A:middle
to be used by people in
medical research studies,

00:51:26.736 --> 00:51:28.876 A:middle
then you can add some support
for it into ResearchKit

00:51:28.876 --> 00:51:31.116 A:middle
to help more researchers
use it in their apps.

00:51:32.176 --> 00:51:34.926 A:middle
Also, we expect to add
some back integrations.

00:51:35.216 --> 00:51:37.056 A:middle
So if you have a
back end service

00:51:37.206 --> 00:51:38.996 A:middle
and you think it would
integrate well with ResearchKit

00:51:38.996 --> 00:51:40.446 A:middle
and be a great data
solution storage

00:51:40.446 --> 00:51:42.726 A:middle
for researchers then it would
make some sense to add some code

00:51:42.726 --> 00:51:44.556 A:middle
to ResearchKit to support
your particular back end.

00:51:45.366 --> 00:51:46.946 A:middle
We know there are several
contributors out there

00:51:46.946 --> 00:51:48.766 A:middle
who are already interested
in doing this.

00:51:50.396 --> 00:51:52.596 A:middle
So I don't have time to
talk about all of these

00:51:52.676 --> 00:51:54.676 A:middle
in much detail but
what I do want to look

00:51:54.676 --> 00:52:01.696 A:middle
at a little more
is active tasks.



00:51:54.676 --> 00:52:01.696 A:middle
at a little more
is active tasks.

00:52:01.766 --> 00:52:04.656 A:middle
So you have already seen this
structure for active tasks

00:52:04.656 --> 00:52:06.766 A:middle
where we have some instruction
steps, a countdown step,

00:52:07.626 --> 00:52:09.296 A:middle
an active step and
a completion step.

00:52:10.516 --> 00:52:14.166 A:middle
And this active step, base
class actually has some other

00:52:14.166 --> 00:52:16.776 A:middle
behaviors that will be
useful for you when you go

00:52:16.776 --> 00:52:19.716 A:middle
to implement your
own active step.

00:52:19.856 --> 00:52:22.986 A:middle
So, active steps support
recorder configurations,

00:52:23.276 --> 00:52:24.706 A:middle
where you can configure
the active step

00:52:25.036 --> 00:52:28.266 A:middle
to automatically collect
data from various sensors

00:52:28.266 --> 00:52:30.176 A:middle
on the device during the
duration of that step

00:52:30.176 --> 00:52:31.256 A:middle
without writing very much code.

00:52:32.006 --> 00:52:37.596 A:middle
So take a closer look at how
those work -- at how those work.

00:52:37.786 --> 00:52:39.556 A:middle
Right now, we have
five recorders built

00:52:39.556 --> 00:52:40.276 A:middle
into ResearchKit.

00:52:40.846 --> 00:52:44.246 A:middle
We have an accelerometer
and device motion recorder

00:52:44.246 --> 00:52:46.946 A:middle
and a pedometer recorder that
collect data from CoreMotion

00:52:47.106 --> 00:52:49.386 A:middle
and we have a health
quality type recorder

00:52:49.386 --> 00:52:50.536 A:middle
for pulling data from HealthKit.

00:52:50.776 --> 00:52:53.146 A:middle
So for instance, that could
be used to collect heart rate.

00:52:54.496 --> 00:52:56.206 A:middle
Finally we have a
location recorder

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:57.576 A:middle
that can pull some information

00:52:57.576 --> 00:53:02.706 A:middle
from CoreLocation during the
duration of your active step.



00:52:57.576 --> 00:53:02.706 A:middle
from CoreLocation during the
duration of your active step.

00:53:02.856 --> 00:53:05.996 A:middle
Now, when you use these on
iOS, you would normally need

00:53:05.996 --> 00:53:08.106 A:middle
to obtain user permission
to get access to that data

00:53:08.576 --> 00:53:10.266 A:middle
and ResearchKit isn't
a system framework

00:53:10.266 --> 00:53:12.076 A:middle
and doesn't let you bypass
any of those controls.

00:53:12.476 --> 00:53:15.146 A:middle
But we do try to smooth out
the process so if you use these

00:53:15.146 --> 00:53:17.746 A:middle
in one or more of your steps
then the task view controller

00:53:17.746 --> 00:53:19.316 A:middle
will notice that and try to ask

00:53:19.316 --> 00:53:22.006 A:middle
for those permissions upfront
just after the instructions

00:53:22.136 --> 00:53:24.506 A:middle
but before beginning the
actual steps themselves.

00:53:25.106 --> 00:53:29.466 A:middle
So to give you a bit of flavor
of how recorders are used,

00:53:29.736 --> 00:53:31.326 A:middle
I thought I'd use the
fitness step example

00:53:31.536 --> 00:53:33.486 A:middle
from the six-minute walk
task in ResearchKit.

00:53:34.506 --> 00:53:35.546 A:middle
So here's our fitness step,

00:53:35.776 --> 00:53:37.576 A:middle
which is a subclass
of ORKActiveStep.

00:53:38.436 --> 00:53:41.696 A:middle
And when you subclass
ORKActiveStep you also subclass

00:53:41.696 --> 00:53:42.776 A:middle
the active step view controller.

00:53:43.366 --> 00:53:44.966 A:middle
You have an active
step view controller

00:53:45.286 --> 00:53:49.086 A:middle
which has a pointer
back to the step.

00:53:49.286 --> 00:53:51.686 A:middle
Now this fitness step is
configured with a couple

00:53:51.686 --> 00:53:52.726 A:middle
of recorder configurations.

00:53:53.176 --> 00:53:55.636 A:middle
It will have a health
quantity recorder configuration

00:53:56.256 --> 00:53:58.266 A:middle
with a particular identifier
which needs to be unique

00:53:58.266 --> 00:54:00.506 A:middle
within this step because
this is going to correspond



00:53:58.266 --> 00:54:00.506 A:middle
within this step because
this is going to correspond

00:54:00.506 --> 00:54:02.616 A:middle
to the result as you
will see in a minute.

00:54:03.026 --> 00:54:05.476 A:middle
This recorder configuration
has a couple of parameters.

00:54:05.816 --> 00:54:07.056 A:middle
So it's got a quantity type

00:54:07.296 --> 00:54:10.446 A:middle
which in this case is the heart
rate quantity type and the unit,

00:54:10.446 --> 00:54:12.746 A:middle
which in this case
is beats per minute

00:54:12.806 --> 00:54:13.956 A:middle
from your heart rate monitor.

00:54:14.506 --> 00:54:17.216 A:middle
You can have more than
one recorder configuration

00:54:17.326 --> 00:54:19.466 A:middle
so in this case we will
have the pedommeter recorder

00:54:19.466 --> 00:54:21.806 A:middle
configuration, again with
a different identifier,

00:54:21.806 --> 00:54:24.386 A:middle
so that you can identify the
results from this recorder.

00:54:25.876 --> 00:54:26.966 A:middle
When you run the fitness step,

00:54:27.496 --> 00:54:30.846 A:middle
you will get two
recorders instantiated

00:54:30.846 --> 00:54:33.306 A:middle
when the step begins this will
be a health quantity recorder

00:54:33.666 --> 00:54:35.546 A:middle
and a pedometer recorder
and each

00:54:35.546 --> 00:54:37.926 A:middle
of these will configure
themselves based

00:54:37.926 --> 00:54:40.676 A:middle
on the configuration
model object attached

00:54:40.676 --> 00:54:41.486 A:middle
to the fitness step.

00:54:42.006 --> 00:54:45.556 A:middle
When the task completes, you
will get back a step result,

00:54:45.556 --> 00:54:47.186 A:middle
as part of your task result

00:54:47.186 --> 00:54:50.446 A:middle
and that step result will
contain two child file results

00:54:50.676 --> 00:54:54.486 A:middle
one for each of those recorders,
with identifiers that correspond

00:54:54.646 --> 00:54:56.266 A:middle
to the corresponding
recorder configurations.

00:54:56.886 --> 00:55:00.666 A:middle
The file URL as I mentioned
already will point to a file



00:54:56.886 --> 00:55:00.666 A:middle
The file URL as I mentioned
already will point to a file

00:55:00.666 --> 00:55:02.726 A:middle
in the output directory
where that data got recorded.

00:55:03.626 --> 00:55:05.226 A:middle
The actual serialization format

00:55:05.646 --> 00:55:07.346 A:middle
in ResearchKit right
now is JSON,

00:55:07.416 --> 00:55:09.186 A:middle
but if you needed a different
format then it would be

00:55:09.186 --> 00:55:11.006 A:middle
straightforward to add
a different formatter.

00:55:11.496 --> 00:55:14.156 A:middle
So that's recorders.

00:55:14.256 --> 00:55:16.226 A:middle
Now, I have alluded
already to some

00:55:16.226 --> 00:55:17.306 A:middle
of the process you
will need to go

00:55:17.306 --> 00:55:19.016 A:middle
through to make a
custom active step

00:55:19.636 --> 00:55:22.506 A:middle
but let's delineate those
points now before we finish.

00:55:23.716 --> 00:55:25.406 A:middle
So when you go to create
your custom active step,

00:55:26.186 --> 00:55:28.126 A:middle
you will first subclass
ORKActiveStep

00:55:28.486 --> 00:55:30.126 A:middle
and subclass the active
step view controller.

00:55:30.506 --> 00:55:32.736 A:middle
Usually we have pairs
of these classes.

00:55:33.266 --> 00:55:34.996 A:middle
Then you will need
to build the UI.

00:55:35.946 --> 00:55:37.966 A:middle
And that could mean that you
completely override the UI

00:55:37.966 --> 00:55:39.636 A:middle
of your active step view
controller if you need

00:55:39.636 --> 00:55:42.016 A:middle
to control the whole
screen or it could mean

00:55:42.016 --> 00:55:43.346 A:middle
that you just set
the custom view,

00:55:43.516 --> 00:55:45.906 A:middle
which fits into the
built-in active step template

00:55:45.906 --> 00:55:46.456 A:middle
in ResearchKit.

00:55:46.956 --> 00:55:49.766 A:middle
You will need to configure
some recorders if you need

00:55:49.766 --> 00:55:52.496 A:middle
to actually collect sensor data
using the recorders we already

00:55:52.496 --> 00:55:56.206 A:middle
have and you may need to
add some new result classes.

00:55:56.856 --> 00:55:58.786 A:middle
So for the cognitive
game, for example,

00:55:58.786 --> 00:56:02.156 A:middle
you saw we had the tapping
interval task result there.



00:55:58.786 --> 00:56:02.156 A:middle
you saw we had the tapping
interval task result there.

00:56:02.706 --> 00:56:05.216 A:middle
That was an example
of a result class

00:56:05.216 --> 00:56:07.186 A:middle
that was created
specifically for that step.

00:56:07.186 --> 00:56:09.736 A:middle
And when you create an active
step that's like that one,

00:56:09.786 --> 00:56:12.316 A:middle
you will need to correspondingly
create your own class structure

00:56:12.606 --> 00:56:17.666 A:middle
which needs to be serializable
and that will introduce a couple

00:56:17.666 --> 00:56:19.756 A:middle
of limitations on what you
will include in those results.

00:56:22.656 --> 00:56:24.256 A:middle
That's it for active steps.

00:56:24.586 --> 00:56:27.686 A:middle
We talked about our three
modules and we talked about how

00:56:27.686 --> 00:56:28.666 A:middle
to contribute to ResearchKit.

00:56:29.176 --> 00:56:31.816 A:middle
And I just want to leave
you with a few thoughts.

00:56:32.146 --> 00:56:36.246 A:middle
First, ResearchKit is open
source and as a result,

00:56:36.246 --> 00:56:37.746 A:middle
if there's one thing
I want you to do

00:56:37.746 --> 00:56:40.856 A:middle
after this result is go away
and clone it and have a look

00:56:40.856 --> 00:56:42.456 A:middle
and see how it will
fit into your apps.

00:56:43.716 --> 00:56:45.646 A:middle
And since it's open
source, you can contribute.

00:56:45.896 --> 00:56:47.936 A:middle
You can make a difference to
the future of medical research.

00:56:48.616 --> 00:56:49.716 A:middle
And that's really
the main point.

00:56:49.876 --> 00:56:52.946 A:middle
This is an open project and it
will become what you make it.

00:56:53.836 --> 00:56:55.136 A:middle
There are a few other areas

00:56:55.136 --> 00:56:56.376 A:middle
where you can get some
additional information

00:56:56.376 --> 00:56:56.986 A:middle
about ResearchKit.

00:56:57.496 --> 00:57:00.696 A:middle
We have the ResearchKit.



00:56:57.496 --> 00:57:00.696 A:middle
We have the ResearchKit.

00:57:00.906 --> 00:57:03.266 A:middle
org which is our
primary landing page.

00:57:03.836 --> 00:57:05.906 A:middle
And that will have links to all
the different projects included

00:57:05.906 --> 00:57:08.266 A:middle
in ResearchKit, both the
apps using ResearchKit

00:57:08.656 --> 00:57:10.676 A:middle
and the framework
itself we've linked here.

00:57:11.056 --> 00:57:13.576 A:middle
For general inquiries,
for instance,

00:57:13.576 --> 00:57:16.686 A:middle
if you are a principal
investigator and you want to get

00:57:16.686 --> 00:57:18.856 A:middle
in touch with others who
might be able to help you

00:57:18.856 --> 00:57:22.056 A:middle
with your project, then you can
reach us at ResearchKit@apple.

00:57:22.056 --> 00:57:24.886 A:middle
com. And finally, for
technical support,

00:57:24.886 --> 00:57:25.786 A:middle
we've two mailing lists.

00:57:25.786 --> 00:57:29.726 A:middle
We'vegot ResearchKit Users
if you need to reach others

00:57:29.726 --> 00:57:31.456 A:middle
who are using the framework
or ask questions about how

00:57:31.456 --> 00:57:33.676 A:middle
to use it, and ResearchKit
Dev if you have questions

00:57:33.676 --> 00:57:34.416 A:middle
about how to contribute.

00:57:36.436 --> 00:57:38.576 A:middle
There are some related sessions
that may help you as you try

00:57:38.576 --> 00:57:39.626 A:middle
to put together a research app.

00:57:40.126 --> 00:57:41.746 A:middle
So there's What's New
in HealthKit yesterday.

00:57:42.026 --> 00:57:45.426 A:middle
We introduced some new data
types among other things.

00:57:45.426 --> 00:57:48.216 A:middle
So you can go and
visit that online

00:57:48.846 --> 00:57:51.176 A:middle
and also we had a HealthKit and
ResearchKit lab this morning

00:57:51.176 --> 00:57:53.096 A:middle
and there's another one
tomorrow morning at 11:00.

00:57:53.926 --> 00:57:55.306 A:middle
Finally there's a
health, fitness,

00:57:55.306 --> 00:57:57.916 A:middle
and research get together
in just a half hour

00:57:57.916 --> 00:57:59.926 A:middle
and I hope you'll
join us for that.

00:57:59.926 --> 00:58:02.416 A:middle
With that, thank you very
much and thanks for listening.



00:57:59.926 --> 00:58:02.416 A:middle
With that, thank you very
much and thanks for listening.

00:58:03.516 --> 00:58:06.500 A:middle
[Applause]
