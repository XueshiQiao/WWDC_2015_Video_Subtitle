[Applause]

00:00:33.606 --> 00:00:34.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:35.406 --> 00:00:36.966 A:middle
Welcome to Continuous
Integration

00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.466 A:middle
and Code Coverage in Xcode.

00:00:38.926 --> 00:00:40.036 A:middle
My name is Matt Moriarity.

00:00:40.186 --> 00:00:41.846 A:middle
I am an engineer
on the Xcode team.

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:44.306 A:middle
I am really excited to
be here today to talk

00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:47.046 A:middle
about some tools we have in
Xcode to help you get more

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:48.996 A:middle
out of testing and
hopefully motivate you

00:00:48.996 --> 00:00:50.496 A:middle
to write more tests.

00:00:52.816 --> 00:00:54.946 A:middle
Today we are going
to start by talking

00:00:54.946 --> 00:00:56.246 A:middle
about what Xcode Server is.

00:00:56.596 --> 00:00:58.846 A:middle
Xcode Server is a
continuous integration product

00:00:58.946 --> 00:01:00.086 A:middle
that we bundle with Xcode.



00:00:58.946 --> 00:01:00.086 A:middle
that we bundle with Xcode.

00:01:01.276 --> 00:01:04.756 A:middle
Then we will step into what's
new in Xcode Server and Xcode 7,

00:01:05.156 --> 00:01:07.896 A:middle
with a special focus on the
new code coverage feature

00:01:07.976 --> 00:01:09.026 A:middle
that we introduced this year.

00:01:10.056 --> 00:01:12.896 A:middle
Then we will spend the second
half of the session talking

00:01:12.896 --> 00:01:14.976 A:middle
about some more advanced
features of Xcode Server

00:01:15.226 --> 00:01:17.076 A:middle
that will allow you to
integrate it into some

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:18.446 A:middle
of your team's unique workflows.

00:01:19.626 --> 00:01:20.736 A:middle
And of course, all throughout,

00:01:20.776 --> 00:01:22.786 A:middle
we will have demos showing
you how all this great stuff

00:01:22.786 --> 00:01:23.126 A:middle
is done.

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.946 A:middle
So let's jump right in.

00:01:26.716 --> 00:01:30.506 A:middle
So Xcode Server is a feature
we introduced in Xcode

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:34.286 A:middle
with Xcode 5, and it's all
about supporting a process known

00:01:34.286 --> 00:01:35.596 A:middle
as continuous integration.

00:01:36.816 --> 00:01:38.146 A:middle
And continuous integration
is all

00:01:38.146 --> 00:01:41.076 A:middle
about improving collaboration
with your team to allow you

00:01:41.076 --> 00:01:42.156 A:middle
to build better software.

00:01:43.306 --> 00:01:43.956 A:middle
So what does that mean?

00:01:43.956 --> 00:01:47.716 A:middle
It means pulling down all
of your code regularly

00:01:47.996 --> 00:01:50.646 A:middle
and then building and testing
it and surfacing issues

00:01:50.646 --> 00:01:53.666 A:middle
like build errors or test
failures as soon as possible

00:01:53.936 --> 00:01:55.506 A:middle
so you can fix things
right away.

00:01:56.166 --> 00:02:00.336 A:middle
Now, there's a lot of ways you
can do continuous integration



00:01:56.166 --> 00:02:00.336 A:middle
Now, there's a lot of ways you
can do continuous integration

00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:02.786 A:middle
out there, but we think Xcode
Server is especially great

00:02:02.786 --> 00:02:04.846 A:middle
for app developers like
you for two reasons.

00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:08.295 A:middle
First of all, it's
really easy to set up.

00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:10.506 A:middle
Thanks to integration
with OS X Server,

00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:12.936 A:middle
if you've got OS X Server
and Xcode on your Mac,

00:02:13.186 --> 00:02:15.786 A:middle
you are minutes away from having
a continuous integration server

00:02:15.996 --> 00:02:17.356 A:middle
testing your project regularly.

00:02:17.906 --> 00:02:22.336 A:middle
And second, Xcode Server
has deep integration

00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:23.336 A:middle
with Xcode itself.

00:02:23.546 --> 00:02:25.806 A:middle
We know a lot about how
Xcode projects are built,

00:02:26.196 --> 00:02:28.776 A:middle
how we work with devices
and things like that,

00:02:28.776 --> 00:02:31.236 A:middle
so we can ask you as few
questions as possible to get up

00:02:31.236 --> 00:02:34.056 A:middle
and running with your code
checking out regularly.

00:02:34.656 --> 00:02:38.756 A:middle
So before we go any
further, I want to talk

00:02:38.756 --> 00:02:40.506 A:middle
about a few concepts
that we talk

00:02:40.506 --> 00:02:42.136 A:middle
about when we are talking
about Xcode Server.

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:45.126 A:middle
The first is something you are
probably familiar with even

00:02:45.126 --> 00:02:46.766 A:middle
if you have never used
Xcode Server before,

00:02:47.176 --> 00:02:48.356 A:middle
and that is a scheme.

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:52.546 A:middle
Every time you run your
project or run tests in Xcode,

00:02:52.546 --> 00:02:53.376 A:middle
you are running a scheme.

00:02:53.776 --> 00:02:55.436 A:middle
A lot of times they are
auto created for you,

00:02:55.436 --> 00:02:57.106 A:middle
but you can create your
own custom schemes,

00:02:57.456 --> 00:02:59.926 A:middle
and they basically form a recipe
for building your project,

00:02:59.926 --> 00:03:03.566 A:middle
so they tell you what targets to
build, what test bundles to run,



00:02:59.926 --> 00:03:03.566 A:middle
so they tell you what targets to
build, what test bundles to run,

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:06.166 A:middle
arguments to pass to your
executables, things like that.

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:09.076 A:middle
Schemes are important
for Xcode Server

00:03:09.326 --> 00:03:11.106 A:middle
when it comes time
to set up a bot.

00:03:12.636 --> 00:03:14.976 A:middle
Now, a bot is -- we
like to think about it

00:03:14.976 --> 00:03:18.196 A:middle
as having another
member of your team,

00:03:18.396 --> 00:03:21.376 A:middle
that it's basically taking a
particular scheme and building

00:03:21.376 --> 00:03:22.946 A:middle
and running it on the
schedule you define

00:03:23.206 --> 00:03:25.196 A:middle
and doing exactly the
actions you tell it to

00:03:25.646 --> 00:03:27.266 A:middle
and then reporting those
results back to you.

00:03:27.826 --> 00:03:32.496 A:middle
And each time that schedule goes
off and we run your project,

00:03:32.776 --> 00:03:33.906 A:middle
we call that an integration.

00:03:33.906 --> 00:03:36.416 A:middle
It's like the act of
integrating all the changes

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:37.886 A:middle
from every member of
your team together

00:03:38.166 --> 00:03:40.566 A:middle
and seeing how everything
comes together.

00:03:41.226 --> 00:03:44.946 A:middle
Now that we are all
on the same page,

00:03:45.156 --> 00:03:48.076 A:middle
let's talk about what's new
in Xcode 7 and Xcode Server.

00:03:49.586 --> 00:03:52.946 A:middle
To start, if you've used Xcode
Server before in Xcode 6,

00:03:53.226 --> 00:03:55.676 A:middle
you know when you go to edit one
of your bots, we would take you

00:03:55.676 --> 00:03:58.476 A:middle
through the entire workflow
for creating a bot again,

00:03:58.476 --> 00:04:00.326 A:middle
just with a lot of the
values already filled in.



00:03:58.476 --> 00:04:00.326 A:middle
just with a lot of the
values already filled in.

00:04:01.036 --> 00:04:03.906 A:middle
Now, that's a little
tedious when you want

00:04:03.906 --> 00:04:06.056 A:middle
to make a simple change
like adding a trigger,

00:04:06.056 --> 00:04:07.726 A:middle
changing your schedule,
something like that.

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:10.266 A:middle
Now we have this tabbed
interface that allows you

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:12.916 A:middle
to get right in, make the change
you want to do, and get out.

00:04:13.516 --> 00:04:18.526 A:middle
[Applause]

00:04:19.026 --> 00:04:20.536 A:middle
A lot of fans of tagged
workflows out there.

00:04:22.446 --> 00:04:25.006 A:middle
We've also made improvements
to source control in Xcode 7.

00:04:25.596 --> 00:04:28.486 A:middle
So whereas previously
we would kind of try

00:04:28.486 --> 00:04:30.266 A:middle
to automatically handle
all your source control

00:04:30.266 --> 00:04:32.696 A:middle
and hide the details from you,
we now surface more of that

00:04:32.696 --> 00:04:33.916 A:middle
to you so you can see exactly

00:04:33.916 --> 00:04:36.616 A:middle
which repositories your
bot is going to check out,

00:04:37.236 --> 00:04:39.836 A:middle
and you can select to not
include some of those.

00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:43.026 A:middle
And for the repositories you are
checking out, you can now see

00:04:43.026 --> 00:04:45.976 A:middle
and choose which branch you'll
check out instead of just -

00:04:46.516 --> 00:04:50.596 A:middle
[Applause]

00:04:51.096 --> 00:04:51.276 A:middle
Thank you.

00:04:51.276 --> 00:04:57.146 A:middle
Instead of just hoping that
Xcode figured it out correctly.

00:04:57.236 --> 00:04:59.656 A:middle
We also made improvements to
security in source control,

00:04:59.926 --> 00:05:02.876 A:middle
specifically when it comes
to SSH fingerprinting



00:04:59.926 --> 00:05:02.876 A:middle
specifically when it comes
to SSH fingerprinting

00:05:03.176 --> 00:05:04.846 A:middle
and self-signed certificates.

00:05:05.386 --> 00:05:08.856 A:middle
Both of these are not
automatically secure methods

00:05:08.856 --> 00:05:09.756 A:middle
of transportation.

00:05:09.756 --> 00:05:12.366 A:middle
They require you to trust the
server you are connecting to,

00:05:12.716 --> 00:05:16.106 A:middle
so that if the server
changes later, you will know

00:05:16.466 --> 00:05:17.496 A:middle
that they have a new fingerprint

00:05:17.496 --> 00:05:19.776 A:middle
and may be impersonating the
server you thought you were

00:05:19.776 --> 00:05:20.926 A:middle
connecting to.

00:05:21.306 --> 00:05:24.246 A:middle
Previously Xcode would
automatically trust the servers

00:05:24.586 --> 00:05:26.996 A:middle
and not do any verification.

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:29.886 A:middle
Now we require you to explicitly
trust any of these servers

00:05:30.166 --> 00:05:32.636 A:middle
and then we store the
fingerprint so if it changes

00:05:32.636 --> 00:05:35.496 A:middle
in the future, we won't check
out from the wrong server.

00:05:36.046 --> 00:05:40.426 A:middle
And we've also updated
many of the reports

00:05:40.426 --> 00:05:41.736 A:middle
that you see in your
integrations.

00:05:42.236 --> 00:05:44.516 A:middle
So the test report has been
cleaned up and compacted.

00:05:45.636 --> 00:05:47.876 A:middle
It's now easier to see
any assertion failures

00:05:47.876 --> 00:05:48.836 A:middle
that come up in your tests.

00:05:49.456 --> 00:05:54.566 A:middle
And the logs view
has gotten drastic

00:05:54.566 --> 00:05:55.676 A:middle
performance improvements.

00:05:55.926 --> 00:05:58.246 A:middle
Previously we would try to
show you a stacked view of all

00:05:58.246 --> 00:06:01.626 A:middle
of your logs, but that has
some significant performance



00:05:58.246 --> 00:06:01.626 A:middle
of your logs, but that has
some significant performance

00:06:01.676 --> 00:06:03.906 A:middle
penalties when you try to
expand one of those logs.

00:06:04.186 --> 00:06:06.236 A:middle
We now show you one log at
a time that you can choose

00:06:06.236 --> 00:06:07.756 A:middle
from a pop-up button
in the left corner,

00:06:08.156 --> 00:06:11.166 A:middle
and now viewing large
log files is super fast.

00:06:12.516 --> 00:06:19.496 A:middle
[Applause]

00:06:19.996 --> 00:06:23.216 A:middle
One of the other great things
that makes Xcode Server special

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:26.136 A:middle
when it comes to continuous
integration is it knows what

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:28.586 A:middle
kinds of issues Xcode
projects can produce

00:06:28.586 --> 00:06:31.466 A:middle
and knows what a build error
looks like, a test failure.

00:06:31.736 --> 00:06:35.216 A:middle
It's not just showing you
some raw plain text log file

00:06:35.446 --> 00:06:37.246 A:middle
and having you go
through and figure

00:06:37.246 --> 00:06:38.356 A:middle
out what actually happened.

00:06:39.396 --> 00:06:42.016 A:middle
So we do a lot of smart things
when it comes to these issues

00:06:42.016 --> 00:06:44.106 A:middle
in order to surface that
and make that issue useful.

00:06:45.626 --> 00:06:46.746 A:middle
When you run an integration --

00:06:46.896 --> 00:06:48.386 A:middle
this is true in Xcode
6 as well --

00:06:48.846 --> 00:06:51.326 A:middle
we show you this nice report
showing you all the issues

00:06:51.326 --> 00:06:52.906 A:middle
that came up in your build.

00:06:53.856 --> 00:06:56.256 A:middle
And we surface which ones are
new because we can compare them

00:06:56.256 --> 00:06:58.326 A:middle
to the previous integration,
and that allows us

00:06:58.326 --> 00:07:00.376 A:middle
to pinpoint exactly what
integration and thus



00:06:58.326 --> 00:07:00.376 A:middle
to pinpoint exactly what
integration and thus

00:07:00.376 --> 00:07:02.866 A:middle
which commits introduce
a particular issue,

00:07:03.276 --> 00:07:07.066 A:middle
and that makes it much
easier to find the cause,

00:07:07.346 --> 00:07:12.596 A:middle
track it down, and make a fix.

00:07:12.806 --> 00:07:15.176 A:middle
We have added some new stuff
in Xcode 7 around issues.

00:07:15.626 --> 00:07:17.066 A:middle
Now if you see an
issue that comes up

00:07:17.376 --> 00:07:20.266 A:middle
and you either know it was your
fault and you want to go fix it

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:22.506 A:middle
or you can see just from
looking at the issue,

00:07:22.506 --> 00:07:24.416 A:middle
like I know what's
wrong there, I can go in

00:07:24.416 --> 00:07:26.386 A:middle
and fix it real quick
and get this cleared up.

00:07:26.826 --> 00:07:29.436 A:middle
Then you can claim issues,
and that puts your name on it

00:07:29.476 --> 00:07:31.816 A:middle
so everyone on your team will
see that when they go look

00:07:31.816 --> 00:07:33.356 A:middle
at the report, and they will
know that they don't have

00:07:33.396 --> 00:07:36.866 A:middle
to worry about it;
you are on the case.

00:07:37.046 --> 00:07:38.946 A:middle
For issues that are
either intermittent

00:07:38.946 --> 00:07:41.936 A:middle
or know have been alre fixed,
you can silence those issues

00:07:41.936 --> 00:07:43.226 A:middle
for a certain period of time,

00:07:43.446 --> 00:07:44.936 A:middle
and they will disappear
from the report.

00:07:46.406 --> 00:07:48.826 A:middle
That allows you to focus
on exactly the things

00:07:48.826 --> 00:07:51.176 A:middle
that actually need your
attention without cluttering it

00:07:51.176 --> 00:07:52.876 A:middle
up with things you know
are already handled.

00:07:57.976 --> 00:07:58.996 A:middle
But one of the best things

00:07:58.996 --> 00:08:01.666 A:middle
about Xcode Server is
how well we interact



00:07:58.996 --> 00:08:01.666 A:middle
about Xcode Server is
how well we interact

00:08:01.666 --> 00:08:04.116 A:middle
with all the other features
that Xcode introduces.

00:08:04.336 --> 00:08:06.426 A:middle
And since there are some
great new features in Xcode 7,

00:08:06.776 --> 00:08:09.676 A:middle
we have taken the special time
to integrate those features

00:08:09.676 --> 00:08:10.856 A:middle
in Xcode Server as well.

00:08:11.306 --> 00:08:13.246 A:middle
I want to look at
a few of those.

00:08:14.516 --> 00:08:17.576 A:middle
So user interface
testing is new in Xcode 7.

00:08:19.016 --> 00:08:21.066 A:middle
And we've taken special
care to make sure

00:08:21.066 --> 00:08:22.696 A:middle
that works perfectly
in Xcode Server.

00:08:23.856 --> 00:08:26.486 A:middle
When you run Mac tests
or iOS simulator tests,

00:08:26.796 --> 00:08:28.346 A:middle
we create a full window session

00:08:28.346 --> 00:08:29.626 A:middle
in the background
on your server.

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:31.156 A:middle
That's where all
of your tests run.

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:33.525 A:middle
That means you don't have
to worry about is it going

00:08:33.525 --> 00:08:36.806 A:middle
to be the right environment for
Xcode 2, launch my application,

00:08:37.015 --> 00:08:38.135 A:middle
we'll make sure it works fine.

00:08:38.525 --> 00:08:40.236 A:middle
If you are using
real iOS devices,

00:08:40.466 --> 00:08:42.466 A:middle
then you will see
the UI test stepping

00:08:42.466 --> 00:08:45.786 A:middle
through the application
right on the device.

00:08:46.516 --> 00:08:50.546 A:middle
[Applause]

00:08:51.046 --> 00:08:52.576 A:middle
So user interface
testing is a great way

00:08:52.576 --> 00:08:54.866 A:middle
to test your application
at a high level,

00:08:54.866 --> 00:08:56.176 A:middle
the same way your
users will see it,

00:08:56.416 --> 00:08:58.456 A:middle
and test all the different
layers interacting together.

00:08:59.006 --> 00:09:01.406 A:middle
It's even better when you have
a server running those tests



00:08:59.006 --> 00:09:01.406 A:middle
It's even better when you have
a server running those tests

00:09:01.406 --> 00:09:05.696 A:middle
across multiple devices
at the same time.

00:09:05.796 --> 00:09:08.126 A:middle
And on a schedule.

00:09:09.756 --> 00:09:13.306 A:middle
On-demand resources is a new
feature in iOS 9 that allows you

00:09:13.306 --> 00:09:16.716 A:middle
to make your apps bundle
smaller by not storing

00:09:16.716 --> 00:09:18.156 A:middle
as many resources in the bundle.

00:09:18.376 --> 00:09:20.176 A:middle
Instead the App Store
will host them for you

00:09:20.666 --> 00:09:21.836 A:middle
when your app is on the Store.

00:09:23.056 --> 00:09:25.126 A:middle
Then your application can
download those resources

00:09:25.336 --> 00:09:26.886 A:middle
when they are needed
and they can be removed

00:09:26.886 --> 00:09:29.486 A:middle
from disk when you are done.

00:09:29.706 --> 00:09:31.946 A:middle
Now, that's great for when
your app is in the App Store,

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:35.336 A:middle
but when you are doing QA
internally before you release

00:09:35.706 --> 00:09:38.236 A:middle
and you need to test out the
builds of your application,

00:09:38.846 --> 00:09:40.386 A:middle
what happens to the
resources then?

00:09:40.386 --> 00:09:42.036 A:middle
The App Store is not going
to be hosting them then.

00:09:42.036 --> 00:09:45.666 A:middle
You are changing too fast for
that to really be practical.

00:09:46.916 --> 00:09:49.346 A:middle
But if you get your QA
builds from Xcode Server,

00:09:49.346 --> 00:09:52.056 A:middle
if you let your integrations
produce IPAS that you install

00:09:52.056 --> 00:09:55.506 A:middle
on your devices, then this is
handled completely automatically

00:09:55.506 --> 00:09:55.856 A:middle
for you.

00:09:56.196 --> 00:09:58.536 A:middle
You don't have to check a box,
you don't have to do anything.

00:09:58.746 --> 00:10:00.946 A:middle
Xcode Server will see you
have on-demand resources



00:09:58.746 --> 00:10:00.946 A:middle
Xcode Server will see you
have on-demand resources

00:10:00.946 --> 00:10:03.516 A:middle
in your application, it will
host them on its own server

00:10:03.846 --> 00:10:06.346 A:middle
and will teach your
application where to find them.

00:10:08.516 --> 00:10:12.666 A:middle
[Applause]

00:10:13.166 --> 00:10:15.576 A:middle
Finally, I want to dig
deeper into another one

00:10:15.576 --> 00:10:17.676 A:middle
of the new features in
Xcode 7 that goes great

00:10:17.676 --> 00:10:19.466 A:middle
with Xcode Server and
continuous integration,

00:10:19.666 --> 00:10:20.586 A:middle
and that's code coverage.

00:10:21.166 --> 00:10:25.536 A:middle
So code coverage is
a tool that's all

00:10:25.536 --> 00:10:28.056 A:middle
about measuring the value
of your tests, specifically,

00:10:28.256 --> 00:10:30.326 A:middle
we want to know what
code is actually running

00:10:30.636 --> 00:10:31.456 A:middle
when we run tests.

00:10:32.456 --> 00:10:35.986 A:middle
Because it's easy to go about
building up a big test suite

00:10:35.986 --> 00:10:39.106 A:middle
for your application and feel
like you are resilient to change

00:10:39.106 --> 00:10:40.646 A:middle
and that regressions
aren't going to come

00:10:40.646 --> 00:10:41.616 A:middle
up that you won't notice.

00:10:42.596 --> 00:10:45.506 A:middle
But how do you really know how
many tests is enough tests?

00:10:45.886 --> 00:10:48.706 A:middle
Say I've got an application
that's got 2,000 unit tests,

00:10:49.116 --> 00:10:52.536 A:middle
but only 20% of my application
is actually getting run

00:10:52.536 --> 00:10:53.086 A:middle
by those tests?

00:10:53.906 --> 00:10:56.686 A:middle
Well, that's still not as
useful as I might think it is.

00:10:57.016 --> 00:10:59.316 A:middle
So code coverage is all about
surfacing this information

00:10:59.316 --> 00:11:01.036 A:middle
to you so you can make
informed decisions.



00:10:59.316 --> 00:11:01.036 A:middle
to you so you can make
informed decisions.

00:11:01.906 --> 00:11:03.756 A:middle
So it allows you to run your
tests and measure exactly

00:11:03.826 --> 00:11:06.596 A:middle
which code is getting exercised
there and, more importantly,

00:11:07.026 --> 00:11:09.446 A:middle
which code is completely
untested and, thus,

00:11:09.506 --> 00:11:11.776 A:middle
that's code that could
have a regression

00:11:11.776 --> 00:11:13.756 A:middle
as you go adding new
features, and you wouldn't know

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:14.696 A:middle
about it from your tests.

00:11:15.266 --> 00:11:19.566 A:middle
So we think code coverage is
really important for teams

00:11:19.566 --> 00:11:20.856 A:middle
that are serious about testing,

00:11:21.146 --> 00:11:24.546 A:middle
and that's why we've integrated
code coverage into Xcode.

00:11:25.196 --> 00:11:27.146 A:middle
So like most great
Xcode features,

00:11:27.326 --> 00:11:29.696 A:middle
code coverage is built off of
tight integration with LLVM.

00:11:30.736 --> 00:11:33.776 A:middle
So when you have gathering code
coverage enabled in your scheme,

00:11:33.906 --> 00:11:35.636 A:middle
the compiler will
instrument your code

00:11:35.886 --> 00:11:38.586 A:middle
so we can count how often
each expression is executed,

00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:40.486 A:middle
then we will surface
this information

00:11:40.486 --> 00:11:41.366 A:middle
to you right in the IDE.

00:11:42.996 --> 00:11:44.206 A:middle
Now, there's two ways
we are going to do that.

00:11:45.406 --> 00:11:48.566 A:middle
The first is if you go to the
report navigator for your test,

00:11:48.756 --> 00:11:51.916 A:middle
you could do this in
Xcode 6, but now in 7,

00:11:51.916 --> 00:11:53.646 A:middle
there is a new tab will
labeled "coverage."

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:59.176 A:middle
If you look at that report, you
can see by target and then file

00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:02.136 A:middle
and then method exactly how
well covered the different parts



00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:02.136 A:middle
and then method exactly how
well covered the different parts

00:12:02.136 --> 00:12:02.986 A:middle
of your application are.

00:12:04.386 --> 00:12:07.366 A:middle
This is a great way to look at
your application at a high level

00:12:07.586 --> 00:12:10.136 A:middle
and then drill down and identify
which parts need your attention.

00:12:10.746 --> 00:12:16.346 A:middle
But if I get down to finding a
method that has 75% coverage,

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:18.076 A:middle
well, that's good to know,

00:12:18.076 --> 00:12:21.336 A:middle
but I don't really know what
I need to know to fix that.

00:12:21.336 --> 00:12:23.676 A:middle
I don't know which branches
of my code are tested

00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:24.426 A:middle
and which ones aren't.

00:12:25.446 --> 00:12:28.666 A:middle
So if I hit the arrow that
shows up when you hover over one

00:12:28.666 --> 00:12:30.726 A:middle
of these methods or
files, it will jump right

00:12:30.726 --> 00:12:31.736 A:middle
to the source code editor

00:12:31.736 --> 00:12:35.036 A:middle
where we show inline annotations
highlighting exactly which parts

00:12:35.036 --> 00:12:36.296 A:middle
of your application
are uncovered.

00:12:36.546 --> 00:12:38.906 A:middle
For the parts that are covered,
we'll tell you how many times

00:12:38.906 --> 00:12:39.876 A:middle
that executed in your test.

00:12:41.516 --> 00:12:47.486 A:middle
[Applause]

00:12:47.986 --> 00:12:51.006 A:middle
So code coverage is really great
on its own in the Xcode IDE,

00:12:51.066 --> 00:12:54.406 A:middle
but I think it gets even better
when you put it on Xcode Server

00:12:54.436 --> 00:12:56.796 A:middle
where you have a bot running
your project over time

00:12:56.886 --> 00:12:58.016 A:middle
across multiple devices.

00:12:58.666 --> 00:13:01.466 A:middle
So that's one of the
things that's special



00:12:58.666 --> 00:13:01.466 A:middle
So that's one of the
things that's special

00:13:01.466 --> 00:13:04.466 A:middle
about integrations and bots is
that you can set them up to run

00:13:04.466 --> 00:13:06.486 A:middle
on a suite of devices
instead of just one

00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:07.836 A:middle
at a time, like you do in Xcode.

00:13:08.956 --> 00:13:11.326 A:middle
So when you do that, we'll show
you the coverage data for all

00:13:11.326 --> 00:13:13.636 A:middle
of your devices together,
and we'll highlight

00:13:13.636 --> 00:13:16.706 A:middle
in orange any methods
or targets or files

00:13:16.956 --> 00:13:19.036 A:middle
that had different coverage
across your devices,

00:13:19.036 --> 00:13:22.536 A:middle
so you can identify where
things are different and decide

00:13:22.536 --> 00:13:25.166 A:middle
if that's a bug or maybe
that's expected behavior.

00:13:26.066 --> 00:13:27.836 A:middle
It could be fairly
common for you

00:13:27.836 --> 00:13:30.386 A:middle
to have code coverage that's
different on different devices,

00:13:30.386 --> 00:13:32.116 A:middle
especially in user
interface code,

00:13:32.326 --> 00:13:33.986 A:middle
where you might be doing
something different on, say,

00:13:33.986 --> 00:13:35.336 A:middle
an iPad versus an iPhone.

00:13:35.906 --> 00:13:40.366 A:middle
One of the things that
Xcode Server provides you

00:13:40.366 --> 00:13:42.396 A:middle
as well is a history
that's stored

00:13:42.396 --> 00:13:44.146 A:middle
and tracked along the
life of your project.

00:13:44.646 --> 00:13:47.036 A:middle
This allows us to, when you are
looking at the code coverage

00:13:47.036 --> 00:13:50.776 A:middle
for an integration, highlight
when changes happen and exactly

00:13:50.776 --> 00:13:53.966 A:middle
which methods and files had
those changes in coverage

00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:57.696 A:middle
so you can pinpoint that down
to a specific set of commits.

00:13:59.596 --> 00:14:03.266 A:middle
This history also allows us
to show trends, so in Xcode 6,



00:13:59.596 --> 00:14:03.266 A:middle
This history also allows us
to show trends, so in Xcode 6,

00:14:03.266 --> 00:14:05.846 A:middle
we had build history and test
history charts for your bot.

00:14:06.316 --> 00:14:08.116 A:middle
That shows as you're
adding more tests,

00:14:08.116 --> 00:14:09.176 A:middle
you can see the chart grow,

00:14:09.456 --> 00:14:11.816 A:middle
and you can see how well
your issues have been going

00:14:12.106 --> 00:14:13.516 A:middle
and how stable your
bot has been.

00:14:13.866 --> 00:14:15.836 A:middle
But now we also have a
new code coverage graph

00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:17.596 A:middle
that shows the overall coverage

00:14:17.596 --> 00:14:18.956 A:middle
of your project trending
over time.

00:14:20.376 --> 00:14:23.246 A:middle
Now this is great to know if,
for instance, if it's improving,

00:14:23.246 --> 00:14:24.816 A:middle
then you know as
you add features,

00:14:24.816 --> 00:14:27.086 A:middle
you are either adding
tests for those features

00:14:27.476 --> 00:14:29.016 A:middle
or you're adding
tests for features

00:14:29.016 --> 00:14:30.436 A:middle
that previously had no coverage.

00:14:31.056 --> 00:14:32.456 A:middle
Or maybe it's trending downward

00:14:32.456 --> 00:14:33.766 A:middle
because you are moving
a little too fast

00:14:33.766 --> 00:14:35.536 A:middle
and not testing the
features you are adding now.

00:14:35.766 --> 00:14:37.946 A:middle
This can help you make
informed decisions going forward

00:14:38.076 --> 00:14:39.536 A:middle
about what you want
to do and how you want

00:14:39.536 --> 00:14:40.486 A:middle
to spend your development time.

00:14:41.076 --> 00:14:46.886 A:middle
And of course, if you are using
big screen in your workspace

00:14:46.966 --> 00:14:50.166 A:middle
to show your overall bot status,
right below the number of tests

00:14:50.166 --> 00:14:52.426 A:middle
in your project we'll also
show you your overall coverage

00:14:52.426 --> 00:14:54.546 A:middle
percentage, so you can
keep an eye on that.

00:14:56.156 --> 00:14:57.376 A:middle
All right.

00:14:57.786 --> 00:14:59.486 A:middle
So now I'd like to bring
up my colleague, Eric,

00:14:59.786 --> 00:15:01.756 A:middle
to demonstrate some of
the code coverage features



00:14:59.786 --> 00:15:01.756 A:middle
to demonstrate some of
the code coverage features

00:15:01.756 --> 00:15:02.976 A:middle
in Xcode and Xcode Server.

00:15:03.516 --> 00:15:10.706 A:middle
[Applause]

00:15:11.206 --> 00:15:11.676 A:middle
&gt;&gt; ERIC DUDIAK: Thank you, Matt.

00:15:11.676 --> 00:15:14.656 A:middle
I am going to show you an
application that we've built

00:15:14.656 --> 00:15:17.726 A:middle
for internal use that we
use to track coffee owed

00:15:17.726 --> 00:15:18.826 A:middle
from one person to another.

00:15:18.826 --> 00:15:21.116 A:middle
You may have seen this
application last year,

00:15:21.116 --> 00:15:22.876 A:middle
we've made a few
enhancements to it since then.

00:15:24.046 --> 00:15:26.996 A:middle
Basically, the rule is you owe
someone coffee if they fix a bug

00:15:26.996 --> 00:15:29.166 A:middle
for you or otherwise
owe you a favor.

00:15:29.166 --> 00:15:31.606 A:middle
So we have a whole
application to track that.

00:15:32.186 --> 00:15:34.236 A:middle
And like any good application,
we have unit testing

00:15:34.236 --> 00:15:36.086 A:middle
to make sure as we are
adding features to it,

00:15:36.086 --> 00:15:39.766 A:middle
we are not impacting
existing working code.

00:15:39.966 --> 00:15:42.786 A:middle
So having you test those is
really only half the battle.

00:15:42.786 --> 00:15:45.666 A:middle
I don't know how many unit tests
I am comfortable with in terms

00:15:45.666 --> 00:15:49.256 A:middle
of when this application
is actually fully tested,

00:15:49.256 --> 00:15:51.786 A:middle
and I want to look at coverage
and see what we have here.

00:15:53.226 --> 00:15:55.076 A:middle
Because maybe we don't
have that many tests.

00:15:55.076 --> 00:15:56.666 A:middle
So let's take a look at it.

00:15:56.666 --> 00:15:58.866 A:middle
I actually ran the test
earlier before I got up here.

00:15:58.866 --> 00:16:01.086 A:middle
We can just take a
look on the device.



00:15:58.866 --> 00:16:01.086 A:middle
We can just take a
look on the device.

00:16:01.086 --> 00:16:02.396 A:middle
We only have about seven tests.

00:16:02.556 --> 00:16:05.786 A:middle
That's pretty bad.

00:16:06.626 --> 00:16:07.786 A:middle
But it's a small application.

00:16:07.786 --> 00:16:09.906 A:middle
Maybe that's enough
to cover everything.

00:16:09.906 --> 00:16:11.676 A:middle
They are all passing at
least, so that's a good start.

00:16:11.676 --> 00:16:12.816 A:middle
Let's look at coverage.

00:16:12.816 --> 00:16:16.656 A:middle
So if we look at the
coverage report here,

00:16:16.656 --> 00:16:19.186 A:middle
we see the application is
broken down into two targets.

00:16:19.226 --> 00:16:22.156 A:middle
We have a UI-level
application, coffeeboard.app,

00:16:22.706 --> 00:16:24.456 A:middle
which doesn't have
much coverage.

00:16:25.466 --> 00:16:25.876 A:middle
But that's okay.

00:16:25.876 --> 00:16:26.766 A:middle
It's a UI application.

00:16:26.766 --> 00:16:28.116 A:middle
I should write some
UI tests for that.

00:16:28.116 --> 00:16:30.806 A:middle
I am more concerned about this
foundation level framework.

00:16:31.016 --> 00:16:32.956 A:middle
Here we see only
about 50% coverage.

00:16:32.956 --> 00:16:36.386 A:middle
Now, that's pretty sad because
this could be 100% covered

00:16:36.386 --> 00:16:37.116 A:middle
if we tried hard.

00:16:37.676 --> 00:16:40.946 A:middle
And it looks like the class
that's really falling behind is

00:16:40.946 --> 00:16:42.366 A:middle
this transaction class.

00:16:43.186 --> 00:16:45.116 A:middle
And if we look at the
transaction class,

00:16:46.036 --> 00:16:47.346 A:middle
we see we have a bunch
of methods in here

00:16:47.346 --> 00:16:49.486 A:middle
that aren't getting called
at all in our unit tests.

00:16:49.686 --> 00:16:52.066 A:middle
We are creating a few
transactions, and we can see

00:16:52.066 --> 00:16:53.716 A:middle
that in the initializers
being called,

00:16:53.716 --> 00:16:56.336 A:middle
but we are never actually
doing anything with them.

00:16:56.446 --> 00:16:58.466 A:middle
So I should explain a
little bit about our app.

00:16:58.466 --> 00:16:59.716 A:middle
It has a really neat feature,



00:17:00.226 --> 00:17:02.626 A:middle
which is using a proprietary
algorithm that we have.

00:17:02.726 --> 00:17:05.646 A:middle
If I owe Matt two coffees
and he owes me one coffee,

00:17:05.906 --> 00:17:06.976 A:middle
we actually merge that down

00:17:06.976 --> 00:17:08.736 A:middle
to just a single
coffee that I owe Matt.

00:17:10.116 --> 00:17:11.376 A:middle
Really secret algorithm
that I want

00:17:11.376 --> 00:17:14.165 A:middle
to make sure is very well
tested, and also I am not

00:17:14.165 --> 00:17:16.986 A:middle
that good at math, so
I have to make sure.

00:17:17.925 --> 00:17:20.606 A:middle
So let's see and look at the
actual source file for this,

00:17:20.646 --> 00:17:22.766 A:middle
and just like Matt said, I
am going to use the arrow

00:17:22.766 --> 00:17:27.026 A:middle
that shows up on hover and jump
straight into my source editor.

00:17:28.146 --> 00:17:32.016 A:middle
Here we see a whole lot of these
dark, highlighted sections.

00:17:32.306 --> 00:17:35.236 A:middle
Anything that's using
the default background

00:17:35.236 --> 00:17:37.096 A:middle
of my source editor --
white in this case --

00:17:37.406 --> 00:17:39.616 A:middle
is code that's already
covered, and I don't really need

00:17:39.616 --> 00:17:40.526 A:middle
to worry about it too much.

00:17:40.666 --> 00:17:43.336 A:middle
I am really more concerned about
all of this code that's showing

00:17:43.336 --> 00:17:44.406 A:middle
up with a gray background.

00:17:44.806 --> 00:17:47.786 A:middle
I can confirm it's uncovered
because on the right side here,

00:17:48.146 --> 00:17:50.166 A:middle
we see a bunch of
zeros indicating

00:17:50.166 --> 00:17:51.246 A:middle
that this code was never passed

00:17:51.246 --> 00:17:53.746 A:middle
over inside any of
my unit tests.

00:17:54.686 --> 00:17:55.436 A:middle
So that's not good.

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:58.546 A:middle
Now let's navigate
over to the unit test

00:17:58.546 --> 00:17:59.466 A:middle
and take a look at this.



00:18:00.256 --> 00:18:02.006 A:middle
If I go to the transaction
tests,

00:18:02.086 --> 00:18:05.256 A:middle
I see that I just
don't have any tests.

00:18:05.256 --> 00:18:06.816 A:middle
That's kind of a problem.

00:18:07.126 --> 00:18:08.786 A:middle
So let's fix that right now.

00:18:08.786 --> 00:18:11.326 A:middle
I am going to go ahead and
create a little blank space here

00:18:11.326 --> 00:18:13.546 A:middle
and write in a little
bit of Swift.

00:18:14.446 --> 00:18:16.626 A:middle
And of course, I assume
you all have magic macros

00:18:16.626 --> 00:18:18.176 A:middle
that add all your
unit tests for you.

00:18:18.176 --> 00:18:19.566 A:middle
That's how we all
develop, right?

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:25.586 A:middle
[Applause]

00:18:26.086 --> 00:18:28.126 A:middle
I am going to go ahead and
run the test on the device.

00:18:28.126 --> 00:18:29.356 A:middle
It's going to take a second.

00:18:29.356 --> 00:18:32.036 A:middle
As Matt said, we are
using LLVM to go ahead

00:18:32.036 --> 00:18:34.616 A:middle
and instrument your code while
it's running so we know exactly

00:18:34.616 --> 00:18:36.156 A:middle
which expressions are being run.

00:18:36.796 --> 00:18:40.346 A:middle
When that runs on my device, I
am going to look at the scheme.

00:18:40.626 --> 00:18:43.316 A:middle
One thing to keep in mind,
since it is a feature of LLVM,

00:18:43.316 --> 00:18:44.726 A:middle
it's optional in Xcode.

00:18:44.956 --> 00:18:47.826 A:middle
The way I turned it on is
went into the scheme editor

00:18:48.066 --> 00:18:49.336 A:middle
and selected the test action.

00:18:49.756 --> 00:18:51.186 A:middle
I then made sure
that check box for

00:18:51.186 --> 00:18:52.846 A:middle
"gather data coverage"
is selected.

00:18:53.906 --> 00:18:55.486 A:middle
That ensures I get
coverage data.

00:18:56.256 --> 00:18:56.796 A:middle
Perfect timing.

00:18:56.796 --> 00:18:58.026 A:middle
All my tests succeeded.

00:18:58.246 --> 00:19:00.266 A:middle
Great, they always do when I
build them with magic macros.



00:18:58.246 --> 00:19:00.266 A:middle
Great, they always do when I
build them with magic macros.

00:19:01.556 --> 00:19:03.696 A:middle
If I look at the
test report now,

00:19:03.746 --> 00:19:05.776 A:middle
I see I have more unit tests.

00:19:05.966 --> 00:19:07.266 A:middle
But that's not really
the whole story.

00:19:07.266 --> 00:19:08.656 A:middle
Let's look at that
coverage report again.

00:19:09.186 --> 00:19:12.186 A:middle
Here we see a much
prettier picture.

00:19:12.186 --> 00:19:15.646 A:middle
If I zoom in on that, we will
see I am now at 76% covered,

00:19:15.896 --> 00:19:17.696 A:middle
not all the way there
but doing a lot better

00:19:17.696 --> 00:19:18.446 A:middle
than we were before.

00:19:19.016 --> 00:19:20.886 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead

00:19:20.886 --> 00:19:22.936 A:middle
and disclose the
transaction class again,

00:19:22.936 --> 00:19:24.016 A:middle
and here we see a lot more

00:19:24.016 --> 00:19:25.176 A:middle
of these methods
are getting covered.

00:19:25.176 --> 00:19:27.576 A:middle
I am testing that merge code
that I was worried about earlier

00:19:27.996 --> 00:19:29.416 A:middle
and was causing me to
lose a lot of sleep.

00:19:29.936 --> 00:19:33.006 A:middle
Now one interesting thing, if
we go back to the source editor,

00:19:34.166 --> 00:19:36.546 A:middle
if we look at the
is equal method,

00:19:36.546 --> 00:19:38.686 A:middle
if you noticed before it
was only partially covered.

00:19:38.686 --> 00:19:41.186 A:middle
We can see here exactly
why that is.

00:19:41.766 --> 00:19:42.706 A:middle
If we look at the is equal,

00:19:42.706 --> 00:19:45.026 A:middle
we don't actually compare our
transaction class to something

00:19:45.026 --> 00:19:46.426 A:middle
that isn't a transaction class,

00:19:46.876 --> 00:19:49.046 A:middle
so this return false
is never getting called

00:19:49.046 --> 00:19:50.266 A:middle
in any of our unit tests.

00:19:51.006 --> 00:19:53.266 A:middle
So being able to see
this coverage as you go

00:19:53.266 --> 00:19:55.556 A:middle
through different branches is
very useful if you have a lot

00:19:55.556 --> 00:19:58.326 A:middle
of branching logic in your code
that you know has edge cases.

00:19:58.766 --> 00:20:00.846 A:middle
This way you can ensure that
every edge case is covered



00:19:58.766 --> 00:20:00.846 A:middle
This way you can ensure that
every edge case is covered

00:20:00.846 --> 00:20:02.126 A:middle
when you are writing
your unit tests.

00:20:02.986 --> 00:20:05.286 A:middle
We can also see a lot of this
code is getting covered multiple

00:20:05.286 --> 00:20:07.256 A:middle
times, and that's really
important to make sure

00:20:07.256 --> 00:20:09.276 A:middle
if you know there are multiple
cases that hit the same path

00:20:09.276 --> 00:20:10.916 A:middle
in your code but
ultimately are different,

00:20:10.916 --> 00:20:14.446 A:middle
you are getting coverage
on all of them.

00:20:14.636 --> 00:20:16.876 A:middle
Now, everything I just
did was a bit tedious,

00:20:16.876 --> 00:20:19.576 A:middle
and I wish I could just have
someone run these unit tests all

00:20:19.576 --> 00:20:21.896 A:middle
day not have to worry about it,

00:20:21.896 --> 00:20:23.216 A:middle
not to compare them
one to the other.

00:20:23.216 --> 00:20:25.586 A:middle
I was told there wasn't
money in the budget

00:20:25.586 --> 00:20:26.926 A:middle
for an intern to do that.

00:20:27.586 --> 00:20:29.226 A:middle
Let's look at Xcode Server.

00:20:29.226 --> 00:20:32.016 A:middle
I already set up a bot for this
and it's on a different branch

00:20:32.016 --> 00:20:36.466 A:middle
that already has the commit,
so let's look at the bot.

00:20:36.466 --> 00:20:38.146 A:middle
Here just like Matt was
showing in the slides earlier,

00:20:38.146 --> 00:20:41.556 A:middle
we see a high-level overview of
my project as it's been running

00:20:41.556 --> 00:20:44.706 A:middle
for the past 24 hours
and over the past amount

00:20:44.706 --> 00:20:46.306 A:middle
of time I have been
running this bot.

00:20:46.736 --> 00:20:48.876 A:middle
At the top we surface
high-level statistics,

00:20:49.486 --> 00:20:52.246 A:middle
and you can show the statistics
for any period of time, week,

00:20:52.246 --> 00:20:56.066 A:middle
hour, month, year, or since
the beginning of your bot.

00:20:56.736 --> 00:20:58.076 A:middle
Then we see build history.

00:20:58.076 --> 00:21:00.116 A:middle
This is where we
surface errors, warnings,



00:20:58.076 --> 00:21:00.116 A:middle
This is where we
surface errors, warnings,

00:21:00.116 --> 00:21:01.366 A:middle
analysis issues over time.

00:21:01.526 --> 00:21:03.296 A:middle
In this case, I had a
few warnings earlier,

00:21:03.296 --> 00:21:04.466 A:middle
but I've gone ahead
and fixed those,

00:21:04.466 --> 00:21:06.196 A:middle
so we are currently
showing no issues.

00:21:06.826 --> 00:21:09.196 A:middle
The next two graphs are
probably most important

00:21:09.196 --> 00:21:10.236 A:middle
for continuous integrations,

00:21:10.236 --> 00:21:11.876 A:middle
assuming your project
is building cleanly

00:21:11.876 --> 00:21:13.076 A:middle
with no warnings or errors.

00:21:13.656 --> 00:21:14.696 A:middle
And that is your tests.

00:21:15.196 --> 00:21:17.436 A:middle
In this case we see I had
a few test failures earlier

00:21:17.436 --> 00:21:18.936 A:middle
but I've been steadily
adding tests.

00:21:19.596 --> 00:21:22.676 A:middle
That's great, but what we really
want to see is a steady increase

00:21:22.946 --> 00:21:26.136 A:middle
in tests all passing, but
also a steady increase

00:21:26.136 --> 00:21:27.696 A:middle
in code coverage
with those tests.

00:21:27.916 --> 00:21:29.886 A:middle
If you are adding tests
but not adding coverage,

00:21:29.886 --> 00:21:31.756 A:middle
you are not really
adding as much value

00:21:31.756 --> 00:21:32.486 A:middle
as you might think you are.

00:21:33.356 --> 00:21:36.056 A:middle
If I look at the coverage,
the last integration --

00:21:36.056 --> 00:21:38.346 A:middle
this is that commit I
just made you didn't see,

00:21:38.346 --> 00:21:39.186 A:middle
but I promise I made it --

00:21:39.186 --> 00:21:41.916 A:middle
we can actually go straight
into the coverage report.

00:21:43.296 --> 00:21:45.656 A:middle
So this looks a lot like
what we just saw in Xcode

00:21:45.656 --> 00:21:46.986 A:middle
when I ran my tests locally.

00:21:47.716 --> 00:21:50.076 A:middle
Just like in Xcode, we
break it down by target

00:21:50.076 --> 00:21:51.716 A:middle
and across different classes.

00:21:51.956 --> 00:21:53.516 A:middle
And I can expand that
transaction class

00:21:54.336 --> 00:21:56.236 A:middle
and see the exact same
methods getting the same level

00:21:56.236 --> 00:21:56.696 A:middle
of coverage.

00:21:56.946 --> 00:21:58.656 A:middle
But there are two
big differences.

00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:00.676 A:middle
So in this case,
I can see change



00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:00.676 A:middle
So in this case,
I can see change

00:22:00.676 --> 00:22:02.246 A:middle
over time right in the report.

00:22:02.246 --> 00:22:04.086 A:middle
So instead of having to go
through two different reports

00:22:04.086 --> 00:22:06.406 A:middle
to see whether I actually
increased the coverage,

00:22:06.406 --> 00:22:08.006 A:middle
especially if it's a
less drastic change

00:22:08.006 --> 00:22:10.876 A:middle
than the one I just made, we
can surface that right here.

00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:13.606 A:middle
So my coverage is now 22% better

00:22:13.676 --> 00:22:15.996 A:middle
in CB foundation.framework
than it was before.

00:22:16.856 --> 00:22:17.486 A:middle
And in particular,

00:22:17.486 --> 00:22:21.146 A:middle
that transaction class
increased 48% more covered.

00:22:21.746 --> 00:22:24.486 A:middle
Now we highlight down here in
orange an interesting thing,

00:22:24.486 --> 00:22:26.816 A:middle
which is difference
between devices.

00:22:27.286 --> 00:22:30.036 A:middle
And actually, in Xcode
Server's reports,

00:22:30.036 --> 00:22:33.296 A:middle
I can click this checkbox and
show the device differences

00:22:33.776 --> 00:22:34.866 A:middle
and highlight that immediately.

00:22:35.386 --> 00:22:36.236 A:middle
Now, in this case, it looks

00:22:36.236 --> 00:22:38.756 A:middle
like this detail view
controller isn't showing

00:22:38.756 --> 00:22:40.756 A:middle
up at all on my iPhone.

00:22:40.756 --> 00:22:42.106 A:middle
That's actually to be expected.

00:22:42.106 --> 00:22:44.266 A:middle
In this case, our application
uses the split view,

00:22:44.796 --> 00:22:46.426 A:middle
and that second view
controller doesn't show

00:22:46.426 --> 00:22:48.556 A:middle
up on the iPhone unless
someone actually were to tap it.

00:22:48.556 --> 00:22:50.606 A:middle
And our unit tests don't
exercise that code.

00:22:51.116 --> 00:22:53.546 A:middle
This isn't particularly unusual,
but it's important to make sure

00:22:53.546 --> 00:22:54.946 A:middle
that every time you see
something like this,

00:22:54.946 --> 00:22:56.436 A:middle
that you expect it to happen.

00:22:56.556 --> 00:22:58.526 A:middle
That's why we make it
very easy in Xcode Server

00:22:58.806 --> 00:23:00.936 A:middle
to see differences between
different classes of devices.



00:22:58.806 --> 00:23:00.936 A:middle
to see differences between
different classes of devices.

00:23:01.776 --> 00:23:04.336 A:middle
It makes it very easy
to determine when code

00:23:04.336 --> 00:23:05.596 A:middle
that should be covered isn't.

00:23:06.066 --> 00:23:09.966 A:middle
That's continuous integration
showing code coverage.

00:23:09.966 --> 00:23:11.436 A:middle
With that, I am going to
let Matt talk about some

00:23:11.436 --> 00:23:13.576 A:middle
of the more advanced
features of Xcode Server.

00:23:14.516 --> 00:23:20.406 A:middle
[Applause]

00:23:20.906 --> 00:23:21.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; MATT MORIARITY:
Thank you, Eric.

00:23:22.786 --> 00:23:24.916 A:middle
So like Eric said,
I want to talk

00:23:24.916 --> 00:23:26.776 A:middle
about some more advanced
features in Xcode Server.

00:23:27.466 --> 00:23:30.906 A:middle
I know that many of you
developers are very interested

00:23:31.196 --> 00:23:33.536 A:middle
in extending Xcode Server
and integrating it to parts

00:23:33.536 --> 00:23:34.726 A:middle
of your team's workflows.

00:23:35.166 --> 00:23:39.076 A:middle
We know Xcode Server is
not the only tools you use

00:23:39.076 --> 00:23:41.936 A:middle
to get things done, so we want
to provide ways for Xcode Server

00:23:41.936 --> 00:23:43.206 A:middle
to work with everything you use

00:23:43.586 --> 00:23:45.156 A:middle
and be a perfect
fit for your tetam.

00:23:45.746 --> 00:23:49.296 A:middle
So we have two ways I am going
to talk about today in terms

00:23:49.296 --> 00:23:52.126 A:middle
of integrating Xcode into
everything else you are using.

00:23:52.716 --> 00:23:54.186 A:middle
The first one is triggers.

00:23:55.706 --> 00:23:59.316 A:middle
So triggers were introduced
in Xcode 6, and they are all

00:23:59.316 --> 00:24:02.626 A:middle
about providing custom actions
that integrate in the lifecycle



00:23:59.316 --> 00:24:02.626 A:middle
about providing custom actions
that integrate in the lifecycle

00:24:02.776 --> 00:24:04.186 A:middle
of your bots and
your integrations.

00:24:05.026 --> 00:24:07.386 A:middle
So triggers can either
be email notifications

00:24:07.456 --> 00:24:09.616 A:middle
that provide details and
configurable information

00:24:09.616 --> 00:24:11.516 A:middle
about your integrations
and how they ran,

00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:15.126 A:middle
what issues they produced,
committers, things like that.

00:24:15.606 --> 00:24:18.976 A:middle
Or more interestingly, they can
be arbitrary scripts written

00:24:18.976 --> 00:24:20.466 A:middle
in the programming
language of your choice.

00:24:21.946 --> 00:24:24.196 A:middle
So by default, we will run
these scripts using Bash

00:24:24.196 --> 00:24:25.916 A:middle
so you can type any
old shell command

00:24:25.916 --> 00:24:27.926 A:middle
into your triggers
and that should work.

00:24:28.496 --> 00:24:30.756 A:middle
But if you include a hash
bang at the top of your script

00:24:30.756 --> 00:24:32.796 A:middle
like you would if you were
writing a command line tool,

00:24:32.906 --> 00:24:35.996 A:middle
then we will use that, and
you can use any interpreter

00:24:35.996 --> 00:24:36.426 A:middle
you like.

00:24:36.986 --> 00:24:39.076 A:middle
You can even write your triggers
in Swift if you so choose.

00:24:40.696 --> 00:24:41.826 A:middle
Eric will demonstrate
that later.

00:24:42.406 --> 00:24:49.426 A:middle
A trigger can run either before
or after your integration runs,

00:24:49.896 --> 00:24:52.106 A:middle
and each of those phases
provides a unique opportunity

00:24:52.106 --> 00:24:53.666 A:middle
to do something cool
with your bots.

00:24:54.356 --> 00:24:56.756 A:middle
Triggers that run
before integration run

00:24:56.976 --> 00:24:58.246 A:middle
after your source
code checks out.

00:24:58.736 --> 00:25:00.716 A:middle
That's important because it
means you have full access



00:24:58.736 --> 00:25:00.716 A:middle
That's important because it
means you have full access

00:25:00.716 --> 00:25:03.186 A:middle
to your project and you can make
any automated changes you want

00:25:03.186 --> 00:25:04.826 A:middle
to do before the build
actually happens.

00:25:05.416 --> 00:25:09.186 A:middle
And triggers that run after
integration can be gated

00:25:09.186 --> 00:25:10.526 A:middle
on the result of
that integration,

00:25:10.526 --> 00:25:13.166 A:middle
so they can run perhaps
only on success or only

00:25:13.166 --> 00:25:14.286 A:middle
when test failures happen.

00:25:14.726 --> 00:25:17.526 A:middle
And they also have access
to a lot of information

00:25:17.726 --> 00:25:19.306 A:middle
about what happened
in your integration.

00:25:19.866 --> 00:25:23.806 A:middle
And one of the ways we provide
access to that information is

00:25:23.806 --> 00:25:24.946 A:middle
through environment variables.

00:25:25.586 --> 00:25:29.136 A:middle
This is just a sample of some of
the variables that are defined

00:25:29.136 --> 00:25:29.986 A:middle
when your scripts run.

00:25:30.276 --> 00:25:31.966 A:middle
Any scripting language
worth using is going

00:25:31.966 --> 00:25:32.946 A:middle
to give you an easy way to get

00:25:32.946 --> 00:25:34.856 A:middle
at those environment
variables and use them.

00:25:36.376 --> 00:25:38.016 A:middle
So as an example of what
you can do with these,

00:25:38.316 --> 00:25:42.236 A:middle
last year we demonstrated a
trigger that posted a message

00:25:42.236 --> 00:25:44.506 A:middle
to a jabber chat room every
time an integration completed.

00:25:44.796 --> 00:25:46.636 A:middle
We used the bot name,
integration number,

00:25:46.636 --> 00:25:48.016 A:middle
and result to do that.

00:25:49.196 --> 00:25:52.166 A:middle
It was really easy,
very quick to set up.

00:25:53.296 --> 00:25:55.856 A:middle
There's two things up
here that I think I want

00:25:55.856 --> 00:25:56.696 A:middle
to call your attention to,

00:25:56.696 --> 00:25:58.386 A:middle
because they seem a little
weird and out of place.

00:25:59.026 --> 00:26:01.056 A:middle
So we have a bot ID
and integration ID



00:25:59.026 --> 00:26:01.056 A:middle
So we have a bot ID
and integration ID

00:26:01.056 --> 00:26:03.456 A:middle
for the integration
running and its bot.

00:26:03.836 --> 00:26:06.166 A:middle
That's a little weird if
this is all we give you.

00:26:06.356 --> 00:26:07.886 A:middle
You can't really do
much with just an ID.

00:26:07.886 --> 00:26:09.546 A:middle
It's an arbitrary
string of characters.

00:26:10.306 --> 00:26:10.936 A:middle
What good is that?

00:26:10.936 --> 00:26:12.076 A:middle
No user wants to see that.

00:26:13.546 --> 00:26:16.076 A:middle
So they don't do a lot on their
own but are very interesting

00:26:16.076 --> 00:26:17.686 A:middle
when combined with
the Xcode Server API.

00:26:18.466 --> 00:26:22.886 A:middle
So the Xcode Server API
forms the underpinnings

00:26:22.886 --> 00:26:25.576 A:middle
of how the Xcode ID and
Xcode Server communicate.

00:26:25.876 --> 00:26:28.226 A:middle
You can also harness
this API for your own use

00:26:28.616 --> 00:26:30.746 A:middle
and do some pretty
interesting things with it.

00:26:31.696 --> 00:26:34.776 A:middle
So like most web services
APIs, it's built off of open,

00:26:34.866 --> 00:26:36.036 A:middle
well-established standards.

00:26:37.546 --> 00:26:40.636 A:middle
We use HTTPS to do secure
communication back and forth

00:26:40.676 --> 00:26:41.676 A:middle
between client and server.

00:26:41.866 --> 00:26:43.146 A:middle
And we use basic authentication

00:26:43.146 --> 00:26:46.036 A:middle
over that encrypted
channel for authentication.

00:26:46.596 --> 00:26:52.106 A:middle
Our API follows a REST pattern,
so it's all about interacting

00:26:52.106 --> 00:26:54.036 A:middle
with resources, like
bots and integrations

00:26:54.256 --> 00:26:57.856 A:middle
and using the standard HTTP
verbs like get, post, patch,

00:26:57.856 --> 00:27:02.866 A:middle
and delete, to perform
operations on those resources.



00:26:57.856 --> 00:27:02.866 A:middle
and delete, to perform
operations on those resources.

00:27:04.436 --> 00:27:07.556 A:middle
And of course, we communicate
data back and forth using JSON.

00:27:07.816 --> 00:27:09.526 A:middle
It's easy to use,
it's easy to parse,

00:27:09.526 --> 00:27:11.296 A:middle
it's the lingua franca
of Web Services.

00:27:11.486 --> 00:27:12.886 A:middle
Everybody is using it.

00:27:14.976 --> 00:27:17.696 A:middle
This is great news for
you, the aspiring extender

00:27:17.696 --> 00:27:20.586 A:middle
of Xcode Server because it
means no matter your preferred

00:27:20.586 --> 00:27:21.946 A:middle
programming language
or environment,

00:27:22.316 --> 00:27:24.806 A:middle
you surely have a way
to speak HTTPS and JSON,

00:27:25.266 --> 00:27:31.056 A:middle
which means you can make almost
anything talk to Xcode Server.

00:27:31.186 --> 00:27:33.796 A:middle
Let's walk through how
we might use this API.

00:27:34.356 --> 00:27:37.106 A:middle
So what's the simplest question
we could ask our server?

00:27:37.796 --> 00:27:40.646 A:middle
Let's start with what
bots are on my server?

00:27:41.056 --> 00:27:42.366 A:middle
And this is very easy to do.

00:27:42.496 --> 00:27:44.656 A:middle
We make a get request
to the bots resource.

00:27:45.416 --> 00:27:48.076 A:middle
If you look at the URL there,
you will see that we communicate

00:27:48.076 --> 00:27:52.776 A:middle
over port 20,343, and all our
API requests have a /api prefix.

00:27:53.416 --> 00:27:56.506 A:middle
It's not important here,
but I want you to remember

00:27:56.506 --> 00:27:59.876 A:middle
that when you try out the API
yourself on your own server.



00:28:00.386 --> 00:28:04.056 A:middle
When we make that request,
we get a JSON object

00:28:04.056 --> 00:28:05.976 A:middle
that tells us the count
of the results we have

00:28:06.226 --> 00:28:08.066 A:middle
and gives us an array of
the results themselves.

00:28:09.206 --> 00:28:11.056 A:middle
Each of these JSON
objects represents one

00:28:11.056 --> 00:28:13.416 A:middle
of the bots that's set up
and configured on our server.

00:28:14.416 --> 00:28:17.656 A:middle
Like most resources, bots
have an ID, they have a name

00:28:17.946 --> 00:28:20.216 A:middle
like you gave it in Xcode
when you created it,

00:28:20.216 --> 00:28:21.956 A:middle
and they have all the
configuration parameters

00:28:22.676 --> 00:28:25.126 A:middle
that you set up when you
are setting up your bot.

00:28:26.316 --> 00:28:26.836 A:middle
All right.

00:28:26.836 --> 00:28:27.816 A:middle
So what's something
else we can do?

00:28:27.816 --> 00:28:28.676 A:middle
Now that we have a bot,

00:28:29.046 --> 00:28:31.196 A:middle
let's see what integrations
have run for this bot.

00:28:32.636 --> 00:28:36.746 A:middle
So now we access the integration
subresource for that bot.

00:28:38.706 --> 00:28:40.896 A:middle
And we do that, we get
a very similar result

00:28:40.896 --> 00:28:44.306 A:middle
as what we saw before,
except now the results are --

00:28:44.306 --> 00:28:46.086 A:middle
represent integrations,
not bots.

00:28:47.506 --> 00:28:50.126 A:middle
But integrations are resources
as well, they also have IDs.

00:28:50.546 --> 00:28:53.696 A:middle
One interesting thing is that we
also keep a snapshot of the bot

00:28:53.956 --> 00:28:56.826 A:middle
on the integration, and that's
important because as your --

00:28:56.936 --> 00:28:58.726 A:middle
your project changes over time

00:28:58.896 --> 00:29:01.136 A:middle
or maybe you adopt new Xcode
features, things like that,



00:28:58.896 --> 00:29:01.136 A:middle
or maybe you adopt new Xcode
features, things like that,

00:29:01.456 --> 00:29:04.026 A:middle
the bot configuration might
change when you edit it,

00:29:04.026 --> 00:29:05.766 A:middle
so we store a snapshot
on the integration

00:29:05.766 --> 00:29:07.786 A:middle
so that you know exactly
how your bot was configured

00:29:07.976 --> 00:29:09.296 A:middle
when that integration ran.

00:29:09.886 --> 00:29:14.396 A:middle
So we also keep track of the
step in the build process

00:29:14.396 --> 00:29:15.326 A:middle
that your integration is at.

00:29:15.466 --> 00:29:17.226 A:middle
If it's completed, you
will see a result there,

00:29:17.546 --> 00:29:20.476 A:middle
and also a breakdown of all
the different issue types

00:29:20.726 --> 00:29:22.846 A:middle
that your integration can
produce and the changes

00:29:22.996 --> 00:29:24.736 A:middle
from the previous integration.

00:29:25.316 --> 00:29:29.096 A:middle
So these are both get
requests I've shown you so far.

00:29:29.196 --> 00:29:31.766 A:middle
That's great for
collecting information,

00:29:32.166 --> 00:29:34.256 A:middle
but if you are using the
API, you probably want

00:29:34.256 --> 00:29:35.196 A:middle
to do something with it.

00:29:36.166 --> 00:29:37.056 A:middle
So what's something we could do

00:29:37.056 --> 00:29:38.526 A:middle
to actually have an
impact on our server?

00:29:39.236 --> 00:29:41.086 A:middle
Well, we could trigger
an integration manually.

00:29:41.646 --> 00:29:44.086 A:middle
Maybe we have some kind of other
automated process that's not the

00:29:44.086 --> 00:29:46.506 A:middle
built-in scheduler in Xcode
Server, and we want to use

00:29:46.506 --> 00:29:49.036 A:middle
that to trigger integrations
for certain bots.

00:29:49.776 --> 00:29:51.066 A:middle
That's easy to do.

00:29:51.066 --> 00:29:52.516 A:middle
We can use the same URL

00:29:52.716 --> 00:29:55.906 A:middle
and change our HTTP
method to a post.

00:29:57.536 --> 00:29:59.836 A:middle
When we do that, we've
gone from saying I want

00:29:59.836 --> 00:30:01.666 A:middle
to list the integrations
for this bot to I want



00:29:59.836 --> 00:30:01.666 A:middle
to list the integrations
for this bot to I want

00:30:01.666 --> 00:30:05.246 A:middle
to create a new integration
for this bot.

00:30:05.446 --> 00:30:06.536 A:middle
If we make that request,

00:30:07.066 --> 00:30:08.856 A:middle
we get an object
representing an integration,

00:30:08.856 --> 00:30:11.226 A:middle
much like you saw before,
but a lot lighter this time.

00:30:11.506 --> 00:30:12.906 A:middle
There's a lot of
properties that get set

00:30:13.316 --> 00:30:15.466 A:middle
on the integration during
the process of building,

00:30:15.766 --> 00:30:17.496 A:middle
but this integration is
only in a pending state

00:30:17.716 --> 00:30:19.406 A:middle
until the builder picks
it up in the queue

00:30:19.406 --> 00:30:22.606 A:middle
and actually starts
running with it.

00:30:22.876 --> 00:30:26.076 A:middle
Now, most of the post end points
in our API actually require you

00:30:26.076 --> 00:30:27.986 A:middle
to put some JSON
data in the body

00:30:28.056 --> 00:30:31.266 A:middle
that says this is the
properties of this resource,

00:30:31.326 --> 00:30:34.576 A:middle
the attributes I want set
on the thing I am creating.

00:30:35.176 --> 00:30:37.016 A:middle
Integrations are a bit
of a special case here

00:30:37.376 --> 00:30:40.886 A:middle
because bots are
essentially already that.

00:30:41.256 --> 00:30:43.776 A:middle
They are already the template
for each new integration,

00:30:44.046 --> 00:30:45.506 A:middle
and so they know
everything they need to know

00:30:45.506 --> 00:30:46.646 A:middle
to create a new integration.

00:30:47.796 --> 00:30:50.146 A:middle
Or at least they know everything
they need in the general case.

00:30:50.386 --> 00:30:52.646 A:middle
You can have a bit of an
impact on your integrations.

00:30:52.646 --> 00:30:54.936 A:middle
For instance, if you want
to have an integration

00:30:54.936 --> 00:30:56.396 A:middle
that specifically runs cleanly

00:30:56.686 --> 00:30:59.746 A:middle
with no leftover build
artifacts, then you can do

00:30:59.746 --> 00:31:02.296 A:middle
that by passing some
JSON in the body to tell



00:30:59.746 --> 00:31:02.296 A:middle
that by passing some
JSON in the body to tell

00:31:02.426 --> 00:31:04.636 A:middle
that this integration
should clean before it runs.

00:31:05.156 --> 00:31:05.326 A:middle
All right.

00:31:06.396 --> 00:31:07.846 A:middle
So that's an example of some

00:31:07.846 --> 00:31:09.066 A:middle
of the things you
can do with our API.

00:31:09.446 --> 00:31:12.046 A:middle
Now I'd like to bring Eric back
up to do a demonstration of some

00:31:12.046 --> 00:31:13.376 A:middle
of these advanced
Xcode features.

00:31:14.516 --> 00:31:20.306 A:middle
[Applause]

00:31:20.806 --> 00:31:21.926 A:middle
&gt;&gt; ERIC DUDIAK: Thank
you again, Matt.

00:31:22.736 --> 00:31:23.986 A:middle
So like Matt said, we
are going to show some

00:31:23.986 --> 00:31:26.946 A:middle
of the advanced features of
Xcode Server with this project.

00:31:27.996 --> 00:31:30.576 A:middle
Now, like many of you,

00:31:30.826 --> 00:31:32.906 A:middle
we developed this
app both internally,

00:31:32.906 --> 00:31:35.446 A:middle
but we also distribute
it, and I want to be able

00:31:35.446 --> 00:31:37.366 A:middle
to easily differentiate
my internal builds

00:31:37.706 --> 00:31:38.716 A:middle
from my external builds.

00:31:39.596 --> 00:31:41.426 A:middle
Now, one common strategy
for that is if we look

00:31:41.426 --> 00:31:43.726 A:middle
at our Asset Catalog, we
see two different images.

00:31:43.916 --> 00:31:46.356 A:middle
In the first case, we see
the standard app icon,

00:31:46.356 --> 00:31:48.406 A:middle
which is this white coffee cup.

00:31:48.856 --> 00:31:51.696 A:middle
In the case of our
internal builds,

00:31:51.696 --> 00:31:55.386 A:middle
we want to always show this
icon as an internal flag

00:31:55.386 --> 00:31:56.556 A:middle
and a black coffee cup.

00:31:56.916 --> 00:31:59.606 A:middle
This way when we are running
internal builds on our device,



00:32:00.366 --> 00:32:01.266 A:middle
we know that they are internal

00:32:01.266 --> 00:32:02.996 A:middle
and not the ones we might have
shipped through the App Store

00:32:02.996 --> 00:32:05.636 A:middle
or somehow distributed
through our normal channels.

00:32:06.626 --> 00:32:08.796 A:middle
It's very useful so we
know when we find a bug,

00:32:09.416 --> 00:32:11.016 A:middle
we are hopefully the
only ones seeing it.

00:32:11.426 --> 00:32:14.356 A:middle
Now, the other way we want

00:32:14.356 --> 00:32:16.276 A:middle
to differentiate
our internal app is

00:32:16.276 --> 00:32:17.936 A:middle
that when we're running
internally,

00:32:18.456 --> 00:32:20.266 A:middle
we normally have
a settings bundle,

00:32:20.266 --> 00:32:23.096 A:middle
and in that settings bundle, we
define, like many applications,

00:32:23.096 --> 00:32:25.386 A:middle
a version, in this
case version 2.0,

00:32:25.386 --> 00:32:27.426 A:middle
since we've made some
recent major changes.

00:32:28.056 --> 00:32:31.176 A:middle
Now, 2.0 is perfectly sufficient
for our external users to see,

00:32:31.176 --> 00:32:33.576 A:middle
we'll bump this version every
time we submit to the App Store.

00:32:34.376 --> 00:32:35.196 A:middle
But for internal use,

00:32:35.196 --> 00:32:37.376 A:middle
we probably want a little bit
more fine-grain information.

00:32:37.566 --> 00:32:40.426 A:middle
More specifically, we want some
unique identifier for the build.

00:32:41.656 --> 00:32:43.706 A:middle
In this case, I think I
want to use Xcode Server

00:32:43.706 --> 00:32:44.716 A:middle
to actually distinguish

00:32:44.716 --> 00:32:48.746 A:middle
which integration the build
came from on my server.

00:32:48.746 --> 00:32:51.266 A:middle
I am going to go ahead
and go to the bot.

00:32:51.266 --> 00:32:54.216 A:middle
And this is the same
bot I was using before.

00:32:54.216 --> 00:32:55.866 A:middle
I am going to go into
the edit workflow.

00:32:56.406 --> 00:32:59.636 A:middle
And just like Matt said, this
is now completely nonlinear,



00:33:00.006 --> 00:33:02.536 A:middle
so since I am most
interested in the triggers,

00:33:02.536 --> 00:33:03.886 A:middle
I can jump straight there.

00:33:04.116 --> 00:33:05.406 A:middle
So let's take our first --

00:33:05.406 --> 00:33:07.686 A:middle
our first step is to
get the icon changed.

00:33:07.686 --> 00:33:10.416 A:middle
I am going to open up a trigger
script I have already written.

00:33:10.416 --> 00:33:12.486 A:middle
In this case, it's a
simple batch script

00:33:12.486 --> 00:33:14.626 A:middle
because all we are going to
do is simple file operations.

00:33:14.626 --> 00:33:18.996 A:middle
We are going to go ahead and
use the XES source directory

00:33:18.996 --> 00:33:22.596 A:middle
environment variable to figure
out the path to that app icon,

00:33:23.706 --> 00:33:25.736 A:middle
and we are going to go
ahead and delete it.

00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:28.276 A:middle
Then we are going to
take our server version

00:33:28.276 --> 00:33:29.516 A:middle
and move it into its place.

00:33:30.136 --> 00:33:32.126 A:middle
So this will be a before
integration trigger

00:33:32.126 --> 00:33:34.686 A:middle
because we want this to run
after our source code is checked

00:33:34.686 --> 00:33:37.156 A:middle
out and ready to build but
before we actually do build.

00:33:37.156 --> 00:33:39.056 A:middle
So I am going to
go ahead and copy

00:33:39.056 --> 00:33:41.136 A:middle
that as a run script trigger.

00:33:41.746 --> 00:33:45.356 A:middle
Now, setting up the
settings bundle is going

00:33:45.356 --> 00:33:46.516 A:middle
to be a little trickier.

00:33:46.516 --> 00:33:48.596 A:middle
I could do that with a batch
script, but that's editing a lot

00:33:48.596 --> 00:33:51.726 A:middle
of batch script code manually,
or letting a lot of plist code

00:33:51.726 --> 00:33:53.356 A:middle
in a batch script
would be painful.

00:33:53.356 --> 00:33:57.086 A:middle
So I am going to go ahead
and pull up a Swift trigger.

00:33:57.746 --> 00:34:00.766 A:middle
In this case, just like the bash
trigger, I go ahead and set it



00:33:57.746 --> 00:34:00.766 A:middle
In this case, just like the bash
trigger, I go ahead and set it

00:34:00.766 --> 00:34:03.286 A:middle
up using the hash bang
for user bin swift.

00:34:04.256 --> 00:34:07.546 A:middle
I haven't finished writing it,
so bear with me while I do that.

00:34:07.546 --> 00:34:10.226 A:middle
I am going to get
import foundation.

00:34:10.226 --> 00:34:10.846 A:middle
This is where I am going

00:34:10.846 --> 00:34:13.926 A:middle
to get all the extra
power I want from Swift.

00:34:14.716 --> 00:34:17.126 A:middle
With the foundation imported,
I am going to go ahead

00:34:17.126 --> 00:34:20.216 A:middle
and use NSProcess info to get
those environment variables

00:34:20.216 --> 00:34:22.366 A:middle
that I was using in the
other script through bash,

00:34:22.446 --> 00:34:24.906 A:middle
in this case, the
XCS source directory.

00:34:24.966 --> 00:34:30.755 A:middle
After that I am going to find
the settings bundle I had.

00:34:30.755 --> 00:34:33.076 A:middle
This is where things get
more interesting with Swift.

00:34:33.076 --> 00:34:37.085 A:middle
I can load the plist as a
dictionary right in Swift.

00:34:37.085 --> 00:34:38.896 A:middle
I don't have to do
any manual editing

00:34:38.896 --> 00:34:40.266 A:middle
of the plist file myself.

00:34:40.266 --> 00:34:43.806 A:middle
That gets particularly useful
when I want to add something

00:34:43.806 --> 00:34:47.516 A:middle
to it, I simply just create a
new dictionary literal in swift

00:34:48.196 --> 00:34:50.456 A:middle
and go ahead and shove
that into my dictionary.

00:34:51.565 --> 00:34:53.636 A:middle
Here we grab the
environment variable

00:34:53.636 --> 00:34:56.636 A:middle
for the integration number to
set as this build number title.

00:34:56.916 --> 00:35:01.046 A:middle
Finally, I am going to go
ahead and write that out



00:34:56.916 --> 00:35:01.046 A:middle
Finally, I am going to go
ahead and write that out

00:35:01.046 --> 00:35:02.826 A:middle
to disk before the
script finishes so that

00:35:02.826 --> 00:35:06.036 A:middle
when we actually go to
build, that will be picked

00:35:06.036 --> 00:35:07.316 A:middle
up in my settings bundle.

00:35:07.376 --> 00:35:12.026 A:middle
And to do that, I am just going
to add another trigger below.

00:35:12.026 --> 00:35:12.746 A:middle
All right.

00:35:13.816 --> 00:35:15.376 A:middle
So I now have two triggers.

00:35:15.826 --> 00:35:19.286 A:middle
Now, this is where I could
push the integrate now button

00:35:19.286 --> 00:35:21.186 A:middle
and get a new integration,
but I want to use some

00:35:21.186 --> 00:35:24.866 A:middle
of the API Matt was talking
about on the server to do that.

00:35:25.376 --> 00:35:28.386 A:middle
I am going to go ahead and pull
up another application I have.

00:35:28.386 --> 00:35:32.856 A:middle
And if we look here,
we see an application

00:35:32.856 --> 00:35:34.066 A:middle
that actually is connected

00:35:34.066 --> 00:35:36.006 A:middle
to a serial device
plugged into my computer.

00:35:37.066 --> 00:35:40.966 A:middle
And it's using some of
the I/O kit sample code,

00:35:40.966 --> 00:35:42.896 A:middle
and we are just going
to read that buffer,

00:35:42.996 --> 00:35:45.216 A:middle
and whenever we see something
on it, we are going to go ahead

00:35:45.216 --> 00:35:46.216 A:middle
and run through this
block of code.

00:35:46.216 --> 00:35:50.156 A:middle
So I am going to open up an
NSURL session, and I am going

00:35:50.156 --> 00:35:52.276 A:middle
to call the API for
getting all of the bots.

00:35:52.876 --> 00:35:54.236 A:middle
This is just local host.

00:35:54.236 --> 00:35:57.016 A:middle
The port Matt mentioned
earlier, API/bots,

00:35:57.176 --> 00:35:58.966 A:middle
and it's going to
be the get method.

00:35:59.266 --> 00:36:00.646 A:middle
I go ahead and call that,



00:35:59.266 --> 00:36:00.646 A:middle
I go ahead and call that,

00:36:00.646 --> 00:36:04.626 A:middle
and using the NS JSON
serialization API, go ahead

00:36:04.626 --> 00:36:09.226 A:middle
and read in each bot and find
the ID for coffee board bot.

00:36:09.226 --> 00:36:11.186 A:middle
That's the bot I
want to integrate.

00:36:12.676 --> 00:36:15.116 A:middle
With that ID, I am going
to build up a new URL

00:36:15.116 --> 00:36:16.536 A:middle
like Matt was showing earlier

00:36:16.856 --> 00:36:22.896 A:middle
with the bots/my
UUID/integrations and switch

00:36:22.896 --> 00:36:25.256 A:middle
that request to be a post
request, so this is going

00:36:25.256 --> 00:36:26.636 A:middle
to create a new integration.

00:36:26.896 --> 00:36:27.696 A:middle
For the purpose of this,

00:36:27.696 --> 00:36:29.546 A:middle
we don't really care what the
integration is going to do.

00:36:30.456 --> 00:36:31.846 A:middle
Now, in order to trigger this,

00:36:32.776 --> 00:36:35.076 A:middle
I managed to sneak past
security a fun little button,

00:36:35.876 --> 00:36:39.106 A:middle
and this button, I am going
to plug it into my Mac.

00:36:40.816 --> 00:36:43.226 A:middle
And I am going to
run this application.

00:36:43.816 --> 00:36:47.006 A:middle
Let's try that one more time.

00:36:52.736 --> 00:36:54.696 A:middle
Make sure it's fully
connected before I run.

00:36:54.696 --> 00:36:56.236 A:middle
Don't want to get
ahead of myself.

00:36:56.236 --> 00:36:56.586 A:middle
All right.

00:36:56.586 --> 00:36:59.216 A:middle
Good. So that application
is now running.

00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:00.436 A:middle
We have the modem picked up.



00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:00.436 A:middle
We have the modem picked up.

00:37:00.436 --> 00:37:04.516 A:middle
So I am just going to zoom in
here on my bot and step away

00:37:04.516 --> 00:37:07.496 A:middle
for a second, and
just with the button,

00:37:08.576 --> 00:37:09.446 A:middle
create a new integration.

00:37:10.516 --> 00:37:16.426 A:middle
[Applause]

00:37:16.926 --> 00:37:18.846 A:middle
So that was entirely with
the button in our API.

00:37:18.846 --> 00:37:21.256 A:middle
I am not going to wait for
that integration to finish just

00:37:21.256 --> 00:37:24.396 A:middle
to show you what happened,
here we see the integration,

00:37:24.396 --> 00:37:27.296 A:middle
I can install that on my local
device I was using earlier

00:37:27.296 --> 00:37:27.876 A:middle
to test.

00:37:29.266 --> 00:37:34.606 A:middle
Install. And if I open up
QuickTime to see the --

00:37:35.756 --> 00:37:37.446 A:middle
so you guys can see
what I see -- all right.

00:37:42.116 --> 00:37:43.146 A:middle
There's my device.

00:37:44.356 --> 00:37:46.466 A:middle
You see that we have the
internal icon on the device,

00:37:46.466 --> 00:37:48.006 A:middle
even though I never
switched it locally.

00:37:48.006 --> 00:37:51.256 A:middle
We downloaded it from the
server, and now our app,

00:37:51.256 --> 00:37:52.486 A:middle
we know, is an internal build.

00:37:52.486 --> 00:37:54.966 A:middle
So that's some of the
more advanced features

00:37:54.966 --> 00:37:56.836 A:middle
of Xcode Server, and I am going

00:37:56.836 --> 00:38:00.246 A:middle
to let Matt talk a little bit
more about where you can find us



00:37:56.836 --> 00:38:00.246 A:middle
to let Matt talk a little bit
more about where you can find us

00:38:00.246 --> 00:38:01.526 A:middle
in the labs and things
like that.

00:38:02.406 --> 00:38:02.896 A:middle
Matt?

00:38:03.516 --> 00:38:08.686 A:middle
[Applause]

00:38:09.186 --> 00:38:09.766 A:middle
&gt;&gt; MATT MORIARITY: All right.

00:38:10.056 --> 00:38:10.586 A:middle
Thank you, Eric.

00:38:10.586 --> 00:38:11.706 A:middle
That was great.

00:38:11.946 --> 00:38:14.526 A:middle
I love pressing big red
buttons to make integrations.

00:38:15.036 --> 00:38:17.336 A:middle
All right.

00:38:17.886 --> 00:38:20.886 A:middle
So here are some more of the
endpoints we have available

00:38:20.886 --> 00:38:24.596 A:middle
in our API, at least to you
guys, developers out there.

00:38:24.986 --> 00:38:28.046 A:middle
There's a few more that are
available, but they're locked

00:38:28.046 --> 00:38:29.756 A:middle
down so that they
are internal use.

00:38:29.756 --> 00:38:31.056 A:middle
We want to be really
secure and make sure

00:38:31.056 --> 00:38:33.096 A:middle
that integrations
don't get messed

00:38:33.096 --> 00:38:34.996 A:middle
with too much while
they are running,

00:38:36.476 --> 00:38:38.586 A:middle
especially with the
client server interaction

00:38:38.796 --> 00:38:40.666 A:middle
where you might have your
server exposed in more places

00:38:40.726 --> 00:38:42.656 A:middle
than just your network.

00:38:43.606 --> 00:38:46.116 A:middle
But I encourage you to
reference this slide later

00:38:46.626 --> 00:38:49.886 A:middle
when we've uploaded the videos
and the slides and try out some

00:38:49.886 --> 00:38:51.606 A:middle
of these endpoints
yourself on your own servers

00:38:51.836 --> 00:38:52.916 A:middle
and see what you
can come up with

00:38:53.216 --> 00:38:54.626 A:middle
and what's interesting
for your team.

00:38:55.126 --> 00:38:55.286 A:middle
All right.

00:38:57.076 --> 00:39:00.786 A:middle
So today we looked at Xcode
Server improvements we've made



00:38:57.076 --> 00:39:00.786 A:middle
So today we looked at Xcode
Server improvements we've made

00:39:00.786 --> 00:39:02.786 A:middle
in Xcode 7, both around quality

00:39:02.946 --> 00:39:06.076 A:middle
and adopting new testing
features that have been added

00:39:06.076 --> 00:39:08.846 A:middle
in Xcode 7, especially the
new code coverage feature

00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:11.666 A:middle
that makes it really great
for measuring how much

00:39:11.666 --> 00:39:13.856 A:middle
of your applications code
is actually getting used

00:39:13.856 --> 00:39:14.346 A:middle
by your tests.

00:39:14.346 --> 00:39:17.316 A:middle
And we, of course, showed
you two great new ways

00:39:17.606 --> 00:39:20.166 A:middle
to extend Xcode Server
and integrate it better

00:39:20.166 --> 00:39:23.796 A:middle
with your team with triggers
and the Xcode Server API.

00:39:24.336 --> 00:39:27.656 A:middle
So for more information,
we have a --

00:39:27.656 --> 00:39:30.776 A:middle
there's a Continuous Integration
Guide on the developer library,

00:39:31.266 --> 00:39:33.246 A:middle
and of course, you can
come post any questions

00:39:33.296 --> 00:39:34.226 A:middle
to the developer forums.

00:39:34.796 --> 00:39:37.856 A:middle
There's a few related sessions.

00:39:38.126 --> 00:39:40.386 A:middle
Both of them have
already happened,

00:39:40.556 --> 00:39:42.036 A:middle
some more recently than others.

00:39:42.766 --> 00:39:46.086 A:middle
UI Testing in Xcode was
yesterday, but I encourage you

00:39:46.086 --> 00:39:46.966 A:middle
to go look at that video.

00:39:47.186 --> 00:39:48.786 A:middle
We touched on UI
testing but we didn't get

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:50.196 A:middle
to demonstrate how
it works in Server.

00:39:50.506 --> 00:39:53.556 A:middle
It is pretty automatic, but
the UI testing feature is great

00:39:53.556 --> 00:39:55.996 A:middle
and I encourage you
to try it out.

00:39:55.996 --> 00:39:58.036 A:middle
If you want to know more
about getting started

00:39:58.036 --> 00:40:00.976 A:middle
with Xcode Server, last
year we demonstrated setting



00:39:58.036 --> 00:40:00.976 A:middle
with Xcode Server, last
year we demonstrated setting

00:40:00.976 --> 00:40:03.516 A:middle
up your server from scratch
and getting your bots set

00:40:03.516 --> 00:40:05.816 A:middle
up initially in the
Continuous Integration

00:40:05.816 --> 00:40:07.206 A:middle
with Xcode 6 session.

00:40:08.616 --> 00:40:09.976 A:middle
Thank you, everyone.

00:40:09.976 --> 00:40:10.976 A:middle
Have a great rest of your WWDC.

00:40:11.508 --> 00:40:13.508 A:middle
[Applause]
