>> JEFFREY TRAER
BERNSTEIN: Hello, everyone.


3
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:30,446
And welcome to designing
for future hardware.


4
00:00:31,566 --> 00:00:32,946
I'm Jeffrey Traer Bernstein.


5
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:36,096
With me are Matthaeus
Krenn and Bill Lindmeier.


6
00:00:37,906 --> 00:00:38,856
Who is this session for?


7
00:00:39,716 --> 00:00:44,296
Perhaps you're creating
a device that's connected


8
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,926
to an application.


9
00:00:46,836 --> 00:00:53,126
That device could be, say,
a dishwasher that you would


10
00:00:53,126 --> 00:00:54,706
like to control from
your application.


11
00:00:55,866 --> 00:00:58,926
Or maybe it's a drone you would
like to control from an app.


12
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:01,506
Or maybe a golf club that
would send information


13
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:03,136
about your swing back
to an application.


14
00:01:04,275 --> 00:01:06,046
Perhaps you have an
application and you would


15
00:01:06,046 --> 00:01:07,126
like to create a device for it.


16
00:01:08,146 --> 00:01:10,676
Maybe it's a game you would like
to create a custom controller


17
00:01:10,676 --> 00:01:13,546
for or a messaging application.


18
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:15,866
Or maybe a device to
go with a dating app.


19
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:16,796
Who knows what that would be.


20
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:21,806
You might also find this
useful if you are designing


21
00:01:21,936 --> 00:01:25,176
for a device you just don't have
yet like perhaps an Apple Watch


22
00:01:25,426 --> 00:01:27,986
or some fancy new
thing we've released.


23
00:01:28,636 --> 00:01:29,146
Who are we?


24
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:32,896
We are a team of inventors,
designers, prototypers.


25
00:01:33,606 --> 00:01:35,296
We work across all
of Apple's products


26
00:01:36,016 --> 00:01:38,686
and explore what new
interfaces mean to our devices,


27
00:01:38,736 --> 00:01:40,686
operating systems
and applications.


28
00:01:41,546 --> 00:01:44,246
We brought you exciting features
such as Multitouch gestures,


29
00:01:44,676 --> 00:01:46,286
Force Touch and a Taptic Engine.


30
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:52,356
This time last year we did
Prototyping at WWDC 2014.


31
00:01:52,406 --> 00:01:53,976
Was anyone there for it?

[ Cheering ]


33
00:01:56,526 --> 00:01:57,326
>> JEFFREY TRAER BERNSTEIN:
Thank you - excellent.


34
00:01:57,636 --> 00:01:58,416
Thank you for joining us.


35
00:01:58,896 --> 00:02:00,016
Did anyone watch it online?


36
00:02:02,826 --> 00:02:03,786
Less people, all right.


37
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:08,136
Well, it is not required
for this session,


38
00:02:08,136 --> 00:02:09,545
but I suggest you check
it out afterwards.


39
00:02:10,056 --> 00:02:12,326
I'll give you a brief
synopsis right now.


40
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:15,206
We unveiled a disruptive,


41
00:02:15,406 --> 00:02:17,816
revolutionary new
application called Toast Modern


42
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,706
that allowed you to browse for
artisanal, overpriced toast


43
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:23,046
on the streets of San Francisco,


44
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:27,506
take photos of the toast
you're eating, and share it


45
00:02:27,506 --> 00:02:28,656
with your friends
and loved ones.


46
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:32,766
We used this application to
explain why to Prototype.


47
00:02:33,056 --> 00:02:34,376
There are two important reasons.


48
00:02:34,726 --> 00:02:37,206
One, test ideas to save time


49
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:39,156
and money building the right
things for your products.


50
00:02:39,456 --> 00:02:42,806
Number two is to get new
ideas to make the experience


51
00:02:42,806 --> 00:02:44,026
of your product even better.


52
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,156
We also talked about
how to Prototype.


53
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:53,206
Make fake apps, show people,
and learn from their feedback,


54
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,946
and do it over and over
again until the experience


55
00:02:55,946 --> 00:02:57,116
of your product is incredible.


56
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,156
As you might have
imagined, the reception


57
00:03:01,156 --> 00:03:02,566
on the Internet was incredible.


58
00:03:02,736 --> 00:03:03,786
People said things like,


59
00:03:03,786 --> 00:03:05,596
"The workflow shown is
something I may try."


60
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:06,916
(Laughter)


61
00:03:07,016 --> 00:03:08,066
>> JEFFREY TRAER BERNSTEIN:


62
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:10,186
The Prototyping video
for WWDC is great.


63
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:11,286
"Grab a plate of toast."


64
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,736
" Takeaways: Number one, make
fake apps; number two, um...


65
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,356
missed that part."


66
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:18,216
"I'm so proud of you."


67
00:03:18,216 --> 00:03:18,526
My mom.


68
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:24,546
So today, you're all very
fortunate to be here.


69
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:26,976
We are going to unveil
a brand new,


70
00:03:27,176 --> 00:03:29,316
revolutionary Toast
Modern product


71
00:03:29,606 --> 00:03:32,936
that builds upon the success of
Toast Modern, the application.


72
00:03:33,976 --> 00:03:37,966
We are going to give you a peek
behind the curtain, a little bit


73
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:40,086
of how Apple and partners
prototype the watch.


74
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:44,086
We're going to create a device
and an app that connects to it.


75
00:03:44,086 --> 00:03:47,366
We're going to show you along
the way a few prototyping


76
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:49,106
strategies for hardware
and software.


77
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:54,656
I would like to share our
Toast Modern product today.


78
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:55,576

81
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:10,096
It's a revolutionary,
disruptive, connected, social,

00:04:11,326 --> 00:04:22,646
big data-y Internet of
Things thing and this is it.

85
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:26,976
Thank you very much.

[ Applause ]


87
00:05:32,956 --> 00:05:37,046
So we call this Toastal Service.


88
00:05:40,036 --> 00:05:43,866
It is the world's
first social toaster.


89
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:48,286
It allows you to
send Toast messages


90
00:05:48,286 --> 00:05:50,826
to your friends and loved ones.


91
00:05:51,876 --> 00:05:56,036
Of course, it's available in
three great colors: Silver,


92
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,686
Space Grey and 18-Karat gold.

[ Applause ]


94
00:06:07,516 --> 00:06:08,906
>> JEFFREY TRAER BERNSTEIN:
So we have an iPhone


95
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,206
and we have a Toaster.


96
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:13,336
Both have excellent
qualities to recommend them.


97
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,616
The iPhone has a
great interface.


98
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:17,996
It is connected to the Internet.


99
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,276
And it's always with you.


100
00:06:20,736 --> 00:06:23,476
Our toaster can turn
bread into toast.


101
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:27,066
So we want to combine
the capabilities of each.


102
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:30,806
We want to blur the lines
between hardware and software,


103
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:32,506
create a perfect
meld of the two.


104
00:06:33,086 --> 00:06:35,976
I can think of another
product that has done the same.


105
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:38,946
That is the Apple Watch.


106
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:44,236
Now, you might think that
at Apple we would begin here


107
00:06:44,766 --> 00:06:48,056
with the fully formed Apple
Watch springs from the brain


108
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:50,116
of its designers and is
carved out of aluminum,


109
00:06:50,206 --> 00:06:50,876
and sent to all of you.


110
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:56,036
In reality, we actually
begin by drawing the Watch


111
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:59,276
on another device so we can
experiment with the interface.


112
00:06:59,926 --> 00:07:03,726
This is a pretty well formed
watch as it exists today.


113
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:09,526
We start with this, a rectangle,
and we use this platform


114
00:07:09,526 --> 00:07:11,976
to experiment with the different
things we might need to add


115
00:07:11,976 --> 00:07:13,556
to the Watch to make
the experience great.


116
00:07:14,426 --> 00:07:16,816
We might add a Digital Crown
that we draw on the screen


117
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:20,866
and scroll over to understand
how that works and experiment


118
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:21,796
with different buttons.


119
00:07:22,796 --> 00:07:26,876
This is great, teaches us a ton
about the interface of the Watch


120
00:07:26,976 --> 00:07:28,556
and the experience of using it.


121
00:07:28,976 --> 00:07:33,436
But you can't strap an iPhone
to your wrist and go outside


122
00:07:33,556 --> 00:07:34,666
and try it in context.


123
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:39,216
So some of our app partners
when they were developing


124
00:07:39,216 --> 00:07:41,346
for the Watch before
Watches were available


125
00:07:41,346 --> 00:07:42,876
to them did some clever things.


126
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:46,596
For example, this
French Transit app.


127
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:48,456
They created their
own Apple Watch.


128
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,966
It is more rustic but useful.


129
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:55,336
They drew some pictures of
their different screens.


130
00:07:56,406 --> 00:07:58,276
And then slid them
inside of the watch.


131
00:07:58,316 --> 00:07:59,116
This was important.


132
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:00,636
This is a Transit app.


133
00:08:00,636 --> 00:08:03,286
I need to be able to see
what it's like to run


134
00:08:03,286 --> 00:08:04,826
for the train I'm late for


135
00:08:05,106 --> 00:08:06,846
and see what train
I'm going to catch.


136
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:08,356
They have to try it in context.


137
00:08:09,506 --> 00:08:11,826
The German newspaper Bild
printed out a picture


138
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:15,486
of an Apple Watch and slid
underneath various screens.


139
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:18,836
It was important for them
to test the legibility


140
00:08:19,096 --> 00:08:20,916
of their articles in the places


141
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:24,666
where they expect
people to read them.


142
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:26,126
We learned a few things


143
00:08:26,126 --> 00:08:28,136
about Prototyping
hardware and software.


144
00:08:29,506 --> 00:08:31,716
We learned we can fake
hardware on screens


145
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:33,176
as with the Apple Watch.


146
00:08:33,756 --> 00:08:36,576
We can fake software
with pictures


147
00:08:36,806 --> 00:08:38,596
as we explained last
year with Toast Modern,


148
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:43,736
and it is important to try it
in context at the right size,


149
00:08:43,986 --> 00:08:46,936
in the right place as you saw
with the paper Watch Prototypes.


150
00:08:47,546 --> 00:08:51,346
Here is our prototyping
cycle from last year:


151
00:08:51,346 --> 00:08:53,306
make fake things,
show them to people


152
00:08:53,306 --> 00:08:54,496
and learn from their feedback.


153
00:08:55,676 --> 00:08:58,576
This year we are going to make
fake hardware and software.


154
00:08:59,386 --> 00:09:00,466
Before we begin we are going


155
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:03,256
to ask ourselves three important
questions for each of those.


156
00:09:04,396 --> 00:09:05,666
What needs to be more real?


157
00:09:07,236 --> 00:09:08,136
What can be faked?


158
00:09:08,316 --> 00:09:10,746
That's nearly everything except
for the one thing we are going


159
00:09:10,746 --> 00:09:13,836
to choose to be real, and
where will it be used?


160
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:16,896
And then we are going to
go and show it to people.


161
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:20,326
Who do we show it to?


162
00:09:21,236 --> 00:09:22,516
The people you app is for.


163
00:09:22,826 --> 00:09:24,656
If it's not meant
for your office mate,


164
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:25,756
go find the people it's for.


165
00:09:26,856 --> 00:09:29,976
Where? In the place
where people will use it.


166
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:31,306
You might have to go outside.


167
00:09:31,926 --> 00:09:37,166
And remember, don't
argue, defend, or dismiss.


168
00:09:37,556 --> 00:09:39,256
You're there to learn
from people's impression


169
00:09:39,256 --> 00:09:40,466
of the Prototype
you put together.


170
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:45,156
After we've shown it to people,
we learn from their feedback.


171
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:49,076
We ask ourselves
three questions:


172
00:09:49,606 --> 00:09:50,826
Number one, what is working?


173
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,056
Number two, what is not working?


174
00:09:53,346 --> 00:09:56,946
Number 3, what other
ideas does this give us?


175
00:09:57,946 --> 00:10:00,556
Now we are going to go through
the cycle three times today


176
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:02,186
and show you a few
different techniques.


177
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:05,066
We are going to begin with
pictures and animation.


178
00:10:05,686 --> 00:10:07,796
Then we are going to use
a technique we call behind


179
00:10:07,796 --> 00:10:08,186
the curtain.


180
00:10:09,186 --> 00:10:12,316
After that we are going to
create a lightweight interactive


181
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:13,446
and connected prototype.


182
00:10:13,996 --> 00:10:17,746
I would like to quickly recap
Toastal Service for you guys.


183
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:21,126
It's the world's
first social toaster.


184
00:10:22,226 --> 00:10:24,596
Allows you to receive toast
messages, we call them Toasties,


185
00:10:26,316 --> 00:10:27,506
and send toast messages,


186
00:10:28,136 --> 00:10:30,586
and we want that
experience to be magical.


187
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:33,846
To kick it off, I'd like to
ask Matthaeus up to the stage.


188
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:39,436
[ Applause ]


189
00:10:39,936 --> 00:10:40,316
>> MATTHAEUS KRENN:
Thanks, Jeff.


190
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:46,216
Cool. So how are we going
to get started with this?


191
00:10:46,476 --> 00:10:50,666
So first of all, let's look
at our hardware and our app


192
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,026
and ask ourselves the question
that Jeff just mentioned.


193
00:10:53,626 --> 00:10:56,646
First of all, what do
we make more real now?


194
00:10:56,646 --> 00:11:02,176
Well, I want us actually
to start with the receiving


195
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,346
and the Toasting part
of the experience.


196
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,856
So on the hardware, let's figure
out a way how we can indicate


197
00:11:07,856 --> 00:11:09,846
that a new Toastie
has been received.


198
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:14,026
On the app we can look at
new Toastie notifications


199
00:11:14,546 --> 00:11:19,256
and see what kind of information
the app can display with it.


200
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,546
The next question is,
what can be faked?


201
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:26,136
And really here just go for
as much as possible really.


202
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:28,146
We are not going
to build a Toaster.


203
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,666
We are not going to look at
how to turn bread into Toast.


204
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,576
All we are going to do is
put pictures on the device


205
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:35,016
and simulate the
hardware like that.


206
00:11:36,056 --> 00:11:39,896
For the app again,
everything we are going


207
00:11:39,896 --> 00:11:41,586
to take pictures for everything.


208
00:11:41,586 --> 00:11:43,926
We are not going to make
anything really interactive


209
00:11:43,926 --> 00:11:45,906
and definitely not
writing any code.


210
00:11:48,456 --> 00:11:50,906
And third, where will
the product be used?


211
00:11:51,816 --> 00:11:54,686
For the Toaster,
that's the kitchen.


212
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,476
For the app it's anywhere
or at least anywhere


213
00:11:57,476 --> 00:11:58,416
around the house for sure.


214
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:03,346
So let's start with
looking at our Toaster.


215
00:12:03,896 --> 00:12:08,206
We said that we wanted
to simulate hardware


216
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:09,626
by putting pictures on a screen.


217
00:12:09,676 --> 00:12:13,506
That sounds awfully a lot
like what Jeff just described


218
00:12:13,606 --> 00:12:16,546
with the Apple Watch
on an iPhone.


219
00:12:17,816 --> 00:12:20,946
Luckily Apple also makes a great
Toaster shaped product called


220
00:12:20,946 --> 00:12:21,296
the iPad.


221
00:12:22,736 --> 00:12:24,526
That is just the right
thing for us here.


222
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:29,126
To sketch out our Toaster, I'm
going to use keynote today.


223
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:34,406
For you really, whatever gets
you started easily and simply,


224
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:36,246
I'm going to use keynote today.


225
00:12:36,246 --> 00:12:37,836
Feel free to use
whatever you can.


226
00:12:38,576 --> 00:12:42,256
I'm going to try to keep it
as simple as possible too.


227
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:47,876
A Toaster is really just
a box, some feet, a lever,


228
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:50,886
maybe we will actually
call this a digital lever.


229
00:12:52,496 --> 00:12:55,046
And a slot where you can
put in a piece of bread.


230
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:58,036
We also said that we
wanted to indicate


231
00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:00,656
when a new Toastie
has been received.


232
00:13:00,766 --> 00:13:03,416
We'll put an LED up
there that can light up.


233
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:07,626
And while we are in
keynote, we are also going


234
00:13:07,626 --> 00:13:09,476
to add some bread
to the Toaster.


235
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,926
This is the Toaster toasting.


236
00:13:12,646 --> 00:13:15,196
And eventually the
Toastie pops back up


237
00:13:15,196 --> 00:13:17,256
and we can see what's on it.


238
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:18,186
We can take this.


239
00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:21,136
We can open it in
keynote on our iPad.


240
00:13:21,246 --> 00:13:22,876
And we have a Toaster.


241
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:27,276
For our app we are going
to do something similar.


242
00:13:27,276 --> 00:13:30,136
We are going to get started with
a home screen, a screen shot


243
00:13:30,136 --> 00:13:34,776
of a home screen on the iPhone
and put our app icon on it.


244
00:13:34,776 --> 00:13:39,296
We are going to take a screen
shot and use it as an underlay


245
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:41,236
for an application that
we want to customize.


246
00:13:42,746 --> 00:13:43,286
That's simple.


247
00:13:43,286 --> 00:13:48,476
For our app, we're going to take
a screen shot of Toast Modern,


248
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:50,606
the product that we
unveiled last year.


249
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:55,576
You can see in the top left
corner there's a convenient open


250
00:13:55,576 --> 00:14:00,096
spot that is the perfect place
for the link to our Toast inbox.


251
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:04,656
I'll put a Toaster icon up there
and a little notification badge.


252
00:14:06,326 --> 00:14:10,426
On the Toaster inbox
I'm going to use a slice


253
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:13,186
of bread right now as a place
holder because I don't want


254
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,926
to take away what is
actually on the Toastie.


255
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:18,046
We don't want to take
away the anticipation,


256
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:20,346
that surprise moment when
you are sitting waiting


257
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:21,566
for your Toast to be toasted.


258
00:14:22,506 --> 00:14:25,816
We definitely want to show
who is this Toastie from?


259
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:29,786
We will put a picture and
name of the sender up there.


260
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:33,366
And we are also going to add the
date and time when it was sent.


261
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:36,166
At this point I think
it would be great


262
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,206
if we can immediately also
choose how dark we want our


263
00:14:39,206 --> 00:14:40,316
bread to be Toasted.


264
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:46,376
We can do that easily
with a slider here.


265
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:52,086
Now, again let's open that on
our iPhone and see what it looks


266
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:54,106
like on an actual device.


267
00:14:55,756 --> 00:14:58,596
This immediately gives
us a really life like


268
00:14:58,596 --> 00:15:01,206
but completely fake app.


269
00:15:01,206 --> 00:15:05,796
Now we can look at how these two
things work together in action.


270
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:08,596
You can see that I'm
just tapping on a screen


271
00:15:08,596 --> 00:15:10,956
to make the notification
appear to open the app


272
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:12,326
and to go into the inbox.


273
00:15:13,116 --> 00:15:18,376
And on the Toaster, I can also
-- you can first of all you see


274
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,126
that the LED is already
blinking.


275
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,736
Then I can tap to
insert some bread.


276
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:25,726
I tap again to lower
our digital lever.


277
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:29,806
Then in a couple seconds later
the Toastie will pop back out,


278
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:32,076
and we're going to
see what's on it.


279
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:33,926
That is not too bad for now.


280
00:15:33,926 --> 00:15:37,546
We can immediately take this
and show it to our friends


281
00:15:37,656 --> 00:15:40,676
and ask them how they feel
about this so we can learn


282
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:43,616
from what they have to say.


283
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:46,776
So what is working right now?


284
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:49,726
Well, the LED seems to
be really good indicator


285
00:15:49,726 --> 00:15:52,546
that there is a new
Toastie, and the notification


286
00:15:52,546 --> 00:15:55,716
on the app helps us know that
there is a new Toastie even


287
00:15:55,716 --> 00:15:57,266
when we are not sitting
in the kitchen


288
00:15:57,816 --> 00:16:00,046
in full anticipation
looking at our Toaster.


289
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:04,476
What is not working so well
is, a lot of people mentioned


290
00:16:04,476 --> 00:16:07,786
to us what happens when you
have more than one Toastie?


291
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:11,236
That's true, our design doesn't
account for that very well.


292
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:15,986
So what can we do about this?


293
00:16:16,996 --> 00:16:21,096
Well, maybe we'll actually
upgrade the LED on our Toaster


294
00:16:21,376 --> 00:16:23,346
and maybe our app
can show a list


295
00:16:23,346 --> 00:16:25,056
of Toasties instead
of just the last one.


296
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:30,036
So let's take it from
the top here again.


297
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,246
Let's look again at our
hardware and at our app.


298
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:36,546
And at this stage again let's
ask ourselves what needs


299
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:37,316
to be more real now.


300
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:42,186
Well, we want our hardware
to handle multiple Toasties


301
00:16:42,276 --> 00:16:43,486
and toast the right one.


302
00:16:43,656 --> 00:16:46,416
On the app we want to be
able to browse Toasties


303
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:47,726
and select the right one for us.


304
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:49,476
What can we fake?


305
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:52,496
Still we are going to
fake as much as possible.


306
00:16:52,496 --> 00:16:54,226
There is not going to
be a real connection


307
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:55,426
between the two devices.


308
00:16:55,846 --> 00:16:58,756
Anything related to actual
toasting we are not even going


309
00:16:58,756 --> 00:16:59,866
to touch that.


310
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:03,406
For the app sending data back
and forth, again we are going


311
00:17:03,406 --> 00:17:06,316
to fake that and our UI
is mostly still pictures


312
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:07,406
and animations.


313
00:17:08,856 --> 00:17:10,096
Where will the products be used?


314
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:11,336
Still the same as before.


315
00:17:11,576 --> 00:17:14,826
The Toaster in the kitchen
and the app really anywhere.


316
00:17:16,376 --> 00:17:17,665
Let's look at our Toaster again.


317
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:22,146
We said we wanted to change
something about the LED.


318
00:17:22,146 --> 00:17:24,876
So maybe we can use a dot
matrix display here instead.


319
00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:28,516
We could indicate how many
Toasties have been received.


320
00:17:29,436 --> 00:17:33,086
And instead of using hi res
touch screen that we put


321
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:36,616
on the Toaster here which would
make our product complicated


322
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:39,106
to produce and expensive
to buy, we are not going


323
00:17:39,106 --> 00:17:41,646
to recreate capabilities that
we have on the phone anyway.


324
00:17:42,116 --> 00:17:44,676
We'll keep the hardware
simple and focus


325
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:46,666
on the complicated
stuff on the phone.


326
00:17:47,236 --> 00:17:51,826
So we'll add additional
Toasties to our inbox.


327
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:54,376
Easy to swipe through
so we can select


328
00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:55,756
which one we want to Toast.


329
00:17:56,096 --> 00:17:59,076
We will create a state where
a different Toastie has


330
00:17:59,076 --> 00:17:59,666
been selected.


331
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:04,296
We will also add a screen
that shows up on the app


332
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:05,936
when the Toaster is toasting.


333
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:07,776
We can add a count
down to the top


334
00:18:08,096 --> 00:18:09,556
so we know how long it will be


335
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:12,236
until we enjoy our
delicious piece of toast.


336
00:18:12,936 --> 00:18:17,786
Finally the Toastie is toasted
and it's back on the list


337
00:18:17,786 --> 00:18:19,726
and we can see what's
on our app as well.


338
00:18:23,086 --> 00:18:30,616
Now we have an iPhone, now we
have an iPhone running a keynote


339
00:18:30,616 --> 00:18:34,216
of a fake app and we have
an iPad running a keynote


340
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:35,006
of a fake Toaster.


341
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:39,606
With those two together we can
start playing more realistic


342
00:18:39,606 --> 00:18:41,526
scenario of our product
experience.


343
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:44,726
A notification comes in on
both devices at the same time.


344
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:46,316
We open the app.


345
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:48,986
We go to our inbox and
select a different Toastie.


346
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,446
We add some bread
to the Toaster,


347
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:53,656
push down the digital lever


348
00:18:53,656 --> 00:18:58,396
and eventually the Toastie
pops back out on both devices.


349
00:18:59,486 --> 00:19:00,336
Now, that's pretty cool.


350
00:19:00,336 --> 00:19:04,076
But there is a fundamental
problem with this unfortunately.


351
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:08,836
When we test our product, we
can't just put the devices next


352
00:19:08,836 --> 00:19:12,446
to each other in front of us
and happily tap on both of them


353
00:19:12,446 --> 00:19:15,616
in a really orchestrated way
to play this perfect scenario.


354
00:19:16,726 --> 00:19:19,946
What is more realistic is that
eventually the Toaster is going


355
00:19:19,946 --> 00:19:22,476
to be in the kitchen and
the app is going to be all


356
00:19:22,476 --> 00:19:23,596
over the place with you.


357
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,916
That's a fundamental part
of the experience, right?


358
00:19:27,216 --> 00:19:28,636
You get a notification.


359
00:19:28,886 --> 00:19:30,046
You walk up to the Toaster.


360
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:31,216
You do a couple things.


361
00:19:31,216 --> 00:19:33,336
It starts Toasting
and you walk away


362
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:36,286
to brush your teeth,
something like that.


363
00:19:36,286 --> 00:19:37,956
Eventually the Toastie is done


364
00:19:38,116 --> 00:19:39,456
and you come back
to the Toaster.


365
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:41,896
If you don't capture that
part of the experience,


366
00:19:42,246 --> 00:19:44,986
you're testing for something
that is entirely unrealistic.


367
00:19:46,106 --> 00:19:49,536
How can we make our
two Prototypes talk


368
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:51,666
to each other over a distance.


369
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:53,836
Ideally how can we do


370
00:19:53,836 --> 00:19:56,566
that without putting any
additional effort into it.


371
00:19:56,566 --> 00:20:01,276
I want to keep using the keynote
prototypes we just built.


372
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:04,546
It turns out our team has a
really convenient technique


373
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:06,056
for circumstances like that.


374
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:07,976
I want to show that
to you right now.


375
00:20:11,216 --> 00:20:14,806
You can see this is still our
keynote prototype on the phone.


376
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:19,736
But now the notification
actually comes in on its own.


377
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:23,496
We can still tap to
open the app and then go


378
00:20:23,496 --> 00:20:25,896
and select the different
Toastie that we want to Toast.


379
00:20:26,246 --> 00:20:30,546
And on the Toaster, you can see


380
00:20:30,546 --> 00:20:32,936
that we can still tap
to insert some bread.


381
00:20:33,476 --> 00:20:35,966
Now look at the app, what
happens when we lower the lever.


382
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:38,836
The app responds
to it in realtime.


383
00:20:40,236 --> 00:20:43,816
When the Toastie is
back finished Toasting,


384
00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:47,746
it appears on both
devices at the same time.


385
00:20:48,936 --> 00:20:50,326
That's pretty awesome, I think.


386
00:20:51,396 --> 00:20:52,676
But how do we do that?


387
00:20:53,576 --> 00:20:56,926
Especially considering that
this is really just images


388
00:20:56,926 --> 00:21:02,056
on devices, and we didn't
write a single line of code.


389
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,946
Well, it turns out
we have something


390
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:06,426
that is a little bit cooler
and a little bit faster


391
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:08,096
and a little bit
smarter than code.


392

393

We call this ...

[ Applause ]


395
00:21:22,256 --> 00:21:24,216
>> MATTHAEUS KRENN: We call this
technique behind the curtain.


396
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:27,656
It is essentially about a person
pretending to be a computer.


397
00:21:29,176 --> 00:21:31,826
In our case, it's
me behind the sofa,


398
00:21:31,826 --> 00:21:37,106
using two keynote remotes
connected to the iPhone and iPad


399
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:41,276
and I can supplement
tapping on the Prototypes


400
00:21:41,536 --> 00:21:44,256
by remotely controlling
the state of each device.


401
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:48,286
When you do something on the
app I can press on the remote


402
00:21:48,286 --> 00:21:50,596
and the Toaster reacts to it.


403
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:53,956
We create a perfect simulation
of this realistic experience


404
00:21:53,956 --> 00:21:56,726
and we didn't really have to
do anything to achieve it.


405
00:21:57,256 --> 00:21:59,596
You wouldn't believe
actually how many people


406
00:21:59,596 --> 00:22:00,826
at Apple we tricked


407
00:22:00,826 --> 00:22:03,636
into thinking we have
implemented some magical


408
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:07,566
technology where really, as
we were demoing our Prototype,


409
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:10,006
some of our team is
just kind of sitting


410
00:22:10,006 --> 00:22:12,486
in the corner controlling
one of the Prototypes.


411
00:22:13,186 --> 00:22:17,526
And so again with this more
realistic setup we can go


412
00:22:17,526 --> 00:22:19,496
to our friends and
ask them for feedback.


413
00:22:26,256 --> 00:22:27,566
And we ask them what's working.


414
00:22:28,326 --> 00:22:31,406
Well, selecting from
many Toasties


415
00:22:31,636 --> 00:22:33,986
and then Toasting the right
one, it's all done, all good.


416
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:36,516
What is not working?


417
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:40,036
Well, despite our incredible
Prototyping efforts,


418
00:22:40,656 --> 00:22:43,476
the devices still don't feel
really connected and responsive.


419
00:22:44,616 --> 00:22:45,646
What can we do about that?


420
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:50,876
Maybe we can have the Toaster
react in realtime to the input


421
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:52,446
in the app and vice versa.


422
00:22:53,576 --> 00:22:54,886
To do that we are
going to have to step


423
00:22:54,886 --> 00:22:56,766
up our Prototyping
game a little bit.


424
00:22:56,966 --> 00:22:58,686
I'm going to ask
Bill on the stage


425
00:22:58,856 --> 00:23:00,666
to show you guys how to do that.


426
00:23:01,516 --> 00:23:03,916
[ Applause ]


427
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,556
>> BILL: Thank you,
Matthaeus, that's awesome.


428
00:23:07,946 --> 00:23:09,476
Hello, everybody, I'm Bill.


429
00:23:10,346 --> 00:23:13,166
I get to spend my
days experimenting


430
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:16,376
with top-secret Apple hardware
which is pretty awesome.


431
00:23:18,256 --> 00:23:20,776
So we would like to share a
little bit about our process


432
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:23,656
that might give you
some ideas for designing


433
00:23:23,656 --> 00:23:26,626
for your own top-secret
hardware or possibly a device


434
00:23:26,626 --> 00:23:27,976
that you just don't have yet.


435
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,376
So after a couple of iterations,
we are feeling pretty good


436
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:40,326
about the designs that
Matthaeus created for us.


437
00:23:41,076 --> 00:23:43,006
However, with the
keynote prototypes,


438
00:23:43,536 --> 00:23:44,936
it can only take us so far.


439
00:23:45,236 --> 00:23:48,326
We can tap through from
state to state or fake that,


440
00:23:48,896 --> 00:23:50,576
but there is no true
interactivity yet.


441
00:23:51,226 --> 00:23:53,216
For example, the digital lever.


442
00:23:53,706 --> 00:23:56,256
We can't drag that up and
down, which is pretty critical.


443
00:24:03,046 --> 00:24:06,856
So let's return to
our three questions


444
00:24:07,466 --> 00:24:10,726
and decide how can we enhance
the fidelity of these prototypes


445
00:24:11,086 --> 00:24:13,306
with a little bit of
interactivity and a little bit


446
00:24:13,306 --> 00:24:15,826
of connectivity to make
them that much better.


447
00:24:16,386 --> 00:24:19,576
What needs to be more real?


448
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:24,016
On the hardware side we want
to wire up the digital lever.


449
00:24:25,296 --> 00:24:26,696
We also want to connect
the state


450
00:24:26,696 --> 00:24:29,206
of the Toaster to
the app itself.


451
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:33,146
On the app side let's
allow our friends


452
00:24:33,146 --> 00:24:35,966
to browse the Toasties
in the inbox.


453
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:39,946
Also pick a Toastie to Toast.


454
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:43,186
So we like faking things.


455
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:44,906
What can we keep fake?


456
00:24:45,576 --> 00:24:48,856
Let's not worry about
servers, edge cases,


457
00:24:49,246 --> 00:24:50,506
turning bread into Toast.


458
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:54,206
And on the app side,
we are going to keep


459
00:24:54,206 --> 00:24:56,126
that message queue
completely canned


460
00:24:56,426 --> 00:24:58,496
and also the Toasties
themselves,


461
00:24:58,966 --> 00:25:01,246
we'll have them be
images on both devices.


462
00:25:01,246 --> 00:25:03,016
We won't actually send
them back and forth


463
00:25:03,116 --> 00:25:08,696
between the devices
over the air.


464
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:11,606
Okay. So where are we
going to use these things?


465
00:25:11,606 --> 00:25:12,686
Toasters live in the kitchen,


466
00:25:12,686 --> 00:25:14,426
so we'll use the
Toaster in the kitchen.


467
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:17,026
The app can be used anywhere


468
00:25:17,026 --> 00:25:18,406
that maybe you're
hungry for a snack.


469
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:21,456
Maybe it's the first app you
launch when you roll out of bed.


470
00:25:22,016 --> 00:25:25,906
We have to ask ourselves,


471
00:25:25,956 --> 00:25:27,706
what is the best way
of moving forward?


472
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:34,186
Matthaeus said he wanted to
connect the Toaster and the app.


473
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,906
Maybe we start with a real
Toaster, hack it together


474
00:25:37,906 --> 00:25:39,466
with a microcontroller.


475
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:43,526
Maybe put a wireless radio
on it, some LEDs to make


476
00:25:43,526 --> 00:25:45,166
that a nice little display.


477
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:47,106
And this would probably work.


478
00:25:47,106 --> 00:25:51,666
But we are not committed enough
to this design to move forward


479
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:54,156
in this direction because this
is starting to feel very real.


480
00:25:54,156 --> 00:25:59,906
Maybe it's time to 3D print
a model of our Toaster


481
00:26:00,516 --> 00:26:03,816
and start customizing
Toasties with a laser cutter.


482
00:26:04,406 --> 00:26:08,416
Let's be honest, we are
always looking for excuses


483
00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:10,376
to use the 3D printer
and the laser cutter.

in front of the horse a bit.


488
00:26:23,546 --> 00:26:27,976

490
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,806
>> BILL LINDMEIER: This will
be extremely awesome and fun


491
00:26:43,806 --> 00:26:46,526
to use, but Toaster haptics
are still about five years out,


492
00:26:46,526 --> 00:26:49,916
so we have to put it on hold.


493
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:53,476
Seriously, all three
examples have in common


494
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:56,766
that they are distracting
us from the task at hand


495
00:26:57,096 --> 00:26:58,666
which is designing
the experience.


496
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:04,316
So to the extent that we do
any engineering at this point,


497
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:08,036
let's keep it to the engineering
which enhances our design


498
00:27:08,036 --> 00:27:10,126
and lets us explore that
a little bit further.


499
00:27:11,346 --> 00:27:13,916
That way when we actually do
go to make this thing we know


500
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:17,036
that we are making
the right thing.


501
00:27:17,246 --> 00:27:20,416
Okay. So with that in
mind, for the purposes


502
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:22,916
of our Prototype,
what is a Toaster?


503
00:27:24,096 --> 00:27:26,886
It is not a bread heating
device, but you knew that.


504
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:29,766
It is a connected state machine.


505
00:27:30,456 --> 00:27:33,166
When I say that I just mean
that it's a physical object


506
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:36,076
with attributes like where
the digital lever is, whether


507
00:27:36,076 --> 00:27:38,856
or not there's Toast in it,
what message is toasting,


508
00:27:39,296 --> 00:27:41,936
and we want to know how do
these attributes respond


509
00:27:42,116 --> 00:27:42,936
to user input.


510
00:27:44,146 --> 00:27:47,606
We can easily model
this with software.


511
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:53,906
So we are going to take our
existing keynote Prototypes,


512
00:27:54,656 --> 00:27:55,746
the app of the Toaster.


513
00:27:55,936 --> 00:27:57,896
We are going to port
them to Swift.


514
00:27:58,566 --> 00:28:02,496
And when I say we are going to
port them to Swift, I don't mean


515
00:28:02,496 --> 00:28:04,026
that we are going to
make a fully functional,


516
00:28:04,026 --> 00:28:05,436
feature-rich Swift app.


517
00:28:06,696 --> 00:28:09,746
It is a lot like the Prototypes
in that there are screen shots


518
00:28:10,126 --> 00:28:13,616
and they animate based on user
touches, but then we are going


519
00:28:13,616 --> 00:28:16,126
to sprinkle in just a
little bit of extra code


520
00:28:16,126 --> 00:28:18,416
for features we want
to explore further.


521
00:28:19,826 --> 00:28:21,446
Of course this doesn't
have to be Swift.


522
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:23,796
It can be another
programming language you like.


523
00:28:24,086 --> 00:28:26,576
It can be another tool that
allows you more interactivity.


524
00:28:27,046 --> 00:28:29,686
But we at Apple happen to
like Swift so we are going


525
00:28:29,686 --> 00:28:32,906
to move forward with that.


526
00:28:33,116 --> 00:28:36,086
Okay. So specifically let's
define what we are going


527
00:28:36,086 --> 00:28:36,596
to implement.


528
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,546
The Toast-a-Toastie flow.


529
00:28:39,126 --> 00:28:44,396
So for the first step we want to
pick a Toastie from the inbox.


530
00:28:45,816 --> 00:28:51,096
Next we want to send the
Toastie to the Toaster.


531
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:57,096
Third, we want to Toast the
selected Toastie and finally,


532
00:28:57,096 --> 00:28:59,206
we want to indicate that
the Toastie is Toasted.


533
00:28:59,826 --> 00:29:05,146
So here is our new
interactive app prototype.


534
00:29:05,146 --> 00:29:09,426
What we've done is turned this
carousel into a UI scroll view


535
00:29:09,426 --> 00:29:11,746
that allows our friends
to easily paginate


536
00:29:11,746 --> 00:29:12,926
between the different messages.


537
00:29:13,496 --> 00:29:18,496
We have a UI slider at
the bottom which allows us


538
00:29:18,496 --> 00:29:19,896
to pick the color of the Toast.


539
00:29:20,766 --> 00:29:23,846
We've also added a gesture
recognizer to each slice


540
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:26,936
of Toast so we can pull it
down into the virtual Toaster


541
00:29:27,206 --> 00:29:28,686
and simulate that
it's being sent.


542
00:29:29,326 --> 00:29:34,336
Let's see how that
looks in action.


543
00:29:34,526 --> 00:29:35,566
We launch our inbox.


544
00:29:36,586 --> 00:29:40,116
You can see as we swipe through
the Toastie selected increases.


545
00:29:40,726 --> 00:29:44,106
And we can adjust the
Toast darkness variable.


546
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,596
And then we are going
to drag the Toast


547
00:29:49,596 --> 00:29:53,726
down into the virtual Toaster
which sets Toasting to true,


548
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:56,976
kicks off an animation and
our Toastie is presented.


549
00:30:06,046 --> 00:30:06,276
All right.


550
00:30:06,706 --> 00:30:07,746
Moving on to the Toaster.


551
00:30:07,746 --> 00:30:11,506
We are going to add a gesture
recognizer to the digital lever.


552
00:30:12,526 --> 00:30:14,866
When you pull it all the way
down, it begins Toasting,


553
00:30:14,936 --> 00:30:17,166
set Toasting to true,
begin a timer.


554
00:30:17,286 --> 00:30:20,266
We have also added a
segmented control at the bottom


555
00:30:20,346 --> 00:30:23,006
that lets us easily pick
the message we want to Toast


556
00:30:23,006 --> 00:30:24,156
without connecting
it to the app,


557
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,466
and finally the animation
will present the Toast.


558
00:30:27,866 --> 00:30:29,406
Let's take a look at that.


559
00:30:30,736 --> 00:30:33,066
We are selecting our Toast
which loads the bread.


560
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:36,366
You can see we have this nice
animation now in the LED matrix.


561
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:40,326
When we bring the lever
all the way down to 1,


562
00:30:40,326 --> 00:30:44,196
it is Toasting set to
true, kicks off the timer.


563
00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:45,896
And our Toast is presented.


564
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:51,046
So this is a critical stage.


565
00:30:52,086 --> 00:30:54,596
This technique of
modeling hardware


566
00:30:54,596 --> 00:30:56,696
with software is super
useful and we use it


567
00:30:56,696 --> 00:30:57,886
in our studio all the time.


568
00:30:58,826 --> 00:31:01,546
You can imagine that you are
making a connected Fireplace


569
00:31:01,806 --> 00:31:03,476
and you want to integrate
that with HomeKit.


570
00:31:04,776 --> 00:31:08,046
You can use a projector or that
large screen TV that you've got.


571
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,946
Put it where you expect the
Fireplace to be in the den


572
00:31:10,946 --> 00:31:13,236
and you can simulate
the controls right


573
00:31:13,236 --> 00:31:14,416
where they are going to be used.


574
00:31:15,856 --> 00:31:18,536
Maybe you are creating the next
great Transit app for the Watch


575
00:31:18,536 --> 00:31:20,076
but you don't have a Watch yet.


576
00:31:20,516 --> 00:31:23,076
Throw the interface on
an iPod, bring the iPod


577
00:31:23,076 --> 00:31:26,146
down into the subway station
and use it in context.


578
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:30,446
Maybe you're making
the next great drone.


579
00:31:31,316 --> 00:31:33,856
You can simulate the hardware
controls on an iPhone,


580
00:31:34,106 --> 00:31:35,616
strap it to the paper prototype,


581
00:31:35,616 --> 00:31:39,156
and when you're moving it
around, you can stream gyroscope


582
00:31:39,156 --> 00:31:42,476
and accelerometer data back
as if it's the real hardware.


583
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:49,566
So we've got the interactive
app, the interactive Toaster.


584
00:31:49,716 --> 00:31:52,226
Now we need to send data across.


585
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:56,346
Pick the Toastie from the
app and send physical states


586
00:31:56,346 --> 00:32:00,706
across from the Toaster
back to the app.


587
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:02,386
What is the best way to do this?


588
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:06,576
The best way is whatever is
easiest and fastest for you.


589
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:09,526
We are not designing
a network API.


590
00:32:09,526 --> 00:32:11,856
We can let somebody
else do that later.


591
00:32:11,856 --> 00:32:13,666
We are not worried
about efficiency.


592
00:32:14,216 --> 00:32:16,516
If you're Prototyping
in the browser,


593
00:32:17,016 --> 00:32:18,396
maybe you use Web sockets.


594
00:32:18,976 --> 00:32:22,566
If you've got that drone and
the phone connected to it,


595
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,436
you can stream the
gyroscope data


596
00:32:24,436 --> 00:32:28,386
with O.S.C. Maybe you
have a back end server


597
00:32:28,686 --> 00:32:32,846
and you can use HTTP requests.


598
00:32:32,876 --> 00:32:34,896
I know that some of you have
probably never programmed a


599
00:32:34,896 --> 00:32:35,896
networking layer before.


600
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:37,766
So think creatively.


601
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:41,596
You can use a service like if
this then that to observe emails


602
00:32:41,596 --> 00:32:43,846
that you're sending back and
forth between the devices


603
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:45,016
and take action upon that.


604
00:32:45,726 --> 00:32:48,216
Maybe you're noticing
whenever a new photo is added


605
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,726
to a shared photo stream.


606
00:32:53,046 --> 00:32:56,566
So we are going to use a
Multipeer connectivity peer


607
00:32:56,566 --> 00:32:57,476
to peer connection.


608
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,686
This is what our network
is going to look like.


609
00:33:00,316 --> 00:33:02,646
We have two iPhones
connected to an iPad


610
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:04,566
and call our network Toast Talk.


611
00:33:05,236 --> 00:33:07,646
The reason we're using
Multipeer connectivity,


612
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:09,586
it is incredibly easy to set up.


613
00:33:09,936 --> 00:33:15,316
It doesn't require a server and
it allows an arbitrary number


614
00:33:15,316 --> 00:33:16,356
of devices to connect.


615
00:33:16,816 --> 00:33:19,096
So here is a bit of code.


616
00:33:19,096 --> 00:33:21,976
I'm going to fly right through
because we are running short


617
00:33:21,976 --> 00:33:22,516
on time.


618
00:33:22,516 --> 00:33:24,316
We are going to create
a session.


619
00:33:24,316 --> 00:33:28,726
We are going to name the network
Toast Talk and take any data


620
00:33:28,726 --> 00:33:30,806
that comes in and
convert it to a string.


621
00:33:31,356 --> 00:33:35,796
We can choose devices with
this handy class called the MC


622
00:33:35,796 --> 00:33:37,026
Browser View Controller.


623
00:33:37,026 --> 00:33:40,096
Super easy to set up.


624
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,846
You pass the name
into the constructtor


625
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:45,276
and also pass in that session.


626
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:49,316
You can present it on a button
click or when the app launches.


627
00:33:49,796 --> 00:33:53,816
Then you just dismiss it
when they've connected.


628
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,646
What messages should
we send back and forth?


629
00:33:56,396 --> 00:33:59,776
The app Prototype wants to tell
the Toaster the Toasty number


630
00:34:00,276 --> 00:34:01,786
and the Toast darkness.


631
00:34:02,336 --> 00:34:05,786
The Toaster needs to
send the lever position


632
00:34:06,016 --> 00:34:09,246
when Toasting began and
when Toasting ended.


633
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:13,545
A little bit of code
that does that.


634
00:34:13,795 --> 00:34:16,106
We are just going to
convert our string to data


635
00:34:16,106 --> 00:34:17,396
and send that to the session.


636
00:34:18,636 --> 00:34:21,315
And this is an example of how we
might send the letter position.


637
00:34:21,315 --> 00:34:23,676
We are going to say
we've got our message


638
00:34:23,735 --> 00:34:24,866
which is lever position.


639
00:34:25,005 --> 00:34:27,606
Throw a carat in there and
pass some data along with it.


640
00:34:27,606 --> 00:34:31,376
This is a totally arbitrary
format but fast and simple.


641
00:34:32,315 --> 00:34:34,856
We will split the incoming
messages on that carat


642
00:34:35,326 --> 00:34:38,985
and switch overall the message
names and pass the data off


643
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,436
to whatever function
is appropriate.


644
00:34:41,815 --> 00:34:45,096
This allows us this really
cool dynamic relationship


645
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:46,556
between our Toaster and our app.


646
00:34:47,356 --> 00:34:49,866
You can see as I drag the
digital lever up and down,


647
00:34:50,426 --> 00:34:54,045
that's reflected in the app.


648
00:34:54,306 --> 00:34:55,085
That's pretty great.


649
00:34:55,085 --> 00:34:56,085
We've closed the loop.


650
00:34:56,525 --> 00:34:58,456
We have interactive
apps and Toasters.


651
00:34:59,636 --> 00:35:00,436
The world is good.


652
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:03,946
Let's give this to our friends,
let them try it in context


653
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:05,746
and see what they think.


654
00:35:06,516 --> 00:35:29,136
[ Music and Applause ]


655
00:35:29,636 --> 00:35:32,116
>> BILL LINDMEIER: So
Toastal Service is shaping up


656
00:35:33,726 --> 00:35:36,076
and starting to feel
real and we haven't done


657
00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:36,946
that much engineering.


658
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:39,766
Let's learn from the feedback.


659
00:35:40,646 --> 00:35:41,376
What is working?


660
00:35:41,376 --> 00:35:43,806
Clearly we can pick
messages from the inbox


661
00:35:43,806 --> 00:35:45,236
and send them to the Toaster.


662
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,506
That's a fundamental
part of this experience.


663
00:35:48,886 --> 00:35:49,766
What is not working?


664
00:35:49,766 --> 00:35:52,496
Our friends told us
it's a little odd


665
00:35:52,496 --> 00:35:54,386
that there's no visual
feedback from the Toaster


666
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:57,556
when you select the color
from the color slider.


667
00:35:58,206 --> 00:35:59,366
Maybe in the next round


668
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:04,896
of Prototyping iteration we
adjust the color of the LEDs


669
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:08,056
on that matrix to reflect that
the data is being sent over


670
00:36:08,436 --> 00:36:11,646
and the color is
being remembered.


671
00:36:12,256 --> 00:36:16,176
So with that, I would like to
invite Jeff back up to the stage


672
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:17,416
and he can wrap it up for us.


673
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:17,906

>> JEFFREY TRAER
BERNSTEIN: Thank you, Bill.


676
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:25,916
Thanks for taking so much time


677
00:36:26,006 --> 00:36:28,416
on that last sentence,
all right.


678
00:36:28,496 --> 00:36:30,166
Quick recap for everybody.


679
00:36:30,776 --> 00:36:33,046
We Prototyped using
pictures and animation


680
00:36:33,466 --> 00:36:35,526
so we could quickly
see different inputs


681
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,656
and outputs for the Toaster.


682
00:36:37,176 --> 00:36:39,096
We showed you the behind
the curtain technique


683
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:42,326
to see how the app and
the device work together.


684
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:45,416
Then we created a
lightweight interactive


685
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:46,466
and connective Prototype


686
00:36:47,186 --> 00:36:49,746
so we could try the entire
end-to-end experience.


687
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,416
Along the way we learned a
few things about our Toaster.


688
00:36:54,626 --> 00:36:56,456
We don't need a darkness
setting on the Toaster


689
00:36:56,456 --> 00:36:57,916
where most Toasters have that.


690
00:36:59,036 --> 00:37:00,896
We need a number
display on the Toaster.


691
00:37:01,616 --> 00:37:03,656
We need a sensor on
the digital lever


692
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:04,946
to communicate back to the app.


693
00:37:05,586 --> 00:37:08,786
We figured all of this
out really, really fast.


694
00:37:10,336 --> 00:37:11,906
Look at all the time
and money we saved.


695
00:37:12,136 --> 00:37:14,946
Imagine that we had to build
a real Toaster to learn all


696
00:37:14,946 --> 00:37:18,846
of these things and we got
really cool ideas along the way.


697
00:37:19,816 --> 00:37:21,246
So all of that reminds me:


698
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,736
There are two important
reasons to Prototype.


699
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:26,876
Number one is to test
ideas to save time


700
00:37:26,876 --> 00:37:29,016
and money building the
right things for your app.


701
00:37:30,256 --> 00:37:32,506
Number two is to get new
ideas to make the experience


702
00:37:32,506 --> 00:37:33,646
of your product even better.


703
00:37:34,246 --> 00:37:35,276
How do we do it?


704
00:37:35,476 --> 00:37:36,416
We make fake things.


705
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:39,386
We show people and learn
from their feedback.


706
00:37:39,896 --> 00:37:44,506
And we do it over and over again
until our product is incredible.


707
00:37:46,546 --> 00:37:48,736
So here is what we would like
you to go and do after this.


708
00:37:49,776 --> 00:37:51,826
If you are creating a
thing connected to an app,


709
00:37:51,976 --> 00:37:53,906
for the thing, fake
it on a screen.


710
00:37:54,626 --> 00:37:55,316
In context.


711
00:37:56,046 --> 00:37:59,616
For your app, fake it
with pictures in context


712
00:38:00,106 --> 00:38:03,636
and for the connection between
the two, just tap through both.


713
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:07,116
Or use the behind the curtain
technique or behind the sofa.


714
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:11,196
And maybe create a
lightweight network prototype.


715
00:38:12,096 --> 00:38:13,716
If you just don't
have the device,


716
00:38:14,556 --> 00:38:16,066
especially perhaps
the next thing


717
00:38:16,066 --> 00:38:18,956
that we unveil, don't wait.


718
00:38:19,236 --> 00:38:21,236
Fake it on a screen, in context.


719
00:38:21,236 --> 00:38:24,456
Here is some stuff
about more information.


720
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:26,666
There are related sessions.


721
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:31,336
Most importantly, tomorrow
Designing with Animation.


722
00:38:31,806 --> 00:38:34,776
Some of our teammates at
3:30 in this very room.


723
00:38:35,216 --> 00:38:36,706
I think you'll find
it very useful.


724
00:38:36,956 --> 00:38:37,976
Thank you very much, everybody!
