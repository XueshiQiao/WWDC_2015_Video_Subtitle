00:00:24.516 --> 00:00:29.376 A:middle
[Cheering and applause]

00:00:29.876 --> 00:00:30.696 A:middle
&gt;&gt; BRITTANY PAINE: Hi, everyone.

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:33.166 A:middle
My name is Brittany Paine,

00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:35.966 A:middle
and later you will
meet Jon Drummond.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:38.386 A:middle
We are engineers on
the SpringBoard team.

00:00:38.736 --> 00:00:41.326 A:middle
Today we are going to talk to
you about optimizing your app

00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:44.066 A:middle
for multitasking
on iPad and iOS 9.

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:47.946 A:middle
This is actually the third talk

00:00:47.946 --> 00:00:51.466 A:middle
in the series related
to multitasking.

00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.916 A:middle
The first two already happened.

00:00:53.016 --> 00:00:54.816 A:middle
If you didn't get a
chance to watch them,

00:00:55.476 --> 00:00:56.256 A:middle
you should go watch them.

00:00:56.326 --> 00:01:00.076 A:middle
So I have a lot to say today.



00:00:56.326 --> 00:01:00.076 A:middle
So I have a lot to say today.

00:01:00.076 --> 00:01:00.746 A:middle
Jon does too.

00:01:00.746 --> 00:01:02.686 A:middle
We are going to go pretty fast.

00:01:02.746 --> 00:01:03.716 A:middle
Put on your listening ears.

00:01:05.576 --> 00:01:07.836 A:middle
So this is your app.

00:01:07.836 --> 00:01:13.326 A:middle
In iOS 8, your app had the
full device at your disposal.

00:01:13.386 --> 00:01:15.616 A:middle
It could use as much
system resources

00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:16.896 A:middle
as the device had available.

00:01:17.886 --> 00:01:21.626 A:middle
However, in multitasking in iOS
9 this is no longer the case.

00:01:22.476 --> 00:01:24.906 A:middle
There can and probably
will be more

00:01:24.906 --> 00:01:26.666 A:middle
than one app on screen
at a time.

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:29.246 A:middle
And all of the apps
on screen now have

00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:30.646 A:middle
to share the system resources.

00:01:31.156 --> 00:01:35.596 A:middle
Some system resources
like CPU, GPU,

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:38.126 A:middle
and disk I/O degrade gradually

00:01:38.126 --> 00:01:40.186 A:middle
as multiple processes
compete for them.

00:01:40.906 --> 00:01:42.876 A:middle
Let's look at an example of CPU.

00:01:44.406 --> 00:01:47.346 A:middle
So for the new developers in
the audience, the Holy Grail

00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:50.636 A:middle
of app responsiveness is to
be able to update your UI

00:01:50.856 --> 00:01:54.816 A:middle
at 60 frames per
second, or 60 FPS.

00:01:54.816 --> 00:01:57.836 A:middle
This means you have
about 16 milliseconds

00:01:57.876 --> 00:02:00.316 A:middle
to get all your work done
in response to a user event.



00:01:57.876 --> 00:02:00.316 A:middle
to get all your work done
in response to a user event.

00:02:00.316 --> 00:02:03.466 A:middle
So if this is your app,

00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:07.346 A:middle
let's say it is doing a great
job rendering at 60 FPS.

00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:10.675 A:middle
It can get all its work done
in only 10 milliseconds.

00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:14.086 A:middle
Each of these slices
represents one millisecond.

00:02:15.526 --> 00:02:18.046 A:middle
Then, the user brings
in a secondary app.

00:02:18.626 --> 00:02:22.046 A:middle
That app is also doing a
great job updating at 60 FPS.

00:02:22.046 --> 00:02:25.026 A:middle
And it gets all its work
finished in 6 milliseconds.

00:02:25.926 --> 00:02:29.676 A:middle
Both apps combined, as you
can see, are already using

00:02:29.676 --> 00:02:32.206 A:middle
up all 16 milliseconds
that we have in order

00:02:32.206 --> 00:02:33.476 A:middle
to be able to render at 60 FPS.

00:02:34.326 --> 00:02:37.496 A:middle
And then the user starts a PiP,

00:02:37.496 --> 00:02:39.796 A:middle
and the PiP is also
doing a great job,

00:02:40.096 --> 00:02:42.336 A:middle
and he needs eight
milliseconds to render his UI.

00:02:43.286 --> 00:02:45.606 A:middle
The combined total
of all three apps

00:02:45.606 --> 00:02:50.586 A:middle
on screen are 24
milliseconds, and that means

00:02:50.706 --> 00:02:53.616 A:middle
that the rendering is actually
at about 40 FIPS instead

00:02:53.616 --> 00:02:55.226 A:middle
of the 60 FIPS that we want.

00:02:55.776 --> 00:02:57.276 A:middle
The user will notice stuttering.

00:02:58.566 --> 00:03:00.616 A:middle
The same type of problem
applies to the GPU.



00:02:58.566 --> 00:03:00.616 A:middle
The same type of problem
applies to the GPU.

00:03:01.776 --> 00:03:06.036 A:middle
However, some system resources
like memory can result

00:03:06.036 --> 00:03:07.856 A:middle
in a much worse user experience

00:03:07.856 --> 00:03:09.736 A:middle
when multiple processes
are competing for them.

00:03:10.606 --> 00:03:11.876 A:middle
Look at the example again.

00:03:12.506 --> 00:03:13.976 A:middle
Here is the app again.

00:03:14.386 --> 00:03:17.106 A:middle
Below the iPad is the
system memory footprint.

00:03:17.106 --> 00:03:19.486 A:middle
You can see on the very left
we have the system using some

00:03:19.486 --> 00:03:20.146 A:middle
amount of memory.

00:03:20.146 --> 00:03:22.936 A:middle
In the middle, we have
your app, the blue app,

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:23.966 A:middle
using some amount of memory.

00:03:24.546 --> 00:03:26.466 A:middle
Then we have all
of this free space.

00:03:26.846 --> 00:03:29.216 A:middle
There is so much
room for activities.

00:03:29.466 --> 00:03:30.626 A:middle
You can do all kind of stuff.

00:03:31.396 --> 00:03:35.806 A:middle
And then, the user
brings in a secondary app,

00:03:35.806 --> 00:03:37.706 A:middle
and the secondary app
needs memory, too.

00:03:38.356 --> 00:03:39.606 A:middle
But we are still in good shape.

00:03:39.606 --> 00:03:41.856 A:middle
We have a tiny bit
of free memory left.

00:03:42.976 --> 00:03:45.566 A:middle
Then guess what happens next?

00:03:46.296 --> 00:03:47.396 A:middle
The PiP happens.

00:03:47.396 --> 00:03:49.196 A:middle
Now we are out of memory.

00:03:49.446 --> 00:03:51.686 A:middle
When the system can't
find free memory,

00:03:51.686 --> 00:03:52.876 A:middle
it has to kill a process.

00:03:53.596 --> 00:03:58.546 A:middle
In that instance, the user gets
ripped out of his or her --

00:03:58.736 --> 00:04:00.386 A:middle
we'll say her --
current context,



00:03:58.736 --> 00:04:00.386 A:middle
we'll say her --
current context,

00:04:00.936 --> 00:04:03.196 A:middle
and we are taken
back to SpringBoard.

00:04:03.546 --> 00:04:06.686 A:middle
In my opinion, that is a
much worse user experience

00:04:07.086 --> 00:04:09.696 A:middle
than just the stuttering
UI that can happen

00:04:09.696 --> 00:04:12.356 A:middle
when multiple processes
compete for CPU or GPU.

00:04:12.356 --> 00:04:17.846 A:middle
So now you may be asking
yourself, what is SpringBoard,

00:04:18.156 --> 00:04:21.245 A:middle
and why are SpringBoard
engineers here today to talk

00:04:21.245 --> 00:04:22.376 A:middle
to you about multitasking?

00:04:23.026 --> 00:04:25.336 A:middle
Well, SpringBoard
is a lot of things.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:27.796 A:middle
It is the Home screen.

00:04:28.176 --> 00:04:29.076 A:middle
The Lock screen.

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:34.206 A:middle
Icons, wallpaper, system
gestures, notification center.

00:04:34.786 --> 00:04:35.526 A:middle
Control center.

00:04:36.386 --> 00:04:38.566 A:middle
I got lost.

00:04:38.816 --> 00:04:42.126 A:middle
Okay, all of these
things and more.

00:04:43.046 --> 00:04:48.916 A:middle
But most importantly, we are a
UI application just like y'all.

00:04:49.206 --> 00:04:53.556 A:middle
SpringBoard is also the
original multitasking app.

00:04:53.616 --> 00:04:57.726 A:middle
Prior to iOS 9 and
also in iOS 9,

00:04:57.806 --> 00:05:00.646 A:middle
SpringBoard is always considered
to be running in the foreground,



00:04:57.806 --> 00:05:00.646 A:middle
SpringBoard is always considered
to be running in the foreground,

00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:02.576 A:middle
even though your app
is visible to the user.

00:05:02.576 --> 00:05:06.866 A:middle
Because of that, we
face the same challenges

00:05:06.866 --> 00:05:09.436 A:middle
that y'all do today in the
new multitasking environment.

00:05:09.966 --> 00:05:13.516 A:middle
And we've learned a lot
of lessons along the way.

00:05:14.086 --> 00:05:16.676 A:middle
And we would like to share
some of those lessons

00:05:16.676 --> 00:05:18.896 A:middle
with y'all today so you
don't make the same mistakes.

00:05:19.406 --> 00:05:21.526 A:middle
Let's get started.

00:05:21.916 --> 00:05:26.436 A:middle
Optimizing your app, the
easy stuff, part one.

00:05:26.636 --> 00:05:30.346 A:middle
First thing, use the
Leaks instrument and find

00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:31.256 A:middle
and fix your memory leaks.

00:05:33.316 --> 00:05:34.956 A:middle
How many of you have
forgotten to write DIALEK?

00:05:34.956 --> 00:05:37.936 A:middle
There has to be more
hands than that.

00:05:37.936 --> 00:05:39.686 A:middle
Well, I have.

00:05:39.686 --> 00:05:43.046 A:middle
Happens to the best of us.

00:05:43.046 --> 00:05:45.786 A:middle
And the Leaks instrument can
help you find those problems,

00:05:45.786 --> 00:05:47.206 A:middle
and they are usually
really easy to fix.

00:05:48.986 --> 00:05:52.076 A:middle
However, the best way to
avoid leaks is to use Swift.

00:05:52.416 --> 00:05:53.506 A:middle
You should do that instead.

00:05:55.666 --> 00:05:58.896 A:middle
Next, you should use the
Allocations instrument to find

00:05:58.896 --> 00:06:01.646 A:middle
and fix retained cycles and
unbounded memory growth.



00:05:58.896 --> 00:06:01.646 A:middle
and fix retained cycles and
unbounded memory growth.

00:06:02.736 --> 00:06:06.276 A:middle
Last, you should use the Time
Profiler instrument to find

00:06:06.276 --> 00:06:07.466 A:middle
and fix inefficient algorithms.

00:06:08.816 --> 00:06:11.526 A:middle
I'm not going to talk about
any of these problems today.

00:06:11.526 --> 00:06:14.946 A:middle
These types of problems apply
to all apps, not just apps

00:06:15.136 --> 00:06:16.586 A:middle
that are interested
in multitasking.

00:06:17.866 --> 00:06:20.586 A:middle
Instead, we are going to focus
on the things most important

00:06:20.586 --> 00:06:22.056 A:middle
in the new multitasking
environment.

00:06:22.756 --> 00:06:26.966 A:middle
In our experience, the
biggest lesson we learned is

00:06:26.966 --> 00:06:30.016 A:middle
that great performance
involves trade-offs.

00:06:30.086 --> 00:06:32.936 A:middle
Are you going to precompute
your data and keep it in memory?

00:06:33.466 --> 00:06:36.266 A:middle
Or are you going to calculate
it on the fly and use CPU?

00:06:37.276 --> 00:06:40.156 A:middle
Are you going to keep all your
resources locally on disk?

00:06:40.836 --> 00:06:42.516 A:middle
Or are you going to
keep them in the cloud

00:06:42.516 --> 00:06:43.716 A:middle
and fetch them whenever
you need them?

00:06:44.626 --> 00:06:46.056 A:middle
Are you going to
run your animations

00:06:46.056 --> 00:06:48.546 A:middle
on the CPU or on the GPU?

00:06:48.546 --> 00:06:51.516 A:middle
Let's look at an example

00:06:51.516 --> 00:06:54.436 A:middle
of a sample app we have been
working on called IconReel.

00:06:55.676 --> 00:06:58.186 A:middle
So here is our app
right out of the box.

00:06:58.936 --> 00:07:00.756 A:middle
It starts with a
handful of icons.



00:06:58.936 --> 00:07:00.756 A:middle
It starts with a
handful of icons.

00:07:01.206 --> 00:07:04.326 A:middle
When the user taps on an
icon, we zoom up the icon

00:07:04.326 --> 00:07:05.556 A:middle
to show a more detailed view.

00:07:06.456 --> 00:07:08.966 A:middle
There is a sticky
dock at the bottom

00:07:08.966 --> 00:07:11.486 A:middle
where users can save
their favorite icons.

00:07:11.986 --> 00:07:15.146 A:middle
When a user adds more
icons, we add more pages,

00:07:15.146 --> 00:07:17.066 A:middle
and the user can scroll
between the pages.

00:07:18.366 --> 00:07:19.516 A:middle
Does this look familiar
to anyone?

00:07:19.516 --> 00:07:19.966 A:middle
Yeah, that was on purpose

00:07:20.086 --> 00:07:22.086 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:07:22.156 --> 00:07:26.786 A:middle
&gt;&gt; BRITTANY PAINE: So we
can keep all of these icons

00:07:26.786 --> 00:07:29.796 A:middle
in memory because each icon
is only about 60 kilobytes.

00:07:29.796 --> 00:07:32.936 A:middle
We will store them all
in an NSDictionary.

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:35.646 A:middle
It turns out scrolling is great.

00:07:36.326 --> 00:07:38.706 A:middle
Why? Because we have no
other pages to scroll to.

00:07:39.666 --> 00:07:42.276 A:middle
So some of our users
like to add more icons.

00:07:42.766 --> 00:07:46.336 A:middle
So we add a few dozen more
icons to our NSDictionary.

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:48.356 A:middle
So far scrolling is okay.

00:07:49.566 --> 00:07:51.656 A:middle
Now, this animation may
look familiar to you.

00:07:51.906 --> 00:07:53.376 A:middle
That's because there
are a lot of apps

00:07:53.576 --> 00:07:54.826 A:middle
that have an animation
like this.

00:07:55.716 --> 00:08:00.076 A:middle
Think of photos scrolling around
in a photos or videos app.



00:07:55.716 --> 00:08:00.076 A:middle
Think of photos scrolling around
in a photos or videos app.

00:08:00.206 --> 00:08:03.936 A:middle
You may have an animation
like this in your app.

00:08:04.076 --> 00:08:05.136 A:middle
Everything is going great.

00:08:05.136 --> 00:08:07.706 A:middle
Some of our really good
customers download even

00:08:07.706 --> 00:08:08.646 A:middle
more icons.

00:08:09.086 --> 00:08:12.776 A:middle
And now we have several dozen
more icons in our NSDictionary,

00:08:12.776 --> 00:08:15.826 A:middle
and it turns out
scrolling is still perfect.

00:08:16.936 --> 00:08:20.886 A:middle
That is, until sometimes we
are seeing IconReel crash,

00:08:21.356 --> 00:08:24.806 A:middle
and sometimes in a multitasking
environment we are seeing other

00:08:24.896 --> 00:08:27.236 A:middle
foreground apps crash.

00:08:27.236 --> 00:08:29.386 A:middle
Let's invest what
is going on here.

00:08:30.696 --> 00:08:33.676 A:middle
We took a time profiler
trace and saw that CPU

00:08:33.676 --> 00:08:35.566 A:middle
and disk I/O were
minimal while scrolling.

00:08:35.566 --> 00:08:39.966 A:middle
But the Allocations instrument
showed us our memory usage was

00:08:39.966 --> 00:08:43.476 A:middle
very high because all of our
icons were kept in memory.

00:08:44.066 --> 00:08:46.846 A:middle
What is happening here is

00:08:46.846 --> 00:08:49.746 A:middle
that IconReel is quickly
exhausting the available system

00:08:49.746 --> 00:08:52.626 A:middle
memory, and when the system
gets short on free memory,

00:08:53.316 --> 00:08:54.486 A:middle
it tries to free some up.

00:08:54.486 --> 00:08:57.556 A:middle
If there's none it can find,
it has to terminate processes.

00:08:58.406 --> 00:09:00.616 A:middle
Sometimes this means
terminating IconReel,



00:08:58.406 --> 00:09:00.616 A:middle
Sometimes this means
terminating IconReel,

00:09:01.126 --> 00:09:03.156 A:middle
and sometimes this means
terminating another

00:09:03.156 --> 00:09:03.826 A:middle
foreground app.

00:09:04.336 --> 00:09:07.216 A:middle
But all of the time this is
a horrible user experience.

00:09:07.306 --> 00:09:08.526 A:middle
We want to avoid this.

00:09:08.856 --> 00:09:12.936 A:middle
As a good multitasking
citizen, IconReel needs

00:09:12.936 --> 00:09:16.296 A:middle
to get its memory usage
under control so all the apps

00:09:16.296 --> 00:09:19.686 A:middle
on screen can coexist and
create the great user experience

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:21.486 A:middle
that our users expect.

00:09:22.136 --> 00:09:25.226 A:middle
This brings me to the
idea of the working set.

00:09:27.276 --> 00:09:29.496 A:middle
One of the most important
things you can do

00:09:29.496 --> 00:09:32.346 A:middle
to optimize your memory
usage is to understand

00:09:32.346 --> 00:09:33.536 A:middle
and manage your working set.

00:09:35.256 --> 00:09:37.816 A:middle
Your working set should consist
of only the critical objects

00:09:37.816 --> 00:09:40.126 A:middle
and resources that your
app needs right now.

00:09:42.206 --> 00:09:43.756 A:middle
You should keep it
small in order

00:09:43.756 --> 00:09:45.116 A:middle
to keep your memory usage low.

00:09:45.876 --> 00:09:48.696 A:middle
It might change based
on context.

00:09:48.966 --> 00:09:51.626 A:middle
For example, your working set
may contain different objects

00:09:52.086 --> 00:09:53.436 A:middle
when the app is in
the foreground

00:09:53.776 --> 00:09:56.966 A:middle
versus when the app is in the
background, or it might change

00:09:57.206 --> 00:09:58.356 A:middle
when you change view
controllers.

00:09:59.656 --> 00:10:02.196 A:middle
Last, you shouldn't
let it grow unbounded.



00:09:59.656 --> 00:10:02.196 A:middle
Last, you shouldn't
let it grow unbounded.

00:10:02.646 --> 00:10:04.646 A:middle
We saw what happens when the
system runs out of memory.

00:10:05.126 --> 00:10:08.516 A:middle
We don't want you
to be that app.

00:10:08.516 --> 00:10:10.046 A:middle
Let's look at IconReel's
working set.

00:10:10.046 --> 00:10:12.286 A:middle
At the end of the last example,

00:10:12.286 --> 00:10:16.496 A:middle
IconReel's working set was every
icon we were keeping in memory.

00:10:16.496 --> 00:10:18.726 A:middle
Is this the best working set?

00:10:20.406 --> 00:10:23.826 A:middle
No. So what do we
really need right now?

00:10:25.226 --> 00:10:28.346 A:middle
Well, all we really need is
the current page of icons

00:10:28.346 --> 00:10:29.326 A:middle
that the user is viewing.

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:31.746 A:middle
So this is a much
better working set.

00:10:33.346 --> 00:10:36.426 A:middle
So now let's try scrolling
with our working set

00:10:36.696 --> 00:10:41.516 A:middle
of only one page of icons.

00:10:41.706 --> 00:10:43.656 A:middle
Oh! Oh! Okay.

00:10:43.956 --> 00:10:44.966 A:middle
That was horrible.

00:10:45.036 --> 00:10:46.816 A:middle
And if you didn't see it
because maybe I was standing

00:10:46.816 --> 00:10:50.296 A:middle
in your way, scrolling
was horrible.

00:10:50.296 --> 00:10:53.216 A:middle
There was a multisecond
hang before the next page

00:10:53.216 --> 00:10:54.426 A:middle
of icons scrolled into view.

00:10:56.046 --> 00:10:58.766 A:middle
Let's investigate
what is going on.

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:03.746 A:middle
We took another time profiler
trace, and we saw that CPU



00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:03.746 A:middle
We took another time profiler
trace, and we saw that CPU

00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:06.296 A:middle
and disk I/O are actually
very high while scrolling,

00:11:06.936 --> 00:11:10.456 A:middle
and Allocation showed us that
our memory usage is very low.

00:11:11.436 --> 00:11:15.906 A:middle
This is the exact opposite
problem from what we just had.

00:11:15.906 --> 00:11:18.456 A:middle
Like I said, great performance
involves making a series

00:11:18.456 --> 00:11:19.216 A:middle
of trade-offs.

00:11:20.026 --> 00:11:22.006 A:middle
What can we do to fix this?

00:11:22.656 --> 00:11:25.216 A:middle
The answer is to manage
our CPU time better.

00:11:26.706 --> 00:11:28.326 A:middle
So the most important
thing you can do

00:11:28.326 --> 00:11:31.396 A:middle
to keep your app responsive
is to do as little work

00:11:31.396 --> 00:11:32.986 A:middle
as possible on your main thread.

00:11:34.076 --> 00:11:36.996 A:middle
The main thread's top priority
is to respond to user events,

00:11:37.456 --> 00:11:40.186 A:middle
and doing unnecessary work
on your main thread means

00:11:40.186 --> 00:11:42.896 A:middle
that the main thread has less
time to respond to user events.

00:11:44.596 --> 00:11:47.006 A:middle
Because you're sharing the
CPU time with all of the apps

00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:49.346 A:middle
on screen, you need
to be hyperaware

00:11:49.346 --> 00:11:50.706 A:middle
of what your main
thread is doing.

00:11:51.646 --> 00:11:54.676 A:middle
Any work being performed on the
main thread that is not directly

00:11:54.676 --> 00:11:57.476 A:middle
in response to a user event
should be performed elsewhere.

00:11:59.426 --> 00:12:01.956 A:middle
What tools can we use to make
sure that we keep responding



00:11:59.426 --> 00:12:01.956 A:middle
What tools can we use to make
sure that we keep responding

00:12:01.956 --> 00:12:04.966 A:middle
to user events but also make
sure we get the extra work

00:12:04.966 --> 00:12:06.146 A:middle
finished in a timely manner?

00:12:07.826 --> 00:12:10.776 A:middle
Well, the answer is we can use
GCD and Quality of Service.

00:12:12.156 --> 00:12:15.276 A:middle
There was a great talk
last year at WWDC 2014,

00:12:15.726 --> 00:12:18.286 A:middle
and there's a great talk
coming up on Friday on GCD

00:12:18.286 --> 00:12:19.396 A:middle
and Quality of Service.

00:12:19.396 --> 00:12:21.206 A:middle
So I'm not going to go
into a lot of detail here.

00:12:21.786 --> 00:12:23.436 A:middle
There's two important things.

00:12:24.036 --> 00:12:26.786 A:middle
The first thing is that
your main thread is running

00:12:26.786 --> 00:12:29.686 A:middle
at the highest priority, that's
the user interactive priority.

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:33.186 A:middle
The other thing is
that the Quality

00:12:33.186 --> 00:12:34.856 A:middle
of Service bands are shared

00:12:34.856 --> 00:12:36.576 A:middle
across all foreground
applications.

00:12:37.266 --> 00:12:39.936 A:middle
So everyone's user-initiated
queues get equal access

00:12:39.976 --> 00:12:42.826 A:middle
to the CPU, and everyone's
background queues get equal

00:12:42.856 --> 00:12:43.866 A:middle
access to the CPU.

00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:48.726 A:middle
No single foreground app is
prioritized above any other.

00:12:49.206 --> 00:12:51.416 A:middle
If you prioritize your
work appropriately,

00:12:51.706 --> 00:12:55.006 A:middle
the system can guarantee
that we get the best possible

00:12:55.006 --> 00:12:57.026 A:middle
performance while there are
multiple apps on screen.

00:12:57.626 --> 00:13:00.706 A:middle
So how does this
apply to IconReel?



00:12:57.626 --> 00:13:00.706 A:middle
So how does this
apply to IconReel?

00:13:01.666 --> 00:13:03.746 A:middle
Well, we are going
to load the icons

00:13:03.746 --> 00:13:05.646 A:middle
on a separate thread using GCD

00:13:05.646 --> 00:13:07.976 A:middle
at the user-initiated
Quality of Service.

00:13:09.236 --> 00:13:12.086 A:middle
The first thing we do, we
create our dispatch queue,

00:13:12.446 --> 00:13:16.536 A:middle
called Icon Generation Queue,
and it's a serial queue.

00:13:16.536 --> 00:13:19.766 A:middle
While we are on the main thread,
we're going to dispatch async,

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:22.826 A:middle
generating each icon on the
next page onto our icon queue.

00:13:23.896 --> 00:13:26.256 A:middle
It isn't obvious from
this code snippet,

00:13:26.516 --> 00:13:29.846 A:middle
but dispatch asyncing work
from the main thread to a queue

00:13:29.846 --> 00:13:33.036 A:middle
like this downgrades
the quality of service

00:13:33.616 --> 00:13:35.686 A:middle
to the user-initiated
quality of service,

00:13:35.766 --> 00:13:38.546 A:middle
which is the second-highest
quality of service.

00:13:39.396 --> 00:13:42.156 A:middle
So this code is effectively
loading all the icons

00:13:42.156 --> 00:13:44.146 A:middle
at the user-initiated
quality of service.

00:13:45.856 --> 00:13:47.576 A:middle
Okay. So let's try
scrolling again.

00:13:47.646 --> 00:13:48.326 A:middle
All right.

00:13:50.096 --> 00:13:52.206 A:middle
That was better.

00:13:53.436 --> 00:13:56.076 A:middle
This solution could work
for you and your apps

00:13:56.246 --> 00:13:58.196 A:middle
if your design allows for it.

00:13:58.256 --> 00:14:01.166 A:middle
Let's say you can show
placeholder images while you are



00:13:58.256 --> 00:14:01.166 A:middle
Let's say you can show
placeholder images while you are

00:14:01.166 --> 00:14:02.546 A:middle
waiting for the real
content to load.

00:14:03.266 --> 00:14:06.236 A:middle
However, IconReel's design
doesn't allow for it.

00:14:06.386 --> 00:14:09.666 A:middle
We have to have the icon
already loaded before it scrolls

00:14:09.666 --> 00:14:10.256 A:middle
on screen.

00:14:11.716 --> 00:14:14.086 A:middle
So what we really
need, we need a way

00:14:14.216 --> 00:14:17.196 A:middle
to temporarily boost the
icon generation queue

00:14:17.506 --> 00:14:19.856 A:middle
up to the same priority
as the main thread,

00:14:20.186 --> 00:14:22.336 A:middle
right before the icon
scrolls on to screen

00:14:22.336 --> 00:14:26.556 A:middle
so that it can finish
generating the icon faster.

00:14:26.606 --> 00:14:27.636 A:middle
There's a way to do that, too.

00:14:28.546 --> 00:14:30.836 A:middle
It's by using the quality
of service overrides.

00:14:32.596 --> 00:14:35.656 A:middle
This comes in handy when we have
this type of priority inversion

00:14:35.656 --> 00:14:38.286 A:middle
where we have a high-priority
thread or queue blocked,

00:14:38.726 --> 00:14:41.746 A:middle
waiting on a low-priority thread
or queue to finish some work.

00:14:42.996 --> 00:14:45.466 A:middle
And the awesome part
is that quality

00:14:45.466 --> 00:14:47.976 A:middle
of service overrides can
happen for you automatically

00:14:47.976 --> 00:14:49.946 A:middle
if you provide the system
with enough information.

00:14:50.946 --> 00:14:54.296 A:middle
You may be thinking: Brittany,
how can I provide the system

00:14:54.296 --> 00:14:55.326 A:middle
with enough information?

00:14:56.566 --> 00:14:57.816 A:middle
Well, here is a handy chart.

00:14:58.966 --> 00:15:01.166 A:middle
Again, the talk from last
year and the talk coming



00:14:58.966 --> 00:15:01.166 A:middle
Again, the talk from last
year and the talk coming

00:15:01.166 --> 00:15:03.316 A:middle
up on Friday go into
this in more depth.

00:15:04.016 --> 00:15:06.376 A:middle
But the take-home here is
that Dispatch Group Wait

00:15:06.776 --> 00:15:10.286 A:middle
and Dispatch Semaphore
Wait are not your friends.

00:15:10.546 --> 00:15:12.926 A:middle
You should audit your code
for uses of these functions

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:15.676 A:middle
and be aware that they
don't fix these types

00:15:15.676 --> 00:15:16.726 A:middle
of priority inversions.

00:15:18.706 --> 00:15:22.626 A:middle
So let's look at what we
are going to do in IconReel.

00:15:22.906 --> 00:15:26.546 A:middle
Right before that first column
of icons scroll on screen,

00:15:27.376 --> 00:15:28.616 A:middle
on the main thread we are going

00:15:28.616 --> 00:15:32.056 A:middle
to dispatch sync this empty
block onto our icon queue.

00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:36.916 A:middle
What that will do is boost
the priority of the icon queue

00:15:36.916 --> 00:15:39.176 A:middle
up to match the priority
of the main thread

00:15:39.456 --> 00:15:41.026 A:middle
until that block executes,

00:15:41.336 --> 00:15:43.826 A:middle
at which point the
icon queue will go back

00:15:43.826 --> 00:15:45.016 A:middle
down to its normal priority.

00:15:46.086 --> 00:15:54.726 A:middle
Now let's look at scrolling
and see what it looks like.

00:15:54.726 --> 00:15:58.186 A:middle
Oh, yeah, looks great,
with a nice slow swipe.

00:15:59.476 --> 00:16:07.446 A:middle
So let's try a slow swipe
followed by a fast swipe.



00:15:59.476 --> 00:16:07.446 A:middle
So let's try a slow swipe
followed by a fast swipe.

00:16:07.596 --> 00:16:10.736 A:middle
Oh, man! We are right
back to where we started

00:16:11.026 --> 00:16:12.876 A:middle
where that next page, there's

00:16:12.876 --> 00:16:14.576 A:middle
like a hang before
it comes on screen.

00:16:15.506 --> 00:16:16.396 A:middle
So now what?

00:16:18.026 --> 00:16:20.176 A:middle
There is a pattern here.

00:16:20.686 --> 00:16:22.166 A:middle
Pulled out Instruments again.

00:16:22.166 --> 00:16:23.096 A:middle
We took another trace.

00:16:23.426 --> 00:16:25.416 A:middle
This time we also
got a calculator,

00:16:25.946 --> 00:16:29.856 A:middle
and we did some math, and we
found that we just can't load,

00:16:30.246 --> 00:16:34.326 A:middle
read the icon image from
disk, decode the icon image,

00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:37.456 A:middle
and make the icon nice and
pretty in the amount of time

00:16:37.456 --> 00:16:39.946 A:middle
that it takes for a fast user
to swipe to the next page.

00:16:41.446 --> 00:16:42.366 A:middle
So now what?

00:16:43.816 --> 00:16:45.946 A:middle
I guess we can just
wait for faster devices.

00:16:47.016 --> 00:16:49.016 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:16:49.016 --> 00:16:50.000 A:middle
[Applause]

00:16:50.046 --> 00:16:54.556 A:middle
&gt;&gt; BRITTANY PAINE:
Some applause for that.

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:55.216 A:middle
Just kidding.

00:16:55.656 --> 00:16:56.456 A:middle
We can do better.

00:16:56.616 --> 00:16:57.616 A:middle
We have to be smarter.

00:16:57.616 --> 00:17:02.096 A:middle
Math calculations told us
we would have much better



00:16:57.616 --> 00:17:02.096 A:middle
Math calculations told us
we would have much better

00:17:02.096 --> 00:17:03.866 A:middle
performance if we
had the next page

00:17:03.866 --> 00:17:05.786 A:middle
of icons already
loaded in memory.

00:17:06.945 --> 00:17:10.776 A:middle
This ensures that even when
you are scrolling quickly

00:17:10.776 --> 00:17:12.935 A:middle
through multiple pages,
we have enough time

00:17:12.935 --> 00:17:15.766 A:middle
to load the next page of icons
before the user can swipe again.

00:17:17.736 --> 00:17:20.766 A:middle
So let's increase our
working set size from one page

00:17:20.766 --> 00:17:23.685 A:middle
to three pages: the page
you're currently viewing

00:17:23.685 --> 00:17:24.796 A:middle
and the page on either side.

00:17:25.796 --> 00:17:27.366 A:middle
We don't have a magic
eight ball.

00:17:27.496 --> 00:17:30.166 A:middle
So we don't know which way
the user is about to scroll.

00:17:30.606 --> 00:17:33.766 A:middle
Having one page on either side
seems like the best compromise.

00:17:33.906 --> 00:17:36.246 A:middle
Now let's try scrolling.

00:17:36.596 --> 00:17:37.686 A:middle
All right.

00:17:42.776 --> 00:17:44.076 A:middle
That looks much better.

00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:47.266 A:middle
Now by the time the user
gets to the next page,

00:17:47.266 --> 00:17:50.836 A:middle
we've already started loading
the next page of icons.

00:17:51.016 --> 00:17:54.216 A:middle
However, this actually
increases our memory usage.

00:17:54.216 --> 00:17:57.056 A:middle
When we had our working set
that contained only one page,

00:17:57.056 --> 00:17:58.326 A:middle
we had this memory footprint.

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:00.716 A:middle
Now we have this
memory footprint.



00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:00.716 A:middle
Now we have this
memory footprint.

00:18:00.716 --> 00:18:05.206 A:middle
We need to be aware of how
we are affecting other apps.

00:18:05.706 --> 00:18:08.126 A:middle
So now let's look at what
happens when the user brings

00:18:08.126 --> 00:18:10.596 A:middle
in a secondary app with
IconReel already on screen.

00:18:11.656 --> 00:18:16.196 A:middle
IconReel resizes to show only
three columns instead of four.

00:18:17.206 --> 00:18:20.376 A:middle
This is a great opportunity
to reassess our working set.

00:18:21.196 --> 00:18:24.516 A:middle
Do we still need three
pages of four columns

00:18:24.516 --> 00:18:26.076 A:middle
of icons in memory at a time?

00:18:27.126 --> 00:18:30.636 A:middle
No. We only need three
pages of three columns

00:18:30.636 --> 00:18:31.756 A:middle
of icons in memory at a time.

00:18:32.996 --> 00:18:36.326 A:middle
So effectively it looks
a little bit like this.

00:18:36.426 --> 00:18:38.776 A:middle
Now, I could go through

00:18:38.776 --> 00:18:41.866 A:middle
and manually throw away
those extra columns of icons

00:18:41.866 --> 00:18:44.376 A:middle
that we don't need
anymore, but it was a lot

00:18:44.376 --> 00:18:45.916 A:middle
of work to generate them.

00:18:46.056 --> 00:18:49.136 A:middle
I don't want to redo
it if I don't have to.

00:18:49.136 --> 00:18:50.856 A:middle
It would be great
if there was a place

00:18:51.066 --> 00:18:53.126 A:middle
where I could put
these icons where,

00:18:53.506 --> 00:18:56.726 A:middle
if the system needed the memory,
we could get rid of them.

00:18:56.726 --> 00:18:59.886 A:middle
If the system didn't need the
memory, then they could stay

00:18:59.886 --> 00:19:01.576 A:middle
in memory for us so that
we could use them again



00:18:59.886 --> 00:19:01.576 A:middle
in memory for us so that
we could use them again

00:19:01.576 --> 00:19:02.166 A:middle
when we need them.

00:19:03.056 --> 00:19:04.426 A:middle
There is a way to do that,

00:19:04.816 --> 00:19:07.066 A:middle
and that is by listening
to memory warnings.

00:19:09.486 --> 00:19:13.086 A:middle
Memory warnings happen when the
system is under memory pressure

00:19:13.146 --> 00:19:15.706 A:middle
or your process is
approaching its memory limit.

00:19:18.056 --> 00:19:20.236 A:middle
I'd really like to give you
a number that you could code

00:19:20.236 --> 00:19:21.616 A:middle
to for your memory limit.

00:19:22.116 --> 00:19:23.836 A:middle
Unfortunately, there's
no such number.

00:19:24.466 --> 00:19:26.276 A:middle
The limit is different
per device

00:19:26.476 --> 00:19:28.156 A:middle
and per application context.

00:19:28.666 --> 00:19:31.256 A:middle
So my best advice
is to just listen

00:19:31.256 --> 00:19:33.526 A:middle
for memory warnings
and do things.

00:19:34.216 --> 00:19:36.286 A:middle
So what should you do?

00:19:37.266 --> 00:19:39.656 A:middle
Well, you should remove anything
not in your working set.

00:19:39.926 --> 00:19:43.226 A:middle
This includes clearing cache
data, releasing images,

00:19:43.226 --> 00:19:44.526 A:middle
and releasing view controllers.

00:19:44.606 --> 00:19:49.376 A:middle
Here is the APIs that
you can use to listen

00:19:49.376 --> 00:19:52.616 A:middle
for memory warnings, and I
want to make it clear that none

00:19:52.616 --> 00:19:54.546 A:middle
of these are new in iOS 9.

00:19:54.546 --> 00:19:56.236 A:middle
They have been around
for a while.

00:19:56.556 --> 00:20:00.326 A:middle
Hopefully y'all are
already using all of them.



00:19:56.556 --> 00:20:00.326 A:middle
Hopefully y'all are
already using all of them.

00:20:00.976 --> 00:20:03.956 A:middle
I could go through on a memory
warning and manually get rid

00:20:03.956 --> 00:20:05.096 A:middle
of these icons myself.

00:20:05.196 --> 00:20:08.376 A:middle
I'm lazy and don't
want to do that.

00:20:08.816 --> 00:20:11.606 A:middle
It would be great if there was a
tool that managed all that crap

00:20:11.656 --> 00:20:14.396 A:middle
for me so I didn't
have to do it.

00:20:14.446 --> 00:20:15.816 A:middle
Turns out we have
one of those, too.

00:20:16.266 --> 00:20:16.936 A:middle
It is called NSCache.

00:20:16.936 --> 00:20:20.426 A:middle
It is similar to an
NSDictionary, and it's great

00:20:20.426 --> 00:20:22.396 A:middle
for objects that can
be re-created quickly.

00:20:23.546 --> 00:20:25.416 A:middle
It also handles the
memory warnings for you

00:20:25.416 --> 00:20:29.276 A:middle
by automatically evicting items
from itself, and it's also aware

00:20:29.276 --> 00:20:32.116 A:middle
of application context like
foreground versus background

00:20:32.436 --> 00:20:33.896 A:middle
and evicts items when necessary.

00:20:35.216 --> 00:20:37.766 A:middle
It does other cool stuff,
too, but we don't have time

00:20:37.766 --> 00:20:38.836 A:middle
to talk about that today.

00:20:39.016 --> 00:20:41.276 A:middle
Make sure to check out
the NSCache documentation.

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:46.836 A:middle
Now when we have IconReel
up in a split view,

00:20:47.296 --> 00:20:49.136 A:middle
instead of throwing
away these icons,

00:20:49.696 --> 00:20:50.796 A:middle
let's put them in an NSCache.

00:20:50.856 --> 00:20:55.306 A:middle
In fact, let's just put every
icon we ever generate that's not

00:20:55.306 --> 00:20:58.046 A:middle
in our working set in NSCache.

00:20:58.046 --> 00:20:59.466 A:middle
And when we have
a memory warning,

00:20:59.726 --> 00:21:03.216 A:middle
we can let NSCache do all the
work of evicting all those icons



00:20:59.726 --> 00:21:03.216 A:middle
we can let NSCache do all the
work of evicting all those icons

00:21:03.216 --> 00:21:06.446 A:middle
that are not in our working set.

00:21:06.446 --> 00:21:06.966 A:middle
Let's recap.

00:21:07.606 --> 00:21:10.746 A:middle
We started here, where we
had every icon in memory.

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:14.216 A:middle
So our memory usage was high,
but scrolling was great and CUP

00:21:14.216 --> 00:21:15.446 A:middle
and disk I/O were low.

00:21:16.026 --> 00:21:17.496 A:middle
But sometimes we were
seeing apps crash,

00:21:18.056 --> 00:21:20.576 A:middle
and that is not good.

00:21:20.796 --> 00:21:23.336 A:middle
So then we adjusted our working
set size to only one page

00:21:23.336 --> 00:21:26.776 A:middle
of icons, so the memory
usage was low, but our CPU

00:21:26.776 --> 00:21:28.656 A:middle
and disk I/O were very
high while scrolling,

00:21:28.816 --> 00:21:30.826 A:middle
and this resulted in crappy
scrolling performance.

00:21:33.176 --> 00:21:36.996 A:middle
Then, we revised our working set
size to be three pages of icons,

00:21:37.456 --> 00:21:39.476 A:middle
which increased our
memory usage a little bit.

00:21:39.856 --> 00:21:42.606 A:middle
And then every other icon
that we generated that was not

00:21:42.606 --> 00:21:46.336 A:middle
in our working set we
threw into NSCache.

00:21:46.536 --> 00:21:48.366 A:middle
We have increased our
overall memory usage,

00:21:48.366 --> 00:21:50.286 A:middle
but most of our increase
is now adaptable

00:21:50.286 --> 00:21:51.646 A:middle
to the surrounding
circumstances.

00:21:53.346 --> 00:21:54.876 A:middle
For many of you this
is good enough.

00:21:55.746 --> 00:21:58.416 A:middle
If your app can run in a
multitasking environment

00:21:58.566 --> 00:22:03.076 A:middle
with Maps running Flyover, then
you are probably in great shape.



00:21:58.566 --> 00:22:03.076 A:middle
with Maps running Flyover, then
you are probably in great shape.

00:22:04.296 --> 00:22:07.186 A:middle
I presented a bunch of things
that your app can do today

00:22:07.186 --> 00:22:08.736 A:middle
to be a good multitasking
citizen,

00:22:09.056 --> 00:22:12.136 A:middle
but sometimes these
things are not enough.

00:22:12.136 --> 00:22:14.026 A:middle
To talk to you about
what you should do next,

00:22:14.076 --> 00:22:14.976 A:middle
I would like to present
Jon Drummond.

00:22:15.516 --> 00:22:23.546 A:middle
[Applause]

00:22:24.046 --> 00:22:24.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JON DRUMMOND:
Thank you, Brittany.

00:22:24.806 --> 00:22:25.776 A:middle
Hi, everybody.

00:22:27.196 --> 00:22:30.366 A:middle
So understanding how your
app uses memory can pay off

00:22:30.836 --> 00:22:32.836 A:middle
tremendously for both
your app's performance

00:22:32.836 --> 00:22:33.906 A:middle
and the rest of the system.

00:22:34.176 --> 00:22:36.216 A:middle
But sometimes that
just isn't enough.

00:22:36.596 --> 00:22:38.356 A:middle
What if you are doing
everything we talked about

00:22:38.356 --> 00:22:41.526 A:middle
and doing it all correctly, but
things are still going wrong?

00:22:42.286 --> 00:22:45.526 A:middle
We will talk about some ways
to be even more adaptive

00:22:45.576 --> 00:22:47.816 A:middle
with the way that your apps
manage their memory footprint.

00:22:49.126 --> 00:22:52.316 A:middle
To start, I would like to go
back to the multitasking example

00:22:52.316 --> 00:22:54.356 A:middle
where we have a primary
and a secondary app.

00:22:55.146 --> 00:22:57.346 A:middle
We are under memory
pressure right now,

00:22:57.346 --> 00:22:59.506 A:middle
so the system issues a
memory warning and the apps,

00:22:59.656 --> 00:23:02.006 A:middle
being good multitasking
citizens, will take care



00:22:59.656 --> 00:23:02.006 A:middle
being good multitasking
citizens, will take care

00:23:02.006 --> 00:23:04.106 A:middle
of trimming their caches and
other objects they don't need.

00:23:04.516 --> 00:23:08.716 A:middle
Great. Now, the user
brings in a PiP, okay?

00:23:08.876 --> 00:23:10.156 A:middle
We have space, it's good.

00:23:10.156 --> 00:23:12.166 A:middle
We are not under pressure,
but we are getting close.

00:23:13.396 --> 00:23:15.996 A:middle
Now the user goes and
resizes the secondary app

00:23:16.066 --> 00:23:17.706 A:middle
to be fifty-fifty
with the primary.

00:23:18.146 --> 00:23:22.796 A:middle
This causes a spike in memory
growth, and CPU for that matter.

00:23:22.796 --> 00:23:24.916 A:middle
The system did not have
time to react to this.

00:23:25.176 --> 00:23:26.646 A:middle
Unfortunately, it was forced

00:23:26.646 --> 00:23:29.496 A:middle
to kill the primary app here
even though the primary app was

00:23:29.496 --> 00:23:31.356 A:middle
not the cause of
the memory growth.

00:23:32.036 --> 00:23:34.666 A:middle
Dropping back into SpringBoard
is never a good experience,

00:23:34.666 --> 00:23:35.866 A:middle
as Brittany showed us.

00:23:37.766 --> 00:23:39.226 A:middle
Before I finish or
keep going here,

00:23:39.226 --> 00:23:43.616 A:middle
I want to share a
quote with you.

00:23:43.736 --> 00:23:47.086 A:middle
That is that "the world outside
your process should be regarded

00:23:47.086 --> 00:23:49.406 A:middle
as hostile and bent
upon your destruction."

00:23:50.736 --> 00:23:53.946 A:middle
I don't mean that to sound
ominous and I don't want you

00:23:53.946 --> 00:23:56.296 A:middle
to think I'm paranoid, but part

00:23:56.296 --> 00:23:58.786 A:middle
of being a good multitasking
citizen is adapting

00:23:58.926 --> 00:24:00.626 A:middle
to everything that is
happening around you.



00:23:58.926 --> 00:24:00.626 A:middle
to everything that is
happening around you.

00:24:00.746 --> 00:24:03.826 A:middle
Sometimes what is happening
around you is extreme.

00:24:04.686 --> 00:24:06.236 A:middle
You might be doing
everything fine,

00:24:06.236 --> 00:24:08.996 A:middle
but the system might
conspire to terminate you.

00:24:08.996 --> 00:24:11.546 A:middle
It is not really, but being
prepared for this kind

00:24:11.546 --> 00:24:14.056 A:middle
of situation will
help you survive.

00:24:16.536 --> 00:24:18.006 A:middle
So first things first.

00:24:18.506 --> 00:24:20.586 A:middle
Memory is the most
constrained resource on iOS.

00:24:20.996 --> 00:24:23.676 A:middle
That is not to say that other
resources are not constrained.

00:24:23.676 --> 00:24:25.836 A:middle
They are, but they just
degrade differently.

00:24:26.116 --> 00:24:27.586 A:middle
When the system runs
out of memory,

00:24:27.696 --> 00:24:28.936 A:middle
it's like hitting a wall.

00:24:28.936 --> 00:24:29.886 A:middle
Something has to go.

00:24:29.886 --> 00:24:31.466 A:middle
It's got to get the memory back.

00:24:32.466 --> 00:24:34.136 A:middle
As we saw from the
previous example,

00:24:34.556 --> 00:24:37.826 A:middle
sometimes the system can
acquire memory faster

00:24:37.826 --> 00:24:38.626 A:middle
than it can be released.

00:24:39.116 --> 00:24:41.626 A:middle
Even if we had time to issue
a memory warning there,

00:24:41.626 --> 00:24:43.686 A:middle
and even if the apps, all
three of them running,

00:24:43.686 --> 00:24:46.176 A:middle
had time to respond
to it, it's not clear

00:24:46.176 --> 00:24:47.806 A:middle
that they would have
had enough CPU cycles

00:24:47.806 --> 00:24:50.226 A:middle
to actually do something
meaningful and clean

00:24:50.226 --> 00:24:52.426 A:middle
up enough memory to
accommodate the growth.

00:24:53.586 --> 00:24:55.856 A:middle
To understand how the
system can reclaim memory,

00:24:55.856 --> 00:24:58.576 A:middle
we have to understand
how memory is classified.

00:24:58.656 --> 00:25:01.606 A:middle
I'm going to break it down
into three different groups,



00:24:58.656 --> 00:25:01.606 A:middle
I'm going to break it down
into three different groups,

00:25:01.606 --> 00:25:03.526 A:middle
the first of which
we call dirty.

00:25:03.526 --> 00:25:06.676 A:middle
This is memory in active
use by your process.

00:25:06.796 --> 00:25:09.296 A:middle
These are your objects, these
are your heap allocations,

00:25:09.586 --> 00:25:11.916 A:middle
statics, globals,
everything you have cached,

00:25:11.916 --> 00:25:13.306 A:middle
actually pretty much everything.

00:25:13.506 --> 00:25:15.196 A:middle
And it is not reclaimable
by the system

00:25:15.196 --> 00:25:16.566 A:middle
because it's in use by you.

00:25:18.176 --> 00:25:19.706 A:middle
The second is called purgeable.

00:25:20.006 --> 00:25:23.346 A:middle
This is otherwise dirty memory
that has been explicitly marked

00:25:23.576 --> 00:25:25.946 A:middle
as not in use by the app,

00:25:25.946 --> 00:25:28.556 A:middle
so the system knows it can
take it back if needed.

00:25:29.556 --> 00:25:32.206 A:middle
The third type we call clean,
and that is read-only memory

00:25:32.206 --> 00:25:33.686 A:middle
that is backed by files on disk.

00:25:34.116 --> 00:25:35.676 A:middle
The system can reclaim
the memory

00:25:35.766 --> 00:25:40.436 A:middle
because it can always bring it
back because the file is there.

00:25:40.686 --> 00:25:42.556 A:middle
Back to our system memory bars.

00:25:42.616 --> 00:25:43.756 A:middle
What does this look like?

00:25:43.836 --> 00:25:46.846 A:middle
We have a scenario with very,
very little free memory.

00:25:47.256 --> 00:25:48.966 A:middle
But it doesn't look
like that to the system.

00:25:49.606 --> 00:25:53.956 A:middle
The system knows it has leeway
to use anytime it wants to free

00:25:53.956 --> 00:25:56.216 A:middle
up memory for growth,
and it can do this

00:25:56.216 --> 00:25:57.406 A:middle
without issuing memory warnings

00:25:57.406 --> 00:25:58.886 A:middle
or requiring the
apps to intervene.

00:25:59.246 --> 00:26:05.306 A:middle
The goals for your app and for
adapting the memory usage here



00:25:59.246 --> 00:26:05.306 A:middle
The goals for your app and for
adapting the memory usage here

00:26:05.306 --> 00:26:07.026 A:middle
are minimize your dirty memory

00:26:07.766 --> 00:26:10.336 A:middle
and maximize your
purgeable and clean memory.

00:26:10.336 --> 00:26:12.566 A:middle
We are going to start
with minimizing dirty.

00:26:14.326 --> 00:26:15.996 A:middle
First, yeah, use less of it.

00:26:16.726 --> 00:26:18.906 A:middle
I know that's really easy for
me to say standing up here,

00:26:18.906 --> 00:26:21.336 A:middle
but if you manage
your working set

00:26:21.336 --> 00:26:24.096 A:middle
and track the objects you are
allocating, use Instruments,

00:26:24.096 --> 00:26:27.706 A:middle
do all that, once you've taken
care of that, the next step is

00:26:27.706 --> 00:26:30.356 A:middle
about reclassifying this
dirty memory as purgeable.

00:26:31.276 --> 00:26:33.676 A:middle
If you do this, it can be
automatically reclaimed

00:26:33.676 --> 00:26:37.166 A:middle
by the system, and it is
best for nice-to-have data,

00:26:37.166 --> 00:26:39.816 A:middle
data that you don't need right
now, might need in the future,

00:26:39.816 --> 00:26:42.416 A:middle
and anything you might otherwise
put in a cache, for example.

00:26:43.866 --> 00:26:45.156 A:middle
Let's apply this to IconReel.

00:26:46.366 --> 00:26:48.366 A:middle
This resembles the
scenario we left off.

00:26:48.366 --> 00:26:53.006 A:middle
We have caches of icons on
either side in our working set.

00:26:53.906 --> 00:26:57.536 A:middle
For this example, I'm going
to reclassify our data a bit.

00:26:57.536 --> 00:26:59.316 A:middle
Rather than working
on a per-icon chunk,

00:26:59.316 --> 00:27:02.296 A:middle
I'm going to group the
icons into sets of columns,



00:26:59.316 --> 00:27:02.296 A:middle
I'm going to group the
icons into sets of columns,

00:27:02.366 --> 00:27:04.106 A:middle
just because it makes
this a bit easier here

00:27:04.506 --> 00:27:07.346 A:middle
but it doesn't otherwise
change the dynamic of our app.

00:27:07.346 --> 00:27:09.646 A:middle
As the user scrolls around,
we update our working set,

00:27:09.696 --> 00:27:11.136 A:middle
things get cached,
things get pulled

00:27:11.136 --> 00:27:13.786 A:middle
out of the cache,
it's all the same.

00:27:13.786 --> 00:27:15.186 A:middle
Let's classify this memory use.

00:27:16.746 --> 00:27:19.116 A:middle
First, we've got
our memory in use.

00:27:19.576 --> 00:27:20.526 A:middle
Classified as dirty.

00:27:20.916 --> 00:27:21.786 A:middle
That's our working set.

00:27:23.256 --> 00:27:26.336 A:middle
We've got all the objects in
our caches, those are purgeable.

00:27:27.166 --> 00:27:29.826 A:middle
This presents us with an
interesting opportunity

00:27:30.866 --> 00:27:33.866 A:middle
to be even fancier with
the way we classify memory.

00:27:34.736 --> 00:27:41.306 A:middle
Let's, for example, mark even
more of the data as in use

00:27:41.306 --> 00:27:42.866 A:middle
or dirty, even some
that's in the cache.

00:27:43.706 --> 00:27:46.626 A:middle
What this has done for us
is introduced a second level

00:27:46.626 --> 00:27:47.066 A:middle
of caching.

00:27:48.296 --> 00:27:50.486 A:middle
The first one, the
outside-most icons,

00:27:50.896 --> 00:27:52.966 A:middle
the ones we are least
likely to need soon,

00:27:52.966 --> 00:27:55.196 A:middle
we'll let the system reclaim
whenever the system needs it.

00:27:55.196 --> 00:27:55.856 A:middle
We don't care.

00:27:56.826 --> 00:27:58.456 A:middle
But we'd like to
retain some control

00:27:58.456 --> 00:27:59.996 A:middle
over icons we might need soon.



00:28:00.696 --> 00:28:02.146 A:middle
So even though they're
still in the cache,

00:28:02.146 --> 00:28:03.066 A:middle
we're going to mark them in use

00:28:03.066 --> 00:28:05.326 A:middle
so the system can't take
them without asking.

00:28:05.726 --> 00:28:06.776 A:middle
These are the ones we'll release

00:28:06.776 --> 00:28:08.096 A:middle
when we respond to
a memory warning.

00:28:09.416 --> 00:28:10.826 A:middle
This leaves us with
the working set,

00:28:10.826 --> 00:28:12.266 A:middle
which we absolutely
need right now,

00:28:12.266 --> 00:28:13.796 A:middle
and there's nothing
to do about that.

00:28:14.466 --> 00:28:17.586 A:middle
What does this look like in
the multitasking example?

00:28:18.376 --> 00:28:21.346 A:middle
I'll return to the scenario
where things went wrong before.

00:28:21.786 --> 00:28:22.746 A:middle
The PiP has come in.

00:28:22.746 --> 00:28:23.606 A:middle
We're out of memory.

00:28:23.876 --> 00:28:25.976 A:middle
But now, the system knows
that both the primary

00:28:25.976 --> 00:28:28.506 A:middle
and the secondary app, being
good multitasking citizens,

00:28:28.796 --> 00:28:31.336 A:middle
have this region of purgeable
memory that can be cleared.

00:28:31.546 --> 00:28:34.816 A:middle
The system, without asking
or telling anybody anything,

00:28:34.816 --> 00:28:36.436 A:middle
can take that from the app

00:28:36.436 --> 00:28:39.346 A:middle
and return the system
to a good state.

00:28:40.656 --> 00:28:43.366 A:middle
But of course, the user
keeps using the device

00:28:43.366 --> 00:28:44.686 A:middle
and memory grows again.

00:28:44.686 --> 00:28:46.096 A:middle
We have another memory warning.

00:28:46.586 --> 00:28:49.436 A:middle
But since the apps have only
lost the purgeable data,

00:28:49.436 --> 00:28:51.686 A:middle
they are free to respond to
memory warnings and clear

00:28:51.686 --> 00:28:57.796 A:middle
up the caches, thus returning
the system to a good state.

00:28:57.796 --> 00:29:00.226 A:middle
How can you use purgeable
data in your apps?



00:28:57.796 --> 00:29:00.226 A:middle
How can you use purgeable
data in your apps?

00:29:00.226 --> 00:29:00.936 A:middle
It is simple.

00:29:01.086 --> 00:29:02.666 A:middle
There's a class, and
it's Purgeable Data.

00:29:02.666 --> 00:29:05.256 A:middle
And it is a subclass
of NS immutable data

00:29:05.326 --> 00:29:07.176 A:middle
with no other properties,
it is simple.

00:29:07.606 --> 00:29:09.166 A:middle
The only additions are
these three methods,

00:29:09.496 --> 00:29:11.246 A:middle
the first being Begin
Content Access.

00:29:11.356 --> 00:29:13.546 A:middle
This tells the system
you are using the memory,

00:29:13.776 --> 00:29:14.896 A:middle
and don't take it away from me.

00:29:15.616 --> 00:29:18.216 A:middle
The second, to go along with
it, is End Content Access.

00:29:18.386 --> 00:29:20.106 A:middle
The memory is now
considered purgeable,

00:29:20.106 --> 00:29:21.316 A:middle
and you may lose it at any time.

00:29:21.956 --> 00:29:24.546 A:middle
And the third, to figure out if
the system has taken it from you

00:29:24.546 --> 00:29:26.106 A:middle
when you weren't using it.

00:29:26.756 --> 00:29:31.476 A:middle
To return to the system resource
bars, this is pretty much

00:29:31.476 --> 00:29:32.896 A:middle
where we left off with Brittany.

00:29:32.896 --> 00:29:33.986 A:middle
I haven't changed anything.

00:29:33.986 --> 00:29:35.486 A:middle
The height of these
bars is all the same.

00:29:35.676 --> 00:29:38.776 A:middle
What we have done is take a
segment of our adaptive memory

00:29:38.976 --> 00:29:40.576 A:middle
and reclassified
it as purgeable.

00:29:41.286 --> 00:29:44.376 A:middle
This has made us a much
better multitasking citizen

00:29:44.376 --> 00:29:46.916 A:middle
because the system can do
work for us on our behalf

00:29:47.456 --> 00:29:50.276 A:middle
but has the same intrinsic
performance characteristic

00:29:50.366 --> 00:29:52.116 A:middle
where, if I've lost
my purgeable memory

00:29:52.296 --> 00:29:55.296 A:middle
and I've cleared my caches,
what am I going to do now?

00:29:55.296 --> 00:29:57.236 A:middle
I need to rebuild
any data I need,

00:29:57.236 --> 00:29:59.096 A:middle
and we've established
that's very expensive.

00:29:59.236 --> 00:30:02.156 A:middle
Disk I/O and CPU
spike, that's not great.



00:29:59.236 --> 00:30:02.156 A:middle
Disk I/O and CPU
spike, that's not great.

00:30:02.646 --> 00:30:06.786 A:middle
Let's, though, analyze the
data we use in our app to see

00:30:06.786 --> 00:30:10.686 A:middle
if there's something
more we can do with that.

00:30:10.896 --> 00:30:13.516 A:middle
Well, what is the data
that IconReel uses?

00:30:13.986 --> 00:30:16.686 A:middle
Well, they are icons,
and the first property is

00:30:16.686 --> 00:30:18.106 A:middle
that they are absolutely
essential.

00:30:18.136 --> 00:30:19.806 A:middle
We don't have an app
if we don't have icons.

00:30:20.016 --> 00:30:21.846 A:middle
At some point, the user
will scroll to them.

00:30:21.846 --> 00:30:22.576 A:middle
We need them.

00:30:22.576 --> 00:30:23.516 A:middle
No getting away from it.

00:30:24.776 --> 00:30:26.376 A:middle
Second, they are
expensive to generate.

00:30:27.136 --> 00:30:28.916 A:middle
Read them off the
disk, decode them,

00:30:29.066 --> 00:30:33.256 A:middle
do nice rounded corners,
whatever you want.

00:30:33.506 --> 00:30:33.966 A:middle
Expensive.

00:30:35.326 --> 00:30:37.656 A:middle
The third point, though, they
can actually be precomputed.

00:30:37.656 --> 00:30:40.146 A:middle
We know ahead of time what
the images are going to be.

00:30:40.506 --> 00:30:43.576 A:middle
If we have the spare cycles,
we can calculate them.

00:30:43.576 --> 00:30:47.386 A:middle
And the last point is that
they are largely static.

00:30:48.266 --> 00:30:49.686 A:middle
There is a very,
very good chance

00:30:49.686 --> 00:30:52.346 A:middle
if I pregenerated something,
it is going to be the same

00:30:52.516 --> 00:30:55.036 A:middle
when I actually need it because
it doesn't change frequently.

00:30:55.476 --> 00:30:56.786 A:middle
All of these points combine

00:30:57.726 --> 00:31:01.676 A:middle
to make this data a perfect
candidate for caching to a file.



00:30:57.726 --> 00:31:01.676 A:middle
to make this data a perfect
candidate for caching to a file.

00:31:02.696 --> 00:31:03.846 A:middle
Before I move on from this,

00:31:03.846 --> 00:31:06.256 A:middle
I want to make the point
this is still a cache even

00:31:06.256 --> 00:31:06.956 A:middle
if it's a file.

00:31:07.436 --> 00:31:10.686 A:middle
Don't go writing such caches
to the user's documents folder.

00:31:11.006 --> 00:31:12.696 A:middle
Keep it for your
app's cache folder

00:31:12.696 --> 00:31:14.016 A:middle
or the system's temp directory.

00:31:14.606 --> 00:31:16.996 A:middle
Back to our system resources.

00:31:17.046 --> 00:31:18.876 A:middle
We just introduced a new one.

00:31:19.466 --> 00:31:20.426 A:middle
That is disk space.

00:31:21.076 --> 00:31:25.086 A:middle
We can trade some CPU cycles
up front to generate the data,

00:31:25.906 --> 00:31:28.346 A:middle
save it off, and then when we
actually need to pull it in,

00:31:28.876 --> 00:31:32.606 A:middle
we virtually eliminated the
need for the CPU at all.

00:31:33.486 --> 00:31:36.156 A:middle
Now, you may have noticed
that I/O went up a bit there

00:31:36.156 --> 00:31:38.846 A:middle
because the fully rendered
images may be larger

00:31:38.846 --> 00:31:40.466 A:middle
than the source files.

00:31:40.466 --> 00:31:41.016 A:middle
That's okay.

00:31:41.486 --> 00:31:42.616 A:middle
These things are all
about trade-offs.

00:31:43.776 --> 00:31:47.226 A:middle
That leads me directly to
maximizing clean memory.

00:31:48.256 --> 00:31:51.036 A:middle
You may recall I said earlier
that memory backed by a file

00:31:51.036 --> 00:31:52.756 A:middle
on disk is considered clean.

00:31:53.246 --> 00:31:55.156 A:middle
Well, we have a file
on disk now.

00:31:55.256 --> 00:31:55.926 A:middle
What a coincidence.

00:31:56.626 --> 00:31:58.346 A:middle
Data in such a file
can be memory mapped.

00:31:58.426 --> 00:32:00.896 A:middle
The system will allocate
a chunk of memory for you



00:31:58.426 --> 00:32:00.896 A:middle
The system will allocate
a chunk of memory for you

00:32:00.896 --> 00:32:03.786 A:middle
that directly maps the file, the
contents of the file, on disk.

00:32:03.786 --> 00:32:07.076 A:middle
It is most definitely
worth noting that memory

00:32:07.076 --> 00:32:09.846 A:middle
in the file contents
must match exactly.

00:32:10.296 --> 00:32:13.586 A:middle
You cannot memory map a file
that needs further decoding,

00:32:13.586 --> 00:32:16.186 A:middle
or what have you,
after it is loaded in.

00:32:16.796 --> 00:32:19.806 A:middle
This is ideal for read-only
data, as I mentioned,

00:32:19.806 --> 00:32:20.816 A:middle
that doesn't change frequently.

00:32:22.296 --> 00:32:25.436 A:middle
The coolest part about
all of this is the same

00:32:25.436 --> 00:32:26.606 A:middle
with purgeable memory,

00:32:26.866 --> 00:32:30.446 A:middle
the system can reclaim any
free memory from you as needed.

00:32:31.296 --> 00:32:33.146 A:middle
But, it is not gone.

00:32:33.616 --> 00:32:35.616 A:middle
When you need it again,
when you access again,

00:32:35.796 --> 00:32:38.006 A:middle
the system loads it
back from the disk,

00:32:38.006 --> 00:32:39.156 A:middle
and it's like it
never went away.

00:32:40.736 --> 00:32:42.916 A:middle
Furthermore, it has great
random access properties.

00:32:42.956 --> 00:32:45.126 A:middle
Just because your working set
is here and you need a piece

00:32:45.126 --> 00:32:46.726 A:middle
of data over here,
doesn't matter.

00:32:47.036 --> 00:32:49.016 A:middle
The system can just read
that portion of the file,

00:32:49.076 --> 00:32:50.846 A:middle
hand it off to you,
and you're good to go.

00:32:51.286 --> 00:32:53.826 A:middle
What does this look like?

00:32:54.086 --> 00:32:55.376 A:middle
We start with our
data in memory.

00:32:56.066 --> 00:32:58.116 A:middle
And you write it out to disk.

00:32:58.806 --> 00:33:00.846 A:middle
The system now considers
this, that memory map.



00:32:58.806 --> 00:33:00.846 A:middle
The system now considers
this, that memory map.

00:33:00.846 --> 00:33:05.816 A:middle
If you go to access a chunk
of it, all it does is load

00:33:05.816 --> 00:33:07.386 A:middle
that in, hand it off to you.

00:33:07.456 --> 00:33:09.996 A:middle
When you are not using it
anymore, it takes it away.

00:33:10.766 --> 00:33:14.146 A:middle
How can we apply
this to IconReel?

00:33:14.906 --> 00:33:17.546 A:middle
We'll start with the working
set, but actually we are going

00:33:17.546 --> 00:33:18.856 A:middle
to combine the working set

00:33:19.186 --> 00:33:21.396 A:middle
with every other icon
image we generated

00:33:21.546 --> 00:33:29.316 A:middle
and create one big data
file and write that to disk.

00:33:29.486 --> 00:33:32.426 A:middle
Now, back in our app, we
bring back our working set.

00:33:32.426 --> 00:33:32.936 A:middle
Three pages.

00:33:34.546 --> 00:33:36.466 A:middle
We access those three
pages of memory,

00:33:36.466 --> 00:33:39.296 A:middle
and the system just loads
only that portion of the file

00:33:39.296 --> 00:33:41.536 A:middle
into memory for us, keeping
the rest of this clean.

00:33:41.786 --> 00:33:44.196 A:middle
Doesn't matter if that file goes
out for hundreds of megabytes.

00:33:44.196 --> 00:33:45.726 A:middle
It is not there in memory.

00:33:46.126 --> 00:33:47.926 A:middle
As we scroll around,
the same happens.

00:33:48.826 --> 00:33:50.206 A:middle
System loads in the
data we need.

00:33:50.626 --> 00:33:53.446 A:middle
Say if we introduce a feature
that shows notifications

00:33:53.446 --> 00:33:55.636 A:middle
for icons that may be
elsewhere on the home screen,

00:33:55.836 --> 00:33:57.546 A:middle
we can pull those
in without worrying

00:33:57.546 --> 00:33:58.826 A:middle
about where they
are, what they are.

00:33:59.416 --> 00:34:02.966 A:middle
Virtual memory system does
all the heavy lifting for us.



00:33:59.416 --> 00:34:02.966 A:middle
Virtual memory system does
all the heavy lifting for us.

00:34:04.776 --> 00:34:06.856 A:middle
How does this change our
system resource bars?

00:34:07.656 --> 00:34:09.166 A:middle
We've already killed CPU there.

00:34:09.166 --> 00:34:12.146 A:middle
But now our cache
is actually on disk.

00:34:12.146 --> 00:34:13.686 A:middle
So that goes away, too.

00:34:14.476 --> 00:34:16.926 A:middle
And now our only memory
footprint is the working set.

00:34:17.166 --> 00:34:18.686 A:middle
Everything else is
considered clean

00:34:19.206 --> 00:34:20.536 A:middle
and thus does not
count against us.

00:34:21.366 --> 00:34:25.656 A:middle
It is also worth noting that we
effectively eliminated the CPU

00:34:25.686 --> 00:34:28.775 A:middle
requirements on both
the front and back end

00:34:28.775 --> 00:34:29.846 A:middle
of our data's life cycle.

00:34:30.186 --> 00:34:32.835 A:middle
We no longer need CPU
to generate data to show

00:34:32.835 --> 00:34:35.326 A:middle
to the user, nor do we
need CPU to clean it

00:34:35.326 --> 00:34:36.755 A:middle
up in response to
memory warnings.

00:34:36.786 --> 00:34:38.786 A:middle
The system is doing
all of that for us.

00:34:40.186 --> 00:34:41.565 A:middle
How can you use memory map data?

00:34:42.106 --> 00:34:44.476 A:middle
Once again, it's a
simple API on NSData.

00:34:44.476 --> 00:34:46.726 A:middle
There are some options
you can use

00:34:46.775 --> 00:34:48.376 A:middle
to initialize the data object.

00:34:48.775 --> 00:34:51.616 A:middle
If you specified the mapped
option in your initializer,

00:34:52.096 --> 00:34:54.545 A:middle
you will get a memory
map data file.

00:34:54.545 --> 00:34:59.326 A:middle
I would be remiss, however,
if I did not mention

00:34:59.326 --> 00:35:01.236 A:middle
that there were caveats
with using this system.



00:34:59.326 --> 00:35:01.236 A:middle
that there were caveats
with using this system.

00:35:02.186 --> 00:35:04.066 A:middle
The first being that
it is not appropriate

00:35:04.066 --> 00:35:05.156 A:middle
for small chunks of data.

00:35:05.456 --> 00:35:07.496 A:middle
The virtual memory
itself works on pages,

00:35:07.496 --> 00:35:09.176 A:middle
which are small chunks of data.

00:35:09.426 --> 00:35:13.786 A:middle
If yours are even smaller,
you will introduce problems

00:35:13.856 --> 00:35:16.036 A:middle
that overshadow what you are
actually trying to solve.

00:35:16.726 --> 00:35:19.676 A:middle
Furthermore, from
memory map files,

00:35:20.106 --> 00:35:22.716 A:middle
if you memory mapped a
thousand icon files, say,

00:35:22.716 --> 00:35:25.846 A:middle
there is actually a limit to the
open files any process can have.

00:35:25.846 --> 00:35:27.456 A:middle
You can get yourself
into trouble that way.

00:35:28.006 --> 00:35:29.216 A:middle
That's one of the main reasons

00:35:29.216 --> 00:35:31.686 A:middle
in our examples we grouped
the data into larger chunks

00:35:31.726 --> 00:35:35.326 A:middle
to make it more manageable
for the VM system.

00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:38.096 A:middle
You can also just misuse
the virtual memory system.

00:35:38.156 --> 00:35:41.226 A:middle
Each purgeable data object
you create creates a region

00:35:41.226 --> 00:35:42.446 A:middle
in your virtual memory space.

00:35:42.816 --> 00:35:45.376 A:middle
If you create too many of
these memory map files, too,

00:35:45.376 --> 00:35:47.156 A:middle
you can fragment
your entire space.

00:35:47.156 --> 00:35:49.226 A:middle
You can similarly exhaust it.

00:35:49.496 --> 00:35:51.826 A:middle
If you decide to memory map
a file that is ten gigabytes,

00:35:51.826 --> 00:35:53.556 A:middle
you're going to run
out of space entirely.

00:35:54.866 --> 00:35:58.796 A:middle
Unfortunately, abusing the
virtual memory system results

00:35:58.796 --> 00:36:00.206 A:middle
in your process being
terminated,



00:35:58.796 --> 00:36:00.206 A:middle
in your process being
terminated,

00:36:00.246 --> 00:36:02.256 A:middle
which is what we are here to
avoid in the first place, right?

00:36:02.256 --> 00:36:07.376 A:middle
In order to give the best
multitasking experience

00:36:07.376 --> 00:36:10.246 A:middle
to the user, it is really
important to understand the data

00:36:10.246 --> 00:36:13.416 A:middle
and the characteristics of
the data that your app uses.

00:36:14.086 --> 00:36:16.836 A:middle
You must be able to
differentiate nice-to-have data

00:36:17.186 --> 00:36:19.516 A:middle
from the essential data
you need right now.

00:36:20.246 --> 00:36:21.596 A:middle
Can your data be precomputed?

00:36:21.796 --> 00:36:23.536 A:middle
How expensive is
it to re-create?

00:36:24.186 --> 00:36:25.396 A:middle
How frequently does it change?

00:36:26.016 --> 00:36:28.906 A:middle
Understanding this about the
data you use can help you pick

00:36:28.906 --> 00:36:32.246 A:middle
the right tools to make your
memory as adaptable as possible.

00:36:33.146 --> 00:36:36.996 A:middle
Together we can improve
the adaptivity of our apps

00:36:37.046 --> 00:36:39.586 A:middle
and provide the best
multitasking experience

00:36:39.586 --> 00:36:40.136 A:middle
for our users.

00:36:40.746 --> 00:36:43.956 A:middle
In the coming weeks, as
you're update your apps

00:36:44.026 --> 00:36:45.636 A:middle
for multitasking in iOS 9,

00:36:45.756 --> 00:36:47.546 A:middle
I hope you keep these
topics in mind.

00:36:48.486 --> 00:36:53.746 A:middle
First, using Instruments
to identify and fix bugs.

00:36:54.266 --> 00:36:55.236 A:middle
This is the easy stuff.

00:36:55.236 --> 00:36:57.646 A:middle
Your leaks, inefficient
data structures, algorithms,

00:36:57.856 --> 00:36:58.976 A:middle
abandoned memory, too.

00:36:59.336 --> 00:37:01.156 A:middle
Get that stuff fixed.



00:36:59.336 --> 00:37:01.156 A:middle
Get that stuff fixed.

00:37:01.156 --> 00:37:03.396 A:middle
Second, prioritize
your work appropriately

00:37:03.396 --> 00:37:04.656 A:middle
and don't block the main thread.

00:37:04.996 --> 00:37:06.906 A:middle
I don't know how many of
you caught the first session

00:37:06.906 --> 00:37:09.376 A:middle
in this series, but the system
may actually terminate you

00:37:09.376 --> 00:37:12.156 A:middle
for blocking the main
thread for too long.

00:37:12.156 --> 00:37:13.256 A:middle
It is best to understand

00:37:13.256 --> 00:37:15.086 A:middle
where your work should
go and put it there.

00:37:15.536 --> 00:37:18.686 A:middle
The third was identifying and
managing your working set,

00:37:18.926 --> 00:37:21.606 A:middle
and be aware that this
working set may change based

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:23.636 A:middle
on the application's
current executing context:

00:37:23.916 --> 00:37:26.816 A:middle
are you foreground, are you
background, are you a PiP?

00:37:27.036 --> 00:37:28.286 A:middle
Understand where
you are right now

00:37:28.286 --> 00:37:31.006 A:middle
because your working set
is likely not the same.

00:37:31.576 --> 00:37:34.526 A:middle
The fourth is to use caches and
response to memory warnings.

00:37:34.656 --> 00:37:39.216 A:middle
This is the basics for being
a good multitasking citizen.

00:37:39.626 --> 00:37:40.446 A:middle
Please respond to them.

00:37:42.376 --> 00:37:44.126 A:middle
Next, leverage the
virtual memory system,

00:37:44.126 --> 00:37:45.126 A:middle
which is what we talked about.

00:37:45.536 --> 00:37:47.756 A:middle
Understand the data
characteristics of your app,

00:37:47.756 --> 00:37:49.276 A:middle
and see if you can
leverage these tools

00:37:49.276 --> 00:37:52.476 A:middle
to let the system manage
your memory for you.

00:37:53.536 --> 00:37:56.116 A:middle
The last is that great
performance requires trade-offs.

00:37:56.606 --> 00:37:57.766 A:middle
Your apps have requirements.

00:37:57.886 --> 00:37:59.516 A:middle
The apps running next to
you have requirements.

00:37:59.576 --> 00:38:00.826 A:middle
The system has limitations.



00:37:59.576 --> 00:38:00.826 A:middle
The system has limitations.

00:38:01.996 --> 00:38:05.516 A:middle
Identify ways your app can
adapt to the environment

00:38:06.076 --> 00:38:08.486 A:middle
with more constrained
resources as this is the key

00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:11.396 A:middle
to improving the user
experience for everybody.

00:38:12.576 --> 00:38:14.846 A:middle
Because I started with a quote,
I'm going to end with one.

00:38:15.586 --> 00:38:16.736 A:middle
I found this on the Internet.

00:38:16.736 --> 00:38:19.896 A:middle
Allegedly attributed to Charles
Darwin: "It is not the strongest

00:38:20.186 --> 00:38:21.606 A:middle
or most intelligent who survive,

00:38:21.936 --> 00:38:23.606 A:middle
but those who can
best manage change."

00:38:24.266 --> 00:38:27.716 A:middle
Multitasking is about
adapting, and the apps

00:38:27.716 --> 00:38:30.466 A:middle
that best adapt are going

00:38:30.466 --> 00:38:32.146 A:middle
to provide the best
user experience.

00:38:33.696 --> 00:38:36.336 A:middle
For more information I
really encourage you to check

00:38:36.336 --> 00:38:37.636 A:middle
out the documentation.

00:38:37.636 --> 00:38:39.626 A:middle
There's a new Adopting
Multitasking guide

00:38:39.626 --> 00:38:40.216 A:middle
that is great.

00:38:40.726 --> 00:38:42.826 A:middle
Technical support,
come to the forums.

00:38:43.376 --> 00:38:44.756 A:middle
If you have any general
questions,

00:38:44.976 --> 00:38:47.476 A:middle
there's Curt Rothert,
contact him.

00:38:47.766 --> 00:38:49.616 A:middle
He's also an ex-SpringBoard
engineer, by the way,

00:38:49.616 --> 00:38:50.896 A:middle
so I'm sure he would
love to hear from you.

00:38:51.516 --> 00:38:53.966 A:middle
[Laughter]

00:38:54.466 --> 00:38:56.136 A:middle
We had two sessions
earlier in this track.

00:38:56.136 --> 00:38:57.556 A:middle
I encourage you to watch them.

00:38:57.696 --> 00:39:00.486 A:middle
There are also Performance
and GCD talks coming up.



00:38:57.696 --> 00:39:00.486 A:middle
There are also Performance
and GCD talks coming up.

00:39:01.336 --> 00:39:02.626 A:middle
Thank you, everybody,
for coming out!

00:39:03.296 --> 00:39:04.706 A:middle
I can't wait to see your apps!

00:39:05.508 --> 00:39:07.508 A:middle
[Applause]
