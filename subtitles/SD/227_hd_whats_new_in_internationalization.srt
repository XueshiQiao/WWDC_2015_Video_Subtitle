00:00:19.016 --> 00:00:20.046 A:middle
[Applause]

00:00:20.046 --> 00:00:20.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; NAT HILLARD: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:24.076 --> 00:00:26.596 A:middle
Now, good morning, or
should I say, zao an,

00:00:27.046 --> 00:00:28.916 A:middle
dobry den, buenas dias.

00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:30.276 A:middle
My name is Nat Hillard.

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:33.486 A:middle
Today I will be going over what
is new in internationalization.

00:00:34.026 --> 00:00:36.176 A:middle
I will be going over new
APIs that we have introduced,

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:39.156 A:middle
as well as improvements to
existing APIs that you can use

00:00:39.156 --> 00:00:41.796 A:middle
in your apps to make them ready
for use all around the world.

00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:45.276 A:middle
To begin with, this
is the Earth.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:48.506 A:middle
There are over 7 billion
people on this Earth.

00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:51.496 A:middle
To these 7 billion
people, Apple has sold

00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:54.486 A:middle
over 1 billion iOS devices.

00:00:54.976 --> 00:00:56.256 A:middle
Additionally, our install base

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:58.516 A:middle
for Mac OS X is 80
million devices.

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:02.956 A:middle
We have over 450 physical stores
located all around the world



00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:02.956 A:middle
We have over 450 physical stores
located all around the world

00:01:03.526 --> 00:01:06.756 A:middle
and your apps, numbering
1.4 million or more,

00:01:07.236 --> 00:01:09.096 A:middle
have gone from developers
just like you,

00:01:09.516 --> 00:01:11.106 A:middle
have gone to users
all around the world.

00:01:12.096 --> 00:01:16.126 A:middle
So, that's a lot of numbers, but
if you only take away one number

00:01:16.126 --> 00:01:18.046 A:middle
from today's presentation,
let it be this.

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:23.416 A:middle
69%. 69% of Apple's
current revenue comes

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:24.526 A:middle
from international markets.

00:01:24.836 --> 00:01:25.716 A:middle
Now this is huge.

00:01:25.716 --> 00:01:27.856 A:middle
To see this in perspective,
let's look at a graph.

00:01:28.806 --> 00:01:31.866 A:middle
Over two-thirds of Apple's
revenue is coming from places

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.026 A:middle
that are not the United States.

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:35.826 A:middle
Users in these areas have
different expectations

00:01:35.826 --> 00:01:37.556 A:middle
about how they'll
interact with your app.

00:01:37.756 --> 00:01:39.596 A:middle
These include linguistic
differences,

00:01:39.676 --> 00:01:41.576 A:middle
regional differences,
and cultural differences

00:01:41.576 --> 00:01:42.606 A:middle
that you will have
to keep in mind.

00:01:42.606 --> 00:01:44.596 A:middle
Now let's break this
down even more.

00:01:46.226 --> 00:01:49.456 A:middle
Interestingly, here,
is that a combined 41%

00:01:49.456 --> 00:01:51.466 A:middle
of your users are coming
from China and Japan.

00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:53.796 A:middle
Now, I think it's a
common misconception

00:01:53.796 --> 00:01:56.606 A:middle
that internationalizing your app
means making it work in Europe.

00:01:56.996 --> 00:02:00.096 A:middle
Now, indeed, this is important,
but additionally you have



00:01:56.996 --> 00:02:00.096 A:middle
Now, indeed, this is important,
but additionally you have

00:02:00.146 --> 00:02:01.616 A:middle
to keep in mind that
users in China

00:02:02.326 --> 00:02:04.216 A:middle
and Japan present
additional challenges.

00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:07.756 A:middle
That is to say, they don't
use an alphabetic script.

00:02:07.946 --> 00:02:09.636 A:middle
There are no spaces
to separate words.

00:02:09.636 --> 00:02:11.196 A:middle
And, additionally, what may work

00:02:11.196 --> 00:02:14.686 A:middle
in your UI will be often a lot
terser in Chinese and Japanese.

00:02:15.446 --> 00:02:16.486 A:middle
So, the good news, here,

00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:18.706 A:middle
is if you use our
APIs we will help you

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:21.796 A:middle
to internationalize your
app easily and effortlessly.

00:02:22.796 --> 00:02:25.166 A:middle
So, today we will be going
over four major areas

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:28.596 A:middle
that you'll have to think
about: localization, formatting,

00:02:29.056 --> 00:02:30.376 A:middle
handling text, and layout.

00:02:31.306 --> 00:02:35.616 A:middle
So, to begin with, let's
discuss localization.

00:02:36.746 --> 00:02:37.956 A:middle
Now, by localization, I mean

00:02:37.956 --> 00:02:40.776 A:middle
to say making your app speak
your customer's language.

00:02:41.356 --> 00:02:42.866 A:middle
I mean this both
literally, in the sense

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:44.626 A:middle
of translating the words
that appear on the screen,

00:02:44.916 --> 00:02:46.116 A:middle
as well as more metaphorically,

00:02:46.536 --> 00:02:49.016 A:middle
translating linguistic concepts
behind the things you wish

00:02:49.016 --> 00:02:49.506 A:middle
to translate.

00:02:50.546 --> 00:02:52.886 A:middle
So, it might be helpful
actually to begin this section

00:02:52.886 --> 00:02:55.486 A:middle
with taking a look at how users
interact with these settings

00:02:55.526 --> 00:02:58.306 A:middle
on our operating systems.

00:02:58.306 --> 00:03:01.146 A:middle
On the left, we have OS
X, on the right, iOS.



00:02:58.306 --> 00:03:01.146 A:middle
On the left, we have OS
X, on the right, iOS.

00:03:01.406 --> 00:03:03.036 A:middle
These are the language and
region preference panes.

00:03:03.626 --> 00:03:06.296 A:middle
So, on the left-hand side
here, on the OS X screenshot,

00:03:06.296 --> 00:03:07.786 A:middle
you will see the
preferred languages list.

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:09.446 A:middle
Now, in fact, it's
important here

00:03:09.446 --> 00:03:11.126 A:middle
that this is an ordered
list of languages.

00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:13.596 A:middle
Users can add multiple
languages and,

00:03:13.596 --> 00:03:15.626 A:middle
if a given language is not
available for the display

00:03:15.626 --> 00:03:18.006 A:middle
of your UI, it will
actually fall back

00:03:18.056 --> 00:03:18.856 A:middle
to the language below it.

00:03:19.706 --> 00:03:22.246 A:middle
Here, for instance, the
user has chosen Swiss German

00:03:22.246 --> 00:03:23.236 A:middle
as their primary language.

00:03:23.666 --> 00:03:25.196 A:middle
But Swiss German is,
in fact, not a language

00:03:25.196 --> 00:03:26.126 A:middle
that we localize into.

00:03:26.576 --> 00:03:28.686 A:middle
Therefore, for this UI, we
have fallen back to English.

00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:30.996 A:middle
Now, these fall backs are,
in fact, somewhat common,

00:03:31.046 --> 00:03:32.026 A:middle
so you will have
to think about this

00:03:32.026 --> 00:03:34.136 A:middle
from a developer
perspective as well.

00:03:34.296 --> 00:03:35.596 A:middle
So, in addition, though,

00:03:35.596 --> 00:03:37.496 A:middle
to the language your
app is displayed in,

00:03:37.866 --> 00:03:39.566 A:middle
we have additional
regional preferences.

00:03:40.476 --> 00:03:42.226 A:middle
These are off to the
right-hand side of OS X

00:03:42.226 --> 00:03:44.536 A:middle
and a little further down
on the iOS screenshot.

00:03:45.526 --> 00:03:48.366 A:middle
Now, these actually inform
the way the given units,

00:03:48.756 --> 00:03:51.216 A:middle
as well as times
and calendar dates,

00:03:51.246 --> 00:03:52.656 A:middle
display in a given locale.

00:03:53.556 --> 00:03:58.406 A:middle
So, that is to say that
it's not simply the language

00:03:58.406 --> 00:03:59.416 A:middle
that you are translating into,

00:03:59.686 --> 00:04:02.126 A:middle
but often the concepts
behind the things you wish



00:03:59.686 --> 00:04:02.126 A:middle
but often the concepts
behind the things you wish

00:04:02.126 --> 00:04:02.576 A:middle
to translate.

00:04:03.586 --> 00:04:05.576 A:middle
Now, for a lot more information
about the differences

00:04:05.576 --> 00:04:07.906 A:middle
between the preferred language
and the locale settings,

00:04:08.536 --> 00:04:10.506 A:middle
do check out last year's
talk, "Advanced Topics

00:04:10.506 --> 00:04:11.996 A:middle
in Internationalization,"
which goes

00:04:11.996 --> 00:04:13.136 A:middle
into a lot more detail
about this.

00:04:14.176 --> 00:04:16.846 A:middle
So, we provide a lot of
settings out of the box,

00:04:16.846 --> 00:04:19.236 A:middle
but we additionally allow users
to customize these settings

00:04:19.346 --> 00:04:21.026 A:middle
if they have individual
preferences.

00:04:21.685 --> 00:04:24.896 A:middle
So, new in iOS 9 and El
Capitan, we have the ability

00:04:24.896 --> 00:04:28.516 A:middle
to customize your number
system, as you can see here.

00:04:29.226 --> 00:04:31.796 A:middle
So let's say we have a user
who is an Urdu speaker.

00:04:32.396 --> 00:04:34.486 A:middle
They have chosen as their
primary language, Urdu,

00:04:34.556 --> 00:04:36.406 A:middle
and it has therefore
fallen back to English

00:04:37.356 --> 00:04:40.486 A:middle
in our operating
system display language.

00:04:41.216 --> 00:04:45.116 A:middle
By default this user would
receive the standard Arabic

00:04:45.116 --> 00:04:45.796 A:middle
style numerals.

00:04:47.466 --> 00:04:52.986 A:middle
We allow, though, in iOS 9
and OS X, El Capitan, to go in

00:04:52.986 --> 00:04:54.146 A:middle
and customize these settings

00:04:54.196 --> 00:04:56.086 A:middle
to override the existing
numeric system.

00:04:56.376 --> 00:04:57.916 A:middle
A lot of people don't
realize, in fact,

00:04:57.916 --> 00:04:59.836 A:middle
there are multiple numeric
systems in use around the world.



00:05:00.436 --> 00:05:02.026 A:middle
On the top we have
the Arabic system

00:05:02.086 --> 00:05:04.846 A:middle
and below we have the so-called
Perso-Arabic numeral system,

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:06.046 A:middle
commonly in use in
the Middle East.

00:05:06.646 --> 00:05:08.066 A:middle
So a user can choose
this setting,

00:05:08.486 --> 00:05:10.236 A:middle
and it has interesting
repercussions throughout the

00:05:10.236 --> 00:05:10.816 A:middle
operating system.

00:05:11.766 --> 00:05:13.516 A:middle
Here, for instance, we
have the Weather app.

00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:16.266 A:middle
Now, without any additional
changes on the part

00:05:16.266 --> 00:05:19.306 A:middle
of the developer, all they have
called is 'localized string

00:05:19.306 --> 00:05:22.816 A:middle
with format' or the NS
number formatter APIs;

00:05:22.816 --> 00:05:25.006 A:middle
they have gotten these
numeric changes for free.

00:05:25.626 --> 00:05:27.896 A:middle
On the left, we have a user
using the Arabic numeral system,

00:05:28.186 --> 00:05:29.946 A:middle
and on the right, the
Perso-Arabic numerals.

00:05:30.786 --> 00:05:32.466 A:middle
We noticed that every,
every instance

00:05:32.466 --> 00:05:36.556 A:middle
of Arabic numerals have changed
in this UI, including, in fact,

00:05:36.646 --> 00:05:38.106 A:middle
the timestamp at the
top of the screen.

00:05:39.456 --> 00:05:41.906 A:middle
So, this is interesting,
as a developer,

00:05:42.176 --> 00:05:43.266 A:middle
simply calling 'localized string

00:05:43.266 --> 00:05:44.876 A:middle
of format' you will get
this behavior for free.

00:05:45.866 --> 00:05:48.986 A:middle
Now, in addition to the
language that the user is seeing

00:05:48.986 --> 00:05:51.636 A:middle
on the screen, the user
is also inputting text

00:05:51.636 --> 00:05:52.536 A:middle
into your application.

00:05:54.056 --> 00:05:57.996 A:middle
New in iOS 9 we add five new
keyboards for Indic languages.

00:05:59.016 --> 00:06:01.106 A:middle
On the right, here, you
see the Telugu keyboard.



00:05:59.016 --> 00:06:01.106 A:middle
On the right, here, you
see the Telugu keyboard.

00:06:02.016 --> 00:06:04.626 A:middle
Now, additionally, we've
added predictive typing

00:06:04.626 --> 00:06:06.716 A:middle
for four existing
languages: Korean,

00:06:06.836 --> 00:06:08.586 A:middle
Mexican Spanish,
Russian, and Turkish.

00:06:09.596 --> 00:06:11.926 A:middle
Now, from a developer
perspective, it's interesting

00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:13.086 A:middle
to realize that, in fact,

00:06:13.086 --> 00:06:15.736 A:middle
often these characters are not
what we would typically call

00:06:15.736 --> 00:06:16.166 A:middle
a character.

00:06:16.726 --> 00:06:19.166 A:middle
Here in the Telugu keyboard we
have combining mark characters,

00:06:19.456 --> 00:06:21.276 A:middle
that, in fact, will combine
with other characters

00:06:21.276 --> 00:06:22.696 A:middle
to represent a single
visible unit.

00:06:23.596 --> 00:06:24.746 A:middle
So, we'll get into that
a little bit later.

00:06:26.226 --> 00:06:29.746 A:middle
Now, so, we have seen how
users can change the settings

00:06:29.746 --> 00:06:30.576 A:middle
on your operating system.

00:06:31.096 --> 00:06:33.846 A:middle
But, how then do localizers
translate the strings

00:06:33.916 --> 00:06:34.936 A:middle
that users are seeing?

00:06:35.816 --> 00:06:39.526 A:middle
The primary interface for
localizers is the .strings file.

00:06:40.236 --> 00:06:42.016 A:middle
The .strings file
has this format.

00:06:42.186 --> 00:06:45.406 A:middle
First you have a comment,
in C-style comment syntax,

00:06:45.756 --> 00:06:49.006 A:middle
followed by the development
language on the left-hand side,

00:06:49.006 --> 00:06:50.476 A:middle
and the target language
on the right.

00:06:51.056 --> 00:06:54.906 A:middle
Here we have a German.strings
file.

00:06:54.906 --> 00:06:57.116 A:middle
Now, .strings files are
stored in lproj directories

00:06:57.116 --> 00:06:59.546 A:middle
of your bundle, within
the resources directory.



00:07:00.176 --> 00:07:03.596 A:middle
English has its own .strings
files, as, here, does German.

00:07:04.416 --> 00:07:07.486 A:middle
Now, additionally, we allow
you, and we have allowed you

00:07:07.486 --> 00:07:09.976 A:middle
since XCode 6, to
export localizations

00:07:09.976 --> 00:07:12.136 A:middle
in the commonly used
XLIFF file format.

00:07:12.586 --> 00:07:15.536 A:middle
You can then re-import those as
strings files into your project.

00:07:16.036 --> 00:07:17.616 A:middle
But for a lot more
information about this,

00:07:17.616 --> 00:07:19.456 A:middle
I would encourage you to
check out last year's talk,

00:07:19.516 --> 00:07:21.106 A:middle
"Localizing with XCode 6."

00:07:22.206 --> 00:07:24.956 A:middle
So, we have seen how users
are changing these settings.

00:07:25.526 --> 00:07:28.576 A:middle
We have seen how localizers
can then translate the strings

00:07:28.576 --> 00:07:30.196 A:middle
that you see on your
screen, but, then,

00:07:30.356 --> 00:07:32.356 A:middle
how do you as a developer
make use of these settings?

00:07:34.066 --> 00:07:36.136 A:middle
Here's where NSLocalizedString
comes into play.

00:07:37.016 --> 00:07:38.836 A:middle
In Objective-C, this is a macro.

00:07:39.506 --> 00:07:41.936 A:middle
In Swift, we promoted this
to a first class function.

00:07:42.636 --> 00:07:45.246 A:middle
It takes five parameters, three
of which have default values.

00:07:45.776 --> 00:07:47.296 A:middle
Interestingly, in
Swift, we've made it

00:07:47.296 --> 00:07:49.836 A:middle
such that the comment
argument is non-optional.

00:07:50.606 --> 00:07:53.096 A:middle
This is really emphasizing
this is a critical argument.

00:07:53.136 --> 00:07:54.986 A:middle
It provides context
for your translators.

00:07:55.676 --> 00:07:58.486 A:middle
A given word may be
ambiguous in certain contexts

00:07:58.486 --> 00:08:01.736 A:middle
and this comment parameter will
allow you to customize that.



00:07:58.486 --> 00:08:01.736 A:middle
and this comment parameter will
allow you to customize that.

00:08:02.616 --> 00:08:04.866 A:middle
So, the key is the string
you wish to translate,

00:08:05.256 --> 00:08:07.266 A:middle
and the comment is the
comment explaining it.

00:08:07.876 --> 00:08:10.046 A:middle
Now, this works for simple
localized strings, but,

00:08:10.046 --> 00:08:12.006 A:middle
additionally, we allow
you to get a localized,

00:08:12.076 --> 00:08:13.976 A:middle
formatted string,
that is to say,

00:08:13.976 --> 00:08:16.116 A:middle
a string with variable
arguments to be populated.

00:08:16.966 --> 00:08:19.326 A:middle
So for that, you call
'localized string with format,

00:08:19.716 --> 00:08:24.276 A:middle
passing in a format string with
certain format arguments as well

00:08:24.276 --> 00:08:26.576 A:middle
as the arguments to populate the
variables within that string.

00:08:26.576 --> 00:08:29.936 A:middle
And in fact, it's actually very
common to use these together.

00:08:30.456 --> 00:08:32.566 A:middle
You call 'localized string
with format' on the result

00:08:32.566 --> 00:08:34.456 A:middle
of having called
NSLocalizedString.

00:08:36.046 --> 00:08:37.525 A:middle
Now, to see what this
looks like in action,

00:08:37.525 --> 00:08:42.196 A:middle
it might be helpful
to give a brief demo.

00:08:42.905 --> 00:08:46.446 A:middle
So, let's say we wish to
translate the string location:X.

00:08:47.056 --> 00:08:49.406 A:middle
Now, let's also say that
we have a variable location

00:08:49.406 --> 00:08:50.966 A:middle
which has been populated
by our translators

00:08:51.206 --> 00:08:52.766 A:middle
to be the user's
physical location.

00:08:54.086 --> 00:08:55.506 A:middle
Here is what our strings
files may look like.

00:08:56.056 --> 00:08:58.506 A:middle
On the left-hand side is
the string to be translated,

00:08:58.506 --> 00:09:00.036 A:middle
and on the right is
the translated variant.



00:08:58.506 --> 00:09:00.036 A:middle
and on the right is
the translated variant.

00:09:01.146 --> 00:09:03.316 A:middle
We see here that in fact the
translated variant still has a

00:09:03.316 --> 00:09:04.006 A:middle
variable string.

00:09:04.496 --> 00:09:06.536 A:middle
Percent add is meant to be
filled with a string variable.

00:09:07.766 --> 00:09:11.296 A:middle
So, this works in English -- we
have location, San Francisco --

00:09:11.806 --> 00:09:12.756 A:middle
as well as in Japanese.

00:09:13.196 --> 00:09:14.186 A:middle
This is the equivalent string.

00:09:15.446 --> 00:09:17.416 A:middle
So, now that you know this,

00:09:18.236 --> 00:09:19.706 A:middle
you may have some
certain assumptions

00:09:19.706 --> 00:09:20.336 A:middle
that come into your head.

00:09:21.196 --> 00:09:24.216 A:middle
One being that the arguments as
presented to 'localized string

00:09:24.216 --> 00:09:27.076 A:middle
with format' will be in the same
order that they are in English.

00:09:27.926 --> 00:09:29.286 A:middle
Now, we will see
why this is wrong.

00:09:29.726 --> 00:09:32.356 A:middle
We call 'localized
string with format' here

00:09:32.356 --> 00:09:33.896 A:middle
on the result of
NSLocalizedString.

00:09:34.026 --> 00:09:36.826 A:middle
We wish to translate
the string 'copy X is Y'

00:09:37.196 --> 00:09:39.656 A:middle
where X is the user name and Y
is the thing we wish to copy.

00:09:40.436 --> 00:09:41.926 A:middle
Here, we're passing
"hairForce1,"

00:09:42.546 --> 00:09:44.786 A:middle
which is Craig Federighi's
chosen InstaMessage handle,

00:09:45.316 --> 00:09:46.066 A:middle
and "photos."

00:09:46.616 --> 00:09:49.196 A:middle
In our lproj, in
our .strings files

00:09:49.196 --> 00:09:52.136 A:middle
within our different lprojs,
a developer may assume

00:09:52.136 --> 00:09:53.926 A:middle
that the arguments will
appear in the same order.

00:09:54.756 --> 00:09:55.896 A:middle
While this may work for English,

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:57.926 A:middle
in fact it doesn't
work for German.

00:09:59.176 --> 00:10:01.236 A:middle
These arguments need
to be reversed



00:09:59.176 --> 00:10:01.236 A:middle
These arguments need
to be reversed

00:10:01.276 --> 00:10:02.176 A:middle
to make sense in German.

00:10:02.916 --> 00:10:05.006 A:middle
So, here is where a
localizer can actually go in

00:10:05.416 --> 00:10:07.476 A:middle
and add these positional
formatting arguments.

00:10:07.756 --> 00:10:09.636 A:middle
This allows what was
formerly the second argument

00:10:09.716 --> 00:10:11.236 A:middle
to become the first,
and vice versa.

00:10:12.136 --> 00:10:17.046 A:middle
So, here, then, a developer
doesn't have to do anything.

00:10:17.276 --> 00:10:19.696 A:middle
They call 'localized string with
format' and NSLocalizedString.

00:10:20.326 --> 00:10:22.066 A:middle
But, it's important
to keep in mind

00:10:22.066 --> 00:10:23.566 A:middle
from a developer perspective

00:10:23.596 --> 00:10:26.676 A:middle
that what you think may be the
first character may not be.

00:10:27.206 --> 00:10:29.766 A:middle
So if you have an operation
that operates on the assumption

00:10:29.766 --> 00:10:32.076 A:middle
that the arguments will come in
in the same order, you may want

00:10:32.156 --> 00:10:33.266 A:middle
to rethink that assumption.

00:10:34.906 --> 00:10:38.836 A:middle
So, now we know how the
.strings files are stored and in

00:10:38.836 --> 00:10:39.906 A:middle
which directories
they're stored.

00:10:40.616 --> 00:10:43.466 A:middle
But at this point
you may be tempted

00:10:43.466 --> 00:10:45.356 A:middle
to do something like this.

00:10:45.656 --> 00:10:47.776 A:middle
You set the language
variable to the first object

00:10:47.776 --> 00:10:49.006 A:middle
in your preferred
language's array.

00:10:49.526 --> 00:10:51.576 A:middle
This corresponds to the
UI element we saw before,

00:10:51.576 --> 00:10:52.746 A:middle
the preferredLanguages list.

00:10:53.446 --> 00:10:56.986 A:middle
Additionally, you append
the suffix lproj to this,

00:10:57.316 --> 00:10:58.726 A:middle
and you call a 'path
for resource.'

00:10:58.966 --> 00:11:02.856 A:middle
Let's say we wish to
localize a stop sign graphic.



00:10:58.966 --> 00:11:02.856 A:middle
Let's say we wish to
localize a stop sign graphic.

00:11:03.726 --> 00:11:05.776 A:middle
So, here, let's say, though,

00:11:05.776 --> 00:11:09.456 A:middle
that our individual bundle
only has an es.lproj,

00:11:09.456 --> 00:11:10.376 A:middle
corresponding to Spanish.

00:11:11.006 --> 00:11:12.826 A:middle
But let's say our user's
preferred language is

00:11:12.826 --> 00:11:13.646 A:middle
Mexican Spanish.

00:11:14.296 --> 00:11:18.056 A:middle
Using this particular technique,
the user will get nothing back.

00:11:18.576 --> 00:11:19.646 A:middle
Now, why is this?

00:11:20.126 --> 00:11:22.286 A:middle
Well, it's because we are
not using the standard

00:11:22.286 --> 00:11:23.346 A:middle
NSBundle APIs.

00:11:23.846 --> 00:11:26.376 A:middle
NSBundle will intelligently
fall back

00:11:26.746 --> 00:11:29.946 A:middle
to an available localization if
one is not currently available.

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:32.496 A:middle
So es-MX will fall back to es.

00:11:33.186 --> 00:11:35.706 A:middle
Additionally, we have other
smart, fall back logics,

00:11:35.706 --> 00:11:39.026 A:middle
such as en-IN, Indian
English, falling back to en-GB,

00:11:39.076 --> 00:11:42.216 A:middle
the English as used
in the United Kingdom.

00:11:42.986 --> 00:11:46.996 A:middle
So if you call, if
you call these APIs,

00:11:47.516 --> 00:11:49.776 A:middle
you will get back the
appropriate resource

00:11:50.166 --> 00:11:51.336 A:middle
with the appropriate fall backs.

00:11:51.646 --> 00:11:53.196 A:middle
'Image for resource'
will give you the image.

00:11:53.666 --> 00:11:55.816 A:middle
'Path for sound resource' will
give you the sound resource.

00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:57.416 A:middle
And 'URL for resource,'
the most generic,

00:11:57.846 --> 00:12:00.196 A:middle
will give you back any
given other file format.



00:11:57.846 --> 00:12:00.196 A:middle
will give you back any
given other file format.

00:12:01.526 --> 00:12:05.116 A:middle
So, we are seeing, here, using
NSBundle APIs makes it easy

00:12:05.116 --> 00:12:06.606 A:middle
to find the resources
you are interested in.

00:12:07.426 --> 00:12:10.056 A:middle
And, additionally,
however, you may think

00:12:10.056 --> 00:12:12.496 A:middle
that there are certain things
that can only be done in code.

00:12:13.586 --> 00:12:15.216 A:middle
Now, how many of you have
written code like this?

00:12:15.716 --> 00:12:16.876 A:middle
You wish to say, you wish

00:12:16.876 --> 00:12:19.176 A:middle
to translate the string
'X days remaining.'

00:12:19.816 --> 00:12:22.146 A:middle
We know that in English, if
there is only a single day,

00:12:22.436 --> 00:12:24.656 A:middle
we use 'X day remaining,'
and if there are two

00:12:24.656 --> 00:12:26.586 A:middle
or more we say 'blank
days remaining.'

00:12:27.356 --> 00:12:28.746 A:middle
Now, this may work in English.

00:12:28.866 --> 00:12:30.546 A:middle
It works for one
day and five days.

00:12:31.046 --> 00:12:33.736 A:middle
But other languages
don't have the same logic

00:12:34.106 --> 00:12:37.046 A:middle
about how things are pluralized,
given a given numeric component.

00:12:37.766 --> 00:12:41.026 A:middle
Here in Russian, for instance,
we only have, we have one form

00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:44.246 A:middle
for one, we also have
a form for few, many,

00:12:44.246 --> 00:12:45.316 A:middle
and even more than many.

00:12:46.236 --> 00:12:48.726 A:middle
So this simply doesn't
work for languages

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:50.236 A:middle
that have different
pluralization rules.

00:12:50.986 --> 00:12:51.846 A:middle
Now, to help you with this,

00:12:52.446 --> 00:12:53.946 A:middle
we provide the string
stick mechanism.

00:12:54.146 --> 00:12:55.726 A:middle
This has been around
for a few releases

00:12:56.126 --> 00:12:57.466 A:middle
but it's important
to emphasize here.

00:12:58.576 --> 00:13:01.826 A:middle
A string stick file is
essentially a plist file



00:12:58.576 --> 00:13:01.826 A:middle
A string stick file is
essentially a plist file

00:13:01.886 --> 00:13:03.046 A:middle
that you store within
your project.

00:13:03.486 --> 00:13:04.746 A:middle
It's a localized resource,

00:13:04.746 --> 00:13:06.556 A:middle
so it falls within
your lproj directory

00:13:06.866 --> 00:13:08.336 A:middle
for a given localization.

00:13:09.026 --> 00:13:10.696 A:middle
As well, you have a given key.

00:13:10.916 --> 00:13:12.936 A:middle
That key, in conjunction
with a numeric argument,

00:13:13.296 --> 00:13:15.696 A:middle
will then have different
realizations, depending on what

00:13:15.696 --> 00:13:16.806 A:middle
that numeric argument is.

00:13:17.506 --> 00:13:18.856 A:middle
I realize this is a lot of text,

00:13:18.896 --> 00:13:21.536 A:middle
especially when you add
the Russian component here.

00:13:23.546 --> 00:13:27.216 A:middle
But, that is to say, you know
English has one form for one

00:13:27.356 --> 00:13:29.936 A:middle
and a different form for
other, whereas Russian

00:13:29.986 --> 00:13:31.466 A:middle
as one, few, many, and other.

00:13:32.256 --> 00:13:34.806 A:middle
Now, to format string stick
files I would really encourage

00:13:34.806 --> 00:13:36.236 A:middle
you to check out the
"Internationalization

00:13:36.236 --> 00:13:37.186 A:middle
and Localization Guide."

00:13:37.596 --> 00:13:39.506 A:middle
This goes into a lot more
detail than we can provide here

00:13:40.206 --> 00:13:42.316 A:middle
as to how to format and create
these files on your own.

00:13:43.436 --> 00:13:46.026 A:middle
So, using this is
in fact super easy

00:13:46.026 --> 00:13:47.046 A:middle
from a developer perspective.

00:13:47.976 --> 00:13:50.046 A:middle
Again, all you call is a
'localized string with format'

00:13:50.136 --> 00:13:51.636 A:middle
on the result of
NSLocalizedString.

00:13:52.336 --> 00:13:54.036 A:middle
The string that you are
passing in is the key

00:13:54.036 --> 00:13:55.126 A:middle
to the string stick dictionary.

00:13:56.116 --> 00:13:59.366 A:middle
Then you pass a numeric argument
which will fill in the variable,

00:13:59.366 --> 00:14:04.746 A:middle
from the formatted string
which has been returned to you.



00:13:59.366 --> 00:14:04.746 A:middle
from the formatted string
which has been returned to you.

00:14:05.116 --> 00:14:07.786 A:middle
Therefore, it will do the right
thing for English, for one, two,

00:14:07.786 --> 00:14:09.816 A:middle
and five days, as
well as for Russian.

00:14:10.186 --> 00:14:11.646 A:middle
We note here that
the form for two

00:14:11.646 --> 00:14:12.986 A:middle
and five is different
in Russian.

00:14:14.726 --> 00:14:16.866 A:middle
So, more on the topic
of string stick.

00:14:17.696 --> 00:14:21.806 A:middle
We have a new mechanism in
iOS 9 to allow you to make use

00:14:21.806 --> 00:14:24.006 A:middle
of string stick for formatting
strings on the screen.

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:27.726 A:middle
It's also in El Capitan,
I should say.

00:14:27.726 --> 00:14:31.176 A:middle
So, to begin that, let's say,
this is a common problem,

00:14:31.176 --> 00:14:34.236 A:middle
and in your InterfaceBuilder you
have set up a string to appear

00:14:34.236 --> 00:14:36.506 A:middle
in the center of your screen:
"Welcome to the store!"

00:14:37.386 --> 00:14:42.226 A:middle
This may work on an iPad Air,
but it may not work as well

00:14:42.226 --> 00:14:45.546 A:middle
on an iPhone 6, and it may work
even worse on an iPod Touch.

00:14:45.886 --> 00:14:48.406 A:middle
Now, one way to solve this
is in fact using auto layout

00:14:48.446 --> 00:14:49.426 A:middle
and certain constraints.

00:14:49.426 --> 00:14:51.026 A:middle
And, often, that's the
solution to this problem.

00:14:51.026 --> 00:14:51.776 A:middle
We'll get into that later.

00:14:52.336 --> 00:14:54.946 A:middle
But in fact, another
way to solve this is

00:14:54.946 --> 00:14:58.456 A:middle
by using a new mechanism,
'variable width rule type.'

00:14:59.116 --> 00:15:01.006 A:middle
This is an entry you can
add within your string stick



00:14:59.116 --> 00:15:01.006 A:middle
This is an entry you can
add within your string stick

00:15:01.006 --> 00:15:03.146 A:middle
which will provide different
realizations depending

00:15:03.146 --> 00:15:05.316 A:middle
on the amount of space
available to you.

00:15:06.126 --> 00:15:09.746 A:middle
On iOS, this refers to the M
width available on the screen,

00:15:10.146 --> 00:15:12.806 A:middle
that is to say, the
visible width of a capital M

00:15:12.806 --> 00:15:13.906 A:middle
in the standard system font.

00:15:14.716 --> 00:15:16.576 A:middle
We have three different
goal posts here.

00:15:17.076 --> 00:15:19.106 A:middle
We define if there
are 20Ms available,

00:15:19.566 --> 00:15:21.606 A:middle
we present the string "Hi."

00:15:21.606 --> 00:15:23.566 A:middle
If they are 25, we
give "Welcome."

00:15:23.566 --> 00:15:25.396 A:middle
And if there are 50, we
say, "Welcome to the store!"

00:15:26.396 --> 00:15:28.836 A:middle
To use this, again as the
developer, super easy.

00:15:29.266 --> 00:15:32.986 A:middle
You call NSLocalizedString
on the key

00:15:32.986 --> 00:15:34.116 A:middle
within your string stick file.

00:15:34.576 --> 00:15:36.376 A:middle
Then you set it to
a UI label object.

00:15:37.946 --> 00:15:42.086 A:middle
This works on iPad Air,
iPhone 6, and iPod Touch,

00:15:42.376 --> 00:15:43.736 A:middle
and the realization
is different.

00:15:44.256 --> 00:15:46.656 A:middle
Now, interestingly, we have
used English for these examples

00:15:47.056 --> 00:15:49.106 A:middle
but in fact this has
important repercussions

00:15:49.106 --> 00:15:50.696 A:middle
for international users as well.

00:15:51.236 --> 00:15:53.926 A:middle
Often a translation into another
language will be much longer

00:15:54.026 --> 00:15:54.746 A:middle
than that in English.

00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:56.786 A:middle
So this allows you
to flexibly choose

00:15:56.786 --> 00:15:58.826 A:middle
from among different
translations for a given string

00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:01.876 A:middle
in a different language as well,
so this is a super useful tool.



00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:01.876 A:middle
in a different language as well,
so this is a super useful tool.

00:16:03.536 --> 00:16:08.806 A:middle
On OS X, things are a
little bit different.

00:16:08.806 --> 00:16:13.526 A:middle
So, on OS X, likewise, you call
NSLocalizedString and you pass

00:16:13.526 --> 00:16:15.026 A:middle
in the key to your
string stick dictionary.

00:16:15.716 --> 00:16:18.086 A:middle
Then you call 'variant
fitting presentation width.'

00:16:18.696 --> 00:16:21.856 A:middle
Now, on OS X, this
integer variable is

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:24.626 A:middle
in fact an arbitrary quantity.

00:16:25.036 --> 00:16:27.076 A:middle
This can be anything, as
long as it's defined relative

00:16:27.076 --> 00:16:29.696 A:middle
to other quantities
within the string stick.

00:16:29.696 --> 00:16:36.226 A:middle
So calling this with an integer
value of 20 will yield "Hi," 25,

00:16:36.256 --> 00:16:38.306 A:middle
"Welcome," and 50,
"Welcome to the store!"

00:16:39.096 --> 00:16:42.206 A:middle
So, in general then we have
made it a lot easier for you

00:16:42.206 --> 00:16:44.346 A:middle
to translate strings as
they appear on the screen

00:16:44.696 --> 00:16:46.196 A:middle
in a flexible manner
that works for all

00:16:46.196 --> 00:16:46.886 A:middle
of the world's languages.

00:16:48.496 --> 00:16:50.736 A:middle
Next up, let's discuss
formatting.

00:16:51.516 --> 00:16:53.656 A:middle
It's often not enough to
simply translate the strings

00:16:53.656 --> 00:16:54.566 A:middle
that appear on your screen.

00:16:55.116 --> 00:16:57.326 A:middle
Additionally, you will have
to think about the way dates,

00:16:57.556 --> 00:17:01.726 A:middle
numbers, times, and, new in
iOS 9 and El Capitan, names.



00:16:57.556 --> 00:17:01.726 A:middle
numbers, times, and, new in
iOS 9 and El Capitan, names.

00:17:02.756 --> 00:17:05.266 A:middle
So, to begin with,
there is a right way

00:17:05.266 --> 00:17:06.826 A:middle
and a wrong way to
format numbers.

00:17:07.276 --> 00:17:09.435 A:middle
Let's say we wish to present
the constant pi to our users.

00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:11.766 A:middle
One naive way to
do this would be

00:17:11.766 --> 00:17:13.415 A:middle
to initialize a string variable

00:17:13.536 --> 00:17:17.606 A:middle
with a format argument
percent.3F, that is to say,

00:17:17.606 --> 00:17:20.386 A:middle
a 3 precision float argument.

00:17:20.796 --> 00:17:22.866 A:middle
This works in English, 3.142.

00:17:24.286 --> 00:17:26.566 A:middle
If you translate, if
your user is running

00:17:26.566 --> 00:17:27.906 A:middle
in a German localization,
however,

00:17:28.455 --> 00:17:30.536 A:middle
they get back this string.

00:17:30.536 --> 00:17:32.366 A:middle
This may appear correct
at first glance,

00:17:32.836 --> 00:17:36.296 A:middle
but in fact a German user
would read this 3,142,

00:17:36.726 --> 00:17:39.696 A:middle
because in German, the
decimals digit and the, sorry,

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.346 A:middle
the thousands digit and the
decimals digit are, in fact,

00:17:42.346 --> 00:17:44.736 A:middle
switched, so that is to say,
where we would use a period

00:17:45.026 --> 00:17:47.306 A:middle
in U.S. English, they use
a comma, and vice versa.

00:17:48.186 --> 00:17:49.606 A:middle
So, to take advantage
of this fact,

00:17:50.036 --> 00:17:52.096 A:middle
you can call 'localized
string with format,

00:17:52.366 --> 00:17:54.406 A:middle
passing in the same format
argument you used before.

00:17:55.226 --> 00:17:57.066 A:middle
Now this will have different
realizations depending

00:17:57.066 --> 00:17:57.916 A:middle
on a user's locale.

00:17:58.526 --> 00:18:00.386 A:middle
And this means now
the same thing



00:17:58.526 --> 00:18:00.386 A:middle
And this means now
the same thing

00:18:00.386 --> 00:18:02.046 A:middle
for an English user
and a German user.

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.576 A:middle
Now, under the hood,
'localized string

00:18:04.576 --> 00:18:06.536 A:middle
with format' is using
NS number formatter.

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:10.796 A:middle
And we have some improvements
to NS number formatter we would

00:18:10.796 --> 00:18:11.766 A:middle
like to discuss as well.

00:18:12.576 --> 00:18:16.986 A:middle
New in iOS 9 and El Capitan
are different number styles

00:18:16.986 --> 00:18:18.076 A:middle
for the NS number formatter.

00:18:18.526 --> 00:18:20.466 A:middle
In addition to the already
existing 'currency style,

00:18:20.826 --> 00:18:22.586 A:middle
we now have 'currency
ISO code style,

00:18:23.116 --> 00:18:26.546 A:middle
as well 'currency plural style'
and 'currency accounting style.'

00:18:27.296 --> 00:18:29.126 A:middle
Interestingly here for
'currency accounting style,

00:18:29.206 --> 00:18:31.106 A:middle
if you pass it a
negative number,

00:18:31.596 --> 00:18:33.716 A:middle
it presents it surrounded
by parentheses.

00:18:34.076 --> 00:18:35.416 A:middle
This is common in
accounting circles.

00:18:36.736 --> 00:18:39.766 A:middle
As well, we added an 'ordinal
style,' that is to say,

00:18:39.766 --> 00:18:41.696 A:middle
how the number would
appear in an ordered list.

00:18:42.136 --> 00:18:44.236 A:middle
So from 42, you get back 42nd.

00:18:45.456 --> 00:18:49.446 A:middle
So, in addition to formatting
numbers, another thing

00:18:49.446 --> 00:18:51.856 A:middle
that commonly goes wrong
is formatting dates.

00:18:51.856 --> 00:18:54.146 A:middle
Now here is a very naive
way to format a date.

00:18:54.756 --> 00:18:57.246 A:middle
We initialize an NS String
with this format argument.

00:18:57.726 --> 00:19:01.606 A:middle
That is to say, this
represents today's date at 9:00



00:18:57.726 --> 00:19:01.606 A:middle
That is to say, this
represents today's date at 9:00

00:19:01.606 --> 00:19:03.706 A:middle
in the morning to a
U.S. English speaker.

00:19:04.976 --> 00:19:07.266 A:middle
So in U.S. English we
would get back this string,

00:19:07.266 --> 00:19:08.836 A:middle
which looks appropriate
and correct.

00:19:09.286 --> 00:19:12.276 A:middle
But for an Italian user we
get back the same string.

00:19:12.846 --> 00:19:14.336 A:middle
Now this means something
very different in Italy.

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:18.996 A:middle
This is in fact the 6th day of
the 12th month, and furthermore,

00:19:18.996 --> 00:19:20.906 A:middle
the time itself could be
a little more clarified.

00:19:20.946 --> 00:19:21.796 A:middle
We'll get to that in a second.

00:19:22.166 --> 00:19:25.786 A:middle
So, one way you could
attempt to solve this is

00:19:25.786 --> 00:19:27.176 A:middle
by creating an NS
date formatter.

00:19:27.506 --> 00:19:29.466 A:middle
Indeed, NS date formatter
is the correct solution,

00:19:29.466 --> 00:19:30.926 A:middle
but this is the incorrect
way to use it.

00:19:31.566 --> 00:19:33.306 A:middle
Here, we're setting a
date format argument.

00:19:33.426 --> 00:19:37.316 A:middle
Now, the date format implies an
explicit ordering of strings.

00:19:37.736 --> 00:19:40.536 A:middle
The exact variables that you
provided here will then be

00:19:40.536 --> 00:19:45.156 A:middle
expanded in whatever locale you
are using, to the exact sequence

00:19:45.156 --> 00:19:45.956 A:middle
of characters you see.

00:19:46.546 --> 00:19:49.306 A:middle
So, again, we are getting back
the incorrect string in Italy.

00:19:50.226 --> 00:19:52.006 A:middle
Now, the easiest way
to fix this is in fact

00:19:52.006 --> 00:19:54.026 A:middle
by setting a date
style and a time style

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:55.216 A:middle
on your NS date formatter.

00:19:55.896 --> 00:19:58.456 A:middle
We provide certain out of the
box styles for NS date formatter

00:19:58.456 --> 00:20:02.376 A:middle
that allow you to specify
the amount of space available



00:19:58.456 --> 00:20:02.376 A:middle
that allow you to specify
the amount of space available

00:20:02.376 --> 00:20:04.386 A:middle
to you relative to the
width of the string.

00:20:05.176 --> 00:20:07.566 A:middle
So here we call, here
we set ShortStyle

00:20:07.846 --> 00:20:09.086 A:middle
for both date and time style.

00:20:09.786 --> 00:20:12.926 A:middle
What we get back in Italy,
therefore, is the same string

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:15.736 A:middle
but with the variables flipped.

00:20:16.226 --> 00:20:19.406 A:middle
So that is to say, this
now reads the 12th day

00:20:19.406 --> 00:20:21.456 A:middle
of the 6th month
to a user in Italy,

00:20:21.926 --> 00:20:24.166 A:middle
which is the same thing would
read as an English-US user.

00:20:25.136 --> 00:20:26.896 A:middle
Now, sometimes, though,
these date styles

00:20:26.896 --> 00:20:28.466 A:middle
and time styles aren't
as specific

00:20:28.466 --> 00:20:29.456 A:middle
as you may need them to be.

00:20:30.086 --> 00:20:33.256 A:middle
For that, new in iOS 9 and
El Capitan, we allow you

00:20:33.296 --> 00:20:35.686 A:middle
to set 'localized date
format from template.'

00:20:36.596 --> 00:20:40.266 A:middle
Here you provide a template and
the variables are rearranged

00:20:40.406 --> 00:20:41.986 A:middle
as appropriate for
your given locale.

00:20:43.036 --> 00:20:45.086 A:middle
Now this is when the
individual styles

00:20:45.086 --> 00:20:46.756 A:middle
out of the box don't
provide enough information.

00:20:47.116 --> 00:20:48.436 A:middle
Here, for instance,
the user wishes

00:20:48.476 --> 00:20:50.686 A:middle
to present the second
string as well,

00:20:51.086 --> 00:20:53.266 A:middle
which doesn't typically
come with a short style.

00:20:54.406 --> 00:20:57.546 A:middle
So using this template, we
have allowed for 24-hour time

00:20:57.546 --> 00:21:03.636 A:middle
as well, as well as rearranging
the month and day arguments.



00:20:57.546 --> 00:21:03.636 A:middle
as well, as well as rearranging
the month and day arguments.

00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:07.076 A:middle
So, we have looked at how
you can format numbers,

00:21:07.156 --> 00:21:08.096 A:middle
how you can format dates,

00:21:08.486 --> 00:21:10.426 A:middle
but also important is
how you format units.

00:21:12.186 --> 00:21:15.476 A:middle
Now, this is in fact a
very naive example but one

00:21:15.476 --> 00:21:17.586 A:middle
which is very real and we
have seen in the real world.

00:21:18.216 --> 00:21:19.716 A:middle
Let's say you wish to
translate the quantity

00:21:19.716 --> 00:21:21.866 A:middle
"6 pounds" to another language.

00:21:22.586 --> 00:21:24.616 A:middle
One very naive way to
solve this would be in fact

00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:26.166 A:middle
to literally translate
the string.

00:21:26.646 --> 00:21:28.616 A:middle
You have on the left-hand
side, "X pounds.'

00:21:28.976 --> 00:21:31.666 A:middle
We have translated this for an
Italian user to "X chilogrammi,"

00:21:31.666 --> 00:21:34.926 A:middle
that is to say the Italian
word for the word 'kilogram.'

00:21:35.636 --> 00:21:37.856 A:middle
Now, this may be
obviously very wrong.

00:21:37.856 --> 00:21:38.956 A:middle
In English we have 6 pounds.

00:21:38.956 --> 00:21:39.796 A:middle
In Italian we have 6 kilograms.

00:21:39.796 --> 00:21:40.456 A:middle
These quantities are not equal.

00:21:40.456 --> 00:21:41.996 A:middle
6 pounds is not equal
to 6 kilograms.

00:21:41.996 --> 00:21:43.956 A:middle
These quantities are
not, in fact, equal.

00:21:43.956 --> 00:21:47.016 A:middle
6 pounds as a unit is
not equal to 6 kilograms.

00:21:47.016 --> 00:21:48.916 A:middle
So this is a very
wrong way to do this.

00:21:49.686 --> 00:21:52.236 A:middle
An easier way is to
use NSMassFormatter.

00:21:52.696 --> 00:21:55.486 A:middle
Now, NSMassFormatter, as
well as NSEnergyFormatter

00:21:55.796 --> 00:21:57.836 A:middle
and LengthFormatter, assume

00:21:57.836 --> 00:22:00.116 A:middle
that under the hood you are
working in metric units.



00:21:57.836 --> 00:22:00.116 A:middle
that under the hood you are
working in metric units.

00:22:00.546 --> 00:22:03.606 A:middle
So when you assign a float
here to the variable weight,

00:22:03.606 --> 00:22:05.536 A:middle
it assumes that you are
working with kilograms.

00:22:06.196 --> 00:22:08.156 A:middle
So you initialize
an NSMassFormatter,

00:22:08.566 --> 00:22:11.016 A:middle
you set its unitStyle to
long, and then, furthermore,

00:22:11.016 --> 00:22:14.846 A:middle
you call 'string from kilograms'
on the weight in kilograms.

00:22:15.506 --> 00:22:18.406 A:middle
This will return back
in English 44.092,

00:22:19.306 --> 00:22:21.056 A:middle
which is in fact a
conversion of the units

00:22:21.346 --> 00:22:22.776 A:middle
into those used in
the United States.

00:22:23.676 --> 00:22:26.046 A:middle
Furthermore, in Italian you
will get back 20 chilogrammi

00:22:26.366 --> 00:22:28.946 A:middle
which is both the
correct unit as well

00:22:28.946 --> 00:22:31.026 A:middle
as the correct translated
term for the amount of weight

00:22:31.026 --> 00:22:31.576 A:middle
that you are providing.

00:22:32.346 --> 00:22:35.236 A:middle
So using NSMassFormatter
makes it super easy to present

00:22:35.236 --> 00:22:36.296 A:middle
in units for your user.

00:22:37.236 --> 00:22:40.336 A:middle
Now, new in iOS 9, we allow you

00:22:40.336 --> 00:22:43.706 A:middle
to format names --
iOS 9 and El Capitan.

00:22:44.396 --> 00:22:46.916 A:middle
Now, to see why this is
useful, let's take a look

00:22:46.916 --> 00:22:47.926 A:middle
at two names side by side.

00:22:48.346 --> 00:22:50.636 A:middle
The first is "Grace
Murray Hopper."

00:22:51.066 --> 00:22:52.376 A:middle
This is a famous
computer scientist

00:22:52.376 --> 00:22:52.986 A:middle
from the United States.

00:22:52.986 --> 00:22:56.726 A:middle
She coined the term "bug" and
invented the first compiler.

00:22:57.496 --> 00:23:00.426 A:middle
Additionally, let's look at a
Chinese name, "Wang Dongling."



00:22:57.496 --> 00:23:00.426 A:middle
Additionally, let's look at a
Chinese name, "Wang Dongling."

00:23:01.096 --> 00:23:02.606 A:middle
Now, this is a famous
calligrapher,

00:23:02.726 --> 00:23:04.816 A:middle
who does the calligraphy outside
of the Hangzhou Apple Store.

00:23:05.526 --> 00:23:07.426 A:middle
So, both of these have
three parts to them.

00:23:08.016 --> 00:23:10.486 A:middle
But the way we interpret them
is important and different.

00:23:11.886 --> 00:23:14.746 A:middle
In English we would
typically call this the first,

00:23:14.916 --> 00:23:16.326 A:middle
the middle, and the last name.

00:23:16.546 --> 00:23:18.466 A:middle
We will see what
happens when we attempt

00:23:18.466 --> 00:23:20.996 A:middle
to apply this concept
for a Chinese user.

00:23:21.076 --> 00:23:25.876 A:middle
What was formerly the last name
is now, spatially speaking,

00:23:25.876 --> 00:23:26.836 A:middle
first from left to right.

00:23:27.556 --> 00:23:29.706 A:middle
The middle name itself
doesn't exist at all.

00:23:29.706 --> 00:23:32.976 A:middle
And what's formerly the first
name is now, spatially speaking

00:23:33.066 --> 00:23:37.786 A:middle
from left to right,
the last name.

00:23:38.366 --> 00:23:41.716 A:middle
So, we can see here that
terminology is important as well

00:23:41.716 --> 00:23:44.026 A:middle
as the labels we choose to
apply to these concepts.

00:23:44.826 --> 00:23:48.406 A:middle
So we are introducing NS
Person Name Components

00:23:48.606 --> 00:23:50.326 A:middle
and NS Person Name
Components Formatter.

00:23:50.706 --> 00:23:51.806 A:middle
We have already gotten the joke

00:23:51.806 --> 00:23:53.236 A:middle
that people can't
fit this into Tweets.

00:23:53.346 --> 00:23:55.726 A:middle
But it's a little long and it's
a little difficult to work with,

00:23:55.756 --> 00:23:58.036 A:middle
but, that is to say, it's very
precise as to what it does.

00:23:58.096 --> 00:23:59.366 A:middle
It formats person names.



00:24:00.456 --> 00:24:01.926 A:middle
So here is how you would use it.

00:24:02.626 --> 00:24:05.486 A:middle
You initialize an NS Person
Name Components object.

00:24:06.006 --> 00:24:07.806 A:middle
You populate the given
name, the middle name,

00:24:07.806 --> 00:24:08.846 A:middle
and the family name fields.

00:24:08.956 --> 00:24:10.606 A:middle
Here is how you would do
this for an English-US user.

00:24:11.406 --> 00:24:13.316 A:middle
For a Russian user,
then, you would populate

00:24:13.606 --> 00:24:16.336 A:middle
"Fyodor Mikhailovich
Dostoyevsky."

00:24:17.056 --> 00:24:18.906 A:middle
Likewise, you are
populating the same fields.

00:24:19.776 --> 00:24:22.756 A:middle
Here is then how
you would format it.

00:24:22.946 --> 00:24:25.776 A:middle
You initialize as NS Person Name
Components Formatter object.

00:24:26.306 --> 00:24:27.886 A:middle
As we've seen with
other NS formatters,

00:24:27.936 --> 00:24:28.986 A:middle
it has a style component.

00:24:29.376 --> 00:24:30.706 A:middle
Here we specify short style.

00:24:31.416 --> 00:24:33.376 A:middle
Then you call 'string from
person name components'

00:24:33.376 --> 00:24:34.926 A:middle
on your Person Name
Components object.

00:24:35.886 --> 00:24:37.736 A:middle
The result of this
call is the following,

00:24:38.066 --> 00:24:42.166 A:middle
for our five available styles:
default, short, medium, long,

00:24:42.166 --> 00:24:43.966 A:middle
and abbreviated, we have
done the right thing

00:24:43.966 --> 00:24:44.656 A:middle
for each language.

00:24:44.656 --> 00:24:46.246 A:middle
A couple of things to note here,

00:24:46.386 --> 00:24:49.386 A:middle
that in fact the short style
differs depending on, one,

00:24:49.386 --> 00:24:51.656 A:middle
the user's locale,
and depending as well

00:24:51.656 --> 00:24:53.726 A:middle
on the individual
user's override settings

00:24:53.726 --> 00:24:55.676 A:middle
within the mail, contacts,
and calendar settings.

00:24:56.446 --> 00:24:59.266 A:middle
As well, for Russian
names, we have determined

00:24:59.266 --> 00:25:02.026 A:middle
that abbreviated names in
this form with first, middle,



00:24:59.266 --> 00:25:02.026 A:middle
that abbreviated names in
this form with first, middle,

00:25:02.026 --> 00:25:02.946 A:middle
and last all shortened

00:25:02.946 --> 00:25:05.396 A:middle
to the first character doesn't
really exist and so, therefore,

00:25:05.396 --> 00:25:07.046 A:middle
we have fallen back
to the short style.

00:25:07.926 --> 00:25:10.476 A:middle
So it's really easy
out of the box

00:25:10.476 --> 00:25:12.166 A:middle
to format names for your users.

00:25:14.016 --> 00:25:17.446 A:middle
So that's numbers, dates,
times, units, and names.

00:25:18.076 --> 00:25:20.346 A:middle
We have looked at how
you can translate now,

00:25:20.886 --> 00:25:22.166 A:middle
translate the strings
in your UI,

00:25:22.466 --> 00:25:24.786 A:middle
how you can format the
units the users are seeing.

00:25:25.366 --> 00:25:27.706 A:middle
Additionally important is
how you handle text received

00:25:27.876 --> 00:25:28.456 A:middle
from the user.

00:25:31.036 --> 00:25:33.516 A:middle
Now, this involves looking
at what a character is,

00:25:33.956 --> 00:25:37.406 A:middle
how it changes based on
casing, how you search

00:25:37.406 --> 00:25:39.616 A:middle
for that character, and,
as well, how you transform

00:25:39.616 --> 00:25:42.136 A:middle
that into another
script, for instance.

00:25:43.186 --> 00:25:44.306 A:middle
To begin with, with
this section,

00:25:44.306 --> 00:25:45.636 A:middle
let's ask a philosophical
question.

00:25:45.916 --> 00:25:46.896 A:middle
What is a character?

00:25:47.746 --> 00:25:49.306 A:middle
To begin with, let's ask,

00:25:49.386 --> 00:25:51.216 A:middle
how many characters
is this emoticon?

00:25:51.856 --> 00:25:54.636 A:middle
This was introduced recently
on iOS and it's possible

00:25:54.636 --> 00:25:56.266 A:middle
to type this on our keyboards.

00:25:57.886 --> 00:25:59.706 A:middle
The answer here is not
immediately straightforward,

00:25:59.706 --> 00:26:01.636 A:middle
although visually it
constitutes a single unit.



00:25:59.706 --> 00:26:01.636 A:middle
although visually it
constitutes a single unit.

00:26:02.136 --> 00:26:05.276 A:middle
Under the hood it's represented
by one, two, three, four, five,

00:26:05.656 --> 00:26:09.926 A:middle
six, seven, eight
individual characters.

00:26:10.726 --> 00:26:14.336 A:middle
Now, actually these are Unicode
code points and depending

00:26:14.336 --> 00:26:16.496 A:middle
on the encoding you are using
it may in fact be more than 8.

00:26:16.496 --> 00:26:18.666 A:middle
It may be 11, for instance, but,

00:26:18.766 --> 00:26:21.586 A:middle
that is to say you shouldn't
have to think about this.

00:26:23.236 --> 00:26:28.026 A:middle
Now, one place where this
becomes really obvious is

00:26:28.026 --> 00:26:29.336 A:middle
in enumerating over a string.

00:26:29.896 --> 00:26:31.396 A:middle
Let's say you have a
string test followed

00:26:31.396 --> 00:26:33.956 A:middle
by the emoji character
we just discussed.

00:26:34.676 --> 00:26:38.426 A:middle
Now you wish to enumerate over
each character within the string

00:26:38.426 --> 00:26:39.916 A:middle
and call 'character at index.'

00:26:40.826 --> 00:26:42.996 A:middle
This will return the
unichars constituting the

00:26:42.996 --> 00:26:43.736 A:middle
individual string.

00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:45.376 A:middle
But this isn't what you want.

00:26:45.376 --> 00:26:49.026 A:middle
In fact, this presents
question mark characters

00:26:49.026 --> 00:26:51.556 A:middle
and sometimes three unprintable
characters, and there is a heart

00:26:51.556 --> 00:26:53.586 A:middle
in the middle for some
reason, so it's not,

00:26:54.506 --> 00:26:56.366 A:middle
this is definitely the
incorrect way to do this.

00:26:57.026 --> 00:26:58.586 A:middle
The correct way to
enumerate over a string is

00:26:58.586 --> 00:27:00.566 A:middle
to call 'enumerate
substrings in range.'



00:26:58.586 --> 00:27:00.566 A:middle
to call 'enumerate
substrings in range.'

00:27:01.106 --> 00:27:04.006 A:middle
Additionally, you pass the 'by
composed character sequences.'

00:27:04.406 --> 00:27:06.206 A:middle
This makes it such that the

00:27:06.206 --> 00:27:08.726 A:middle
under the hood representation
matches the user's visual

00:27:08.726 --> 00:27:09.876 A:middle
representation of the character.

00:27:10.476 --> 00:27:11.866 A:middle
Therefore, when we
call it on this string,

00:27:11.866 --> 00:27:13.656 A:middle
we get back exactly
six characters.

00:27:14.756 --> 00:27:17.816 A:middle
So this is how you would
enumerate over a string.

00:27:18.506 --> 00:27:20.656 A:middle
But sometimes you wish
to transform that string

00:27:20.656 --> 00:27:21.436 A:middle
into a different form.

00:27:22.786 --> 00:27:26.236 A:middle
New in iOS 9 we are
providing the ability,

00:27:26.236 --> 00:27:28.886 A:middle
iOS 9 and El Capitan, we
are providing the ability

00:27:28.886 --> 00:27:29.946 A:middle
to transform that string.

00:27:30.896 --> 00:27:32.766 A:middle
So let's say your
string is "istanbul."

00:27:33.566 --> 00:27:35.086 A:middle
A naïve way to capitalize
the string would be

00:27:35.086 --> 00:27:39.156 A:middle
to simply call the
'capitalize string' property.

00:27:39.956 --> 00:27:41.796 A:middle
For English-US users
this may look correct.

00:27:41.966 --> 00:27:43.696 A:middle
Indeed, this is,
for English users,

00:27:43.696 --> 00:27:44.856 A:middle
the correct way to
capitalize this.

00:27:45.226 --> 00:27:47.826 A:middle
But for a speaker of Turkish,
the dotted lower case i

00:27:47.826 --> 00:27:49.696 A:middle
in fact becomes a
dotted upper case I.

00:27:50.746 --> 00:27:53.156 A:middle
To immediately gain
the benefit of this,

00:27:53.476 --> 00:27:55.796 A:middle
you can simply call
'localized capitalized string'

00:27:56.586 --> 00:27:57.516 A:middle
on that string.

00:27:57.756 --> 00:27:59.586 A:middle
And, therefore, you will get
the appropriate capitalized

00:27:59.586 --> 00:28:01.386 A:middle
representation of the
string, that is to say,



00:27:59.586 --> 00:28:01.386 A:middle
representation of the
string, that is to say,

00:28:01.476 --> 00:28:03.916 A:middle
the string with the first
character upper cased.

00:28:04.796 --> 00:28:08.186 A:middle
Now, in addition to
'localized capitalized string,

00:28:08.186 --> 00:28:10.496 A:middle
we are also providing
'localized uppercase string'

00:28:10.496 --> 00:28:11.706 A:middle
and 'localized lowercase
string.'

00:28:11.796 --> 00:28:13.476 A:middle
Here is what these look like.

00:28:14.706 --> 00:28:17.166 A:middle
So you can out of the box
make use of these characters

00:28:17.166 --> 00:28:18.796 A:middle
by simply using the
localized variants

00:28:19.096 --> 00:28:20.416 A:middle
of the already existing APIs.

00:28:21.446 --> 00:28:24.606 A:middle
So, that's how you transform
the case of your string,

00:28:24.606 --> 00:28:26.966 A:middle
but let's say you wish to search
for a string within another.

00:28:27.836 --> 00:28:28.856 A:middle
Here is also where we get back

00:28:28.856 --> 00:28:30.416 A:middle
to our question,
what is a character?

00:28:31.676 --> 00:28:35.066 A:middle
And what are our users
expecting when they expect

00:28:35.066 --> 00:28:36.116 A:middle
to search for a given string?

00:28:36.846 --> 00:28:39.616 A:middle
So, let's say we have the
variable here representing the

00:28:39.616 --> 00:28:40.516 A:middle
German word "uber."

00:28:41.236 --> 00:28:42.336 A:middle
Now this has a capital U,

00:28:42.736 --> 00:28:44.356 A:middle
and happens to use
an umlaut over the U.

00:28:45.186 --> 00:28:48.546 A:middle
A user might expect, given the
way we typically write this word

00:28:48.546 --> 00:28:51.896 A:middle
in English, that lower case
"uber" will find the string.

00:28:52.776 --> 00:28:56.566 A:middle
As a developer you may call
'range of string' to find it,

00:28:57.106 --> 00:28:58.516 A:middle
when in fact this
will return nil.

00:28:59.646 --> 00:29:02.106 A:middle
The correct way to search
for this, and new in iOS 9



00:28:59.646 --> 00:29:02.106 A:middle
The correct way to search
for this, and new in iOS 9

00:29:02.106 --> 00:29:05.156 A:middle
and El Capitan, is 'localized
standard range of string.'

00:29:05.926 --> 00:29:07.836 A:middle
This will allow you to
search for this string

00:29:07.836 --> 00:29:11.466 A:middle
within the other using
diacritic insensitivity as well

00:29:11.466 --> 00:29:13.636 A:middle
as capitalization insensitivity.

00:29:14.476 --> 00:29:16.376 A:middle
Additionally, it
provides allowances

00:29:16.376 --> 00:29:17.606 A:middle
for a given user's locale.

00:29:18.346 --> 00:29:20.866 A:middle
So, here, we've found the
lowercase string "uber"

00:29:20.956 --> 00:29:25.886 A:middle
within 'capital U-umlaut-ber' by
simply calling these new APIs.

00:29:27.276 --> 00:29:29.976 A:middle
So, in addition to
searching through the string,

00:29:30.366 --> 00:29:32.666 A:middle
sometimes you may wish to
transform the entire string.

00:29:33.846 --> 00:29:35.486 A:middle
Now, this is where
transforms come in.

00:29:36.246 --> 00:29:38.436 A:middle
Transforms allow you to
translate between an uppercase

00:29:38.436 --> 00:29:40.156 A:middle
and a lowercase variant
of an entire string.

00:29:40.736 --> 00:29:43.656 A:middle
Additionally they allow you
to do Unicode normalization.

00:29:43.656 --> 00:29:45.956 A:middle
That is to say, they take
out the diacritic characters

00:29:45.956 --> 00:29:47.176 A:middle
and separate them
out, such that A

00:29:47.176 --> 00:29:50.186 A:middle
with an umlaut becomes
A plus umlaut character.

00:29:51.096 --> 00:29:52.006 A:middle
Additionally, we allow you

00:29:52.006 --> 00:29:54.566 A:middle
to script-to-script
conversion, or transliteration.

00:29:54.566 --> 00:29:57.126 A:middle
That is to say, going from
Chinese Han characters

00:29:57.426 --> 00:29:58.626 A:middle
to their Latin representation.

00:29:59.366 --> 00:30:00.886 A:middle
Now, formerly this was
available to you only



00:29:59.366 --> 00:30:00.886 A:middle
Now, formerly this was
available to you only

00:30:00.886 --> 00:30:02.106 A:middle
at the Core Foundation level.

00:30:03.256 --> 00:30:06.876 A:middle
New in iOS 9 and El Capitan,
we allow you to access this

00:30:06.876 --> 00:30:07.756 A:middle
at the Foundation level.

00:30:09.206 --> 00:30:11.176 A:middle
You simply call a 'string
by applying transform.'

00:30:12.216 --> 00:30:14.406 A:middle
Then you provide a
string or here a constant,

00:30:15.376 --> 00:30:18.836 A:middle
representing how you wish
to transform the string.

00:30:19.446 --> 00:30:22.206 A:middle
Here, we wish to translate
the emoji character or, sorry,

00:30:22.206 --> 00:30:25.376 A:middle
transliterate the emoji
character "thumbs up"

00:30:25.456 --> 00:30:27.056 A:middle
into an XML representation.

00:30:28.606 --> 00:30:31.426 A:middle
To do this, it's as
simple as calling 'string

00:30:31.426 --> 00:30:32.346 A:middle
by applying transform'

00:30:32.566 --> 00:30:35.176 A:middle
and provide 'NS String
Transform to XML Hex.'

00:30:35.906 --> 00:30:39.406 A:middle
We additionally provide such
transforms as Han characters

00:30:39.406 --> 00:30:43.796 A:middle
to Latin, and between different
European scripts as well.

00:30:44.536 --> 00:30:47.286 A:middle
So it's super easy,
then, to translate,

00:30:47.286 --> 00:30:49.926 A:middle
transliterate your string
from one script to another,

00:30:49.926 --> 00:30:53.096 A:middle
and provide transforms from
your individual characters

00:30:53.256 --> 00:30:54.356 A:middle
to different representations.

00:30:55.346 --> 00:30:58.916 A:middle
So, that's how you handle text
within our operating system

00:30:59.366 --> 00:31:00.596 A:middle
as received from the user.



00:30:59.366 --> 00:31:00.596 A:middle
as received from the user.

00:31:01.546 --> 00:31:03.086 A:middle
Additionally important
is the way you lay

00:31:03.086 --> 00:31:04.726 A:middle
out visual elements
on the screen.

00:31:06.446 --> 00:31:10.236 A:middle
Now, here is where
auto layout comes in.

00:31:11.226 --> 00:31:12.976 A:middle
Auto layout was released
several releases ago

00:31:13.416 --> 00:31:14.726 A:middle
and the original intention was

00:31:14.986 --> 00:31:18.706 A:middle
to format given UI
differently based on the amount

00:31:18.706 --> 00:31:20.206 A:middle
of screen real estate
available to you.

00:31:20.506 --> 00:31:22.306 A:middle
This has become increasingly
important

00:31:22.306 --> 00:31:23.806 A:middle
as we've released
different form factors

00:31:23.806 --> 00:31:28.156 A:middle
for our devices both
on iOS and OS X.

00:31:28.236 --> 00:31:32.156 A:middle
But I should say an additional
benefit of auto layout is

00:31:32.156 --> 00:31:34.566 A:middle
in localizing the UI
of your application.

00:31:36.596 --> 00:31:39.156 A:middle
Here is what a UI
would look like.

00:31:39.156 --> 00:31:40.086 A:middle
So, let's say, for instance,

00:31:40.086 --> 00:31:42.076 A:middle
we wish to add a new
calendar to iCloud.

00:31:42.646 --> 00:31:44.336 A:middle
Here is what a sample UI
may look like in English.

00:31:44.886 --> 00:31:47.606 A:middle
This UI may have been worked
on meticulously and may work

00:31:47.606 --> 00:31:50.526 A:middle
when you test it in
different orientations

00:31:50.796 --> 00:31:53.806 A:middle
and may work even dynamically
with content added at runtime.

00:31:54.916 --> 00:31:58.496 A:middle
But if you haven't taken
allowances for how this works

00:31:58.496 --> 00:32:00.466 A:middle
in other UIs or in
other languages,



00:31:58.496 --> 00:32:00.466 A:middle
in other UIs or in
other languages,

00:32:00.816 --> 00:32:03.366 A:middle
in fact it may break
these assumptions

00:32:03.366 --> 00:32:04.426 A:middle
that you've had up until now.

00:32:05.596 --> 00:32:09.996 A:middle
So here is the same UI in Greek,
and this may work, this may seem

00:32:09.996 --> 00:32:11.156 A:middle
to work on first glance.

00:32:11.776 --> 00:32:13.616 A:middle
When you take a little closer
look, we realize, in fact,

00:32:13.616 --> 00:32:16.286 A:middle
this character is now
3.5 characters long.

00:32:16.286 --> 00:32:18.036 A:middle
There are additional
sections of the UI

00:32:18.036 --> 00:32:19.046 A:middle
that have this problem as well.

00:32:19.816 --> 00:32:22.016 A:middle
Now, I should say that it's not
necessary to localize your app

00:32:22.066 --> 00:32:23.706 A:middle
to test it in a different
localization.

00:32:24.216 --> 00:32:27.686 A:middle
Thanks to XCode's Skin menu
you can test your app using a

00:32:27.686 --> 00:32:29.096 A:middle
double-width pseudo-language,

00:32:29.096 --> 00:32:30.836 A:middle
as well as a right-to-left
pseudo-language,

00:32:31.426 --> 00:32:33.836 A:middle
that doesn't require you to
have a translation on hand

00:32:34.186 --> 00:32:36.456 A:middle
to see how your UI would
operate in different contexts.

00:32:37.566 --> 00:32:39.916 A:middle
So, assuming then you
are using auto layout

00:32:40.366 --> 00:32:42.706 A:middle
and you have set your
hugging priorities

00:32:43.146 --> 00:32:45.106 A:middle
and your compression
resistance priorities correctly,

00:32:45.576 --> 00:32:47.606 A:middle
here is what your
UI would look like.

00:32:47.656 --> 00:32:52.576 A:middle
We have seen what was formerly
3.5 characters is now 12.

00:32:53.176 --> 00:32:55.186 A:middle
This is a huge difference.

00:32:55.556 --> 00:32:58.026 A:middle
We have allowed our label to
expand the available space given

00:32:58.026 --> 00:33:01.766 A:middle
to us by specifying
not static constraints



00:32:58.026 --> 00:33:01.766 A:middle
to us by specifying
not static constraints

00:33:01.766 --> 00:33:02.996 A:middle
but rather those that can grow.

00:33:03.366 --> 00:33:06.196 A:middle
We say that the constraint is
less than or equal to the width

00:33:06.256 --> 00:33:06.996 A:middle
to the edge of the screen.

00:33:07.736 --> 00:33:09.346 A:middle
So, for a lot more
information about this,

00:33:09.346 --> 00:33:11.636 A:middle
I would really encourage you
to check out yesterday's talk,

00:33:12.186 --> 00:33:14.226 A:middle
"Mysteries of Auto
Layout, Part 1 and 2."

00:33:14.976 --> 00:33:16.096 A:middle
Those go into a lot more detail

00:33:16.446 --> 00:33:18.646 A:middle
about how you can use auto
layout to make your app work

00:33:18.646 --> 00:33:22.256 A:middle
around the world, as well as for
different device orientations.

00:33:23.586 --> 00:33:28.696 A:middle
So, also a thing to keep in
mind in laying out your UI is

00:33:28.696 --> 00:33:30.986 A:middle
that table cells
themselves may change size.

00:33:31.896 --> 00:33:33.166 A:middle
This relates to dynamic type.

00:33:33.496 --> 00:33:35.676 A:middle
On the left, we have
an English-US UI,

00:33:35.676 --> 00:33:36.976 A:middle
on the right, we have Hindi.

00:33:37.716 --> 00:33:38.736 A:middle
Now, notice that, actually,

00:33:38.736 --> 00:33:41.516 A:middle
individual cells are
different heights here.

00:33:41.966 --> 00:33:43.976 A:middle
This is because the
cells are auto resizing.

00:33:43.976 --> 00:33:46.396 A:middle
We have allowed the cells
to take up the amount

00:33:46.396 --> 00:33:49.366 A:middle
of space dictated by the
line height of that language.

00:33:50.186 --> 00:33:53.246 A:middle
So if you use standard
UI controls and UI views,

00:33:53.246 --> 00:33:55.856 A:middle
you will see, you will get
this behavior for free.

00:33:56.606 --> 00:33:59.026 A:middle
But important to keep in mind
from a developer perspective is

00:33:59.026 --> 00:33:59.926 A:middle
that you shouldn't assume

00:33:59.926 --> 00:34:01.696 A:middle
that a given table cell
will be a certain height.



00:33:59.926 --> 00:34:01.696 A:middle
that a given table cell
will be a certain height.

00:34:02.186 --> 00:34:05.146 A:middle
It may expand in
different locales to take

00:34:05.146 --> 00:34:06.536 A:middle
up a different amount of space.

00:34:08.516 --> 00:34:11.876 A:middle
So additionally important
and critical in iOS 9 is

00:34:11.876 --> 00:34:13.806 A:middle
that we have now
provided full support

00:34:13.806 --> 00:34:15.025 A:middle
for right-to-left languages.

00:34:15.335 --> 00:34:18.346 A:middle
On the left, we have an English
UI, and on the right, an Arabic.

00:34:19.116 --> 00:34:20.826 A:middle
Now, the changes here are deep.

00:34:21.376 --> 00:34:23.346 A:middle
We have gone through the
standard controls and views,

00:34:23.636 --> 00:34:26.216 A:middle
and switched the
overall control flow.

00:34:26.826 --> 00:34:30.216 A:middle
In English, you would go from
one menu into a detail menu

00:34:30.216 --> 00:34:31.246 A:middle
by going left to right.

00:34:31.846 --> 00:34:34.735 A:middle
Now, in right-to-left languages
you go to right to left.

00:34:35.246 --> 00:34:37.156 A:middle
Note that the chevrons
themselves have shifted.

00:34:37.446 --> 00:34:40.446 A:middle
The accessory views are
on the other side and much

00:34:40.446 --> 00:34:42.016 A:middle
of the text itself
has been flipped.

00:34:43.016 --> 00:34:45.025 A:middle
Important to keep in mind,
though, is not everything

00:34:45.025 --> 00:34:50.985 A:middle
in the UI may shift, and may
not automatically shift for you.

00:34:50.985 --> 00:34:53.126 A:middle
Sometimes you may wish to
customize the behavior.

00:34:53.926 --> 00:34:57.796 A:middle
As we see here in the 'do not
disturb' icon which is, in fact,

00:34:57.796 --> 00:35:00.756 A:middle
still left to right, as
well as the Latin text



00:34:57.796 --> 00:35:00.756 A:middle
still left to right, as
well as the Latin text

00:35:00.756 --> 00:35:02.546 A:middle
which is still left
to right as well.

00:35:03.086 --> 00:35:05.186 A:middle
Now, for a lot more
information about this,

00:35:05.186 --> 00:35:07.386 A:middle
I would really encourage you
to check out "New UIKit Support

00:35:07.386 --> 00:35:09.436 A:middle
for International Interfaces"
which happened yesterday.

00:35:10.246 --> 00:35:13.166 A:middle
This goes through how you
can use standard controls

00:35:13.446 --> 00:35:15.416 A:middle
to make use of and
gain the benefit

00:35:15.416 --> 00:35:17.846 A:middle
of the full right-to-left
support in iOS 9,

00:35:18.456 --> 00:35:20.376 A:middle
additionally how you may
wish to customize this

00:35:20.656 --> 00:35:21.806 A:middle
for your individual app needs.

00:35:23.146 --> 00:35:28.256 A:middle
So, overall, it's important
to remember to keep in mind

00:35:28.706 --> 00:35:32.056 A:middle
in internationalizing your app,
first the localization aspect,

00:35:32.546 --> 00:35:34.166 A:middle
how it is that your
strings are translated,

00:35:34.456 --> 00:35:36.666 A:middle
how it is that the concepts
behind the translations are

00:35:36.666 --> 00:35:38.286 A:middle
themselves translated
to your users.

00:35:38.916 --> 00:35:42.426 A:middle
Additionally, formatting, how it
is that units, dates, numbers,

00:35:42.426 --> 00:35:44.916 A:middle
times, and now names are
formatted to your user.

00:35:46.166 --> 00:35:48.746 A:middle
Handling text, how is it that
you take the text from the user

00:35:49.126 --> 00:35:50.586 A:middle
and perform operations on it.

00:35:51.116 --> 00:35:53.596 A:middle
This brings back the eternal
question, what is a character?

00:35:53.916 --> 00:35:55.956 A:middle
Something you should always
keep in mind in processing text.

00:35:56.266 --> 00:35:59.906 A:middle
Finally we have layout, how it
is that your UI elements appear

00:35:59.906 --> 00:36:01.386 A:middle
on the screen to
international users.



00:35:59.906 --> 00:36:01.386 A:middle
on the screen to
international users.

00:36:02.276 --> 00:36:04.336 A:middle
Now, luckily if you're
using the localized variants

00:36:04.336 --> 00:36:07.546 A:middle
of existing APIs, as well as
standard views and controls,

00:36:07.786 --> 00:36:09.326 A:middle
you should get all of
this behavior for free.

00:36:10.136 --> 00:36:11.266 A:middle
Now, if you keep all
of this in in mind,

00:36:11.266 --> 00:36:13.646 A:middle
you will find
internationalization opens the

00:36:13.646 --> 00:36:15.026 A:middle
world to your application.

00:36:16.576 --> 00:36:18.836 A:middle
For more information, do
check out these slides here,

00:36:19.016 --> 00:36:20.896 A:middle
or do check out the
documentation here.

00:36:21.336 --> 00:36:26.616 A:middle
Contact our developer forums or
our App Frameworks Evangelist,

00:36:26.616 --> 00:36:31.216 A:middle
Paul Marcos, and also check
out these related sessions.

00:36:31.596 --> 00:36:33.436 A:middle
These have in fact already
happened, so check them

00:36:33.436 --> 00:36:35.026 A:middle
out in your app or online.

00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:38.176 A:middle
Also, however, we will be
offering an internationalization

00:36:38.176 --> 00:36:41.596 A:middle
lab today from 11:00 to 1:10
p.m. So do come check us out.

00:36:41.596 --> 00:36:43.206 A:middle
I will be there as
well as my team

00:36:43.206 --> 00:36:45.536 A:middle
to answer questions you have
about internationalizing

00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:46.466 A:middle
and localizing your apps.

00:36:47.326 --> 00:36:48.596 A:middle
So, thank you.

00:36:49.516 --> 00:36:52.500 A:middle
[Applause]
