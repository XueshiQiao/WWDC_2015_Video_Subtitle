00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:23.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:24.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; CORBIN DUNN: Hi.

00:00:25.386 --> 00:00:27.686 A:middle
Welcome to Improving the
Full-Screen Window Experience.

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:29.436 A:middle
My name is Corbin Dunn.

00:00:29.486 --> 00:00:31.226 A:middle
I'm an AppKit Software Engineer.

00:00:31.376 --> 00:00:32.846 A:middle
And I'll be giving
this talk today

00:00:32.846 --> 00:00:34.186 A:middle
with my colleague, Taylor Kelly.

00:00:34.686 --> 00:00:36.056 A:middle
And let's jump right in to it.

00:00:36.726 --> 00:00:38.286 A:middle
So what are we going
to talk about today?

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:40.616 A:middle
First I'm going to talk about
Full Screen, and I'm going

00:00:40.616 --> 00:00:42.146 A:middle
to cover three sections.

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:44.766 A:middle
I'm going to talk about
adopting Full Screen

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:45.966 A:middle
and how to properly adopt it.

00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:49.046 A:middle
I'm going to talk about Title
Bar Accessory View Controllers,

00:00:49.326 --> 00:00:50.846 A:middle
what they are and
how to use them.

00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:54.326 A:middle
Then I'm going to talk about
Full Screen Tiling API to see

00:00:54.326 --> 00:00:55.626 A:middle
and utilize some
of the new features

00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:57.496 A:middle
that you've seen
in Mac OS X v11.

00:00:58.326 --> 00:01:00.346 A:middle
Taylor's going to come up and
talk about flexible layout



00:00:58.326 --> 00:01:00.346 A:middle
Taylor's going to come up and
talk about flexible layout

00:01:00.346 --> 00:01:03.526 A:middle
within a Split View Controller,
Auto Layout, Stack View,

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:06.026 A:middle
and finally some
Collection View things.

00:01:06.606 --> 00:01:09.016 A:middle
So Full Screen.

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:11.216 A:middle
What is the purpose
of Full Screen?

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:14.166 A:middle
It's to focus your user's
attention on a single task.

00:01:14.896 --> 00:01:16.956 A:middle
You can make the most of
your screen real estate.

00:01:17.316 --> 00:01:18.806 A:middle
Everything extra
is out of the way,

00:01:18.806 --> 00:01:22.356 A:middle
and you have one window
there to concentrate on.

00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:26.026 A:middle
So why did we make
it a system feature?

00:01:26.706 --> 00:01:28.046 A:middle
We have it as a system feature

00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:31.196 A:middle
because it's a very
consistent user experience.

00:01:31.656 --> 00:01:33.556 A:middle
The way you get into Full
Screen, the way you get

00:01:33.556 --> 00:01:35.466 A:middle
out of Full Screen,
it's all the same.

00:01:35.746 --> 00:01:37.796 A:middle
The way you navigate
across spaces, etcetera.

00:01:39.236 --> 00:01:42.636 A:middle
So what is a Full
Screen-capable window?

00:01:43.046 --> 00:01:45.076 A:middle
Here's an example of a
window such as Safari.

00:01:45.616 --> 00:01:48.536 A:middle
And I'm sure you're aware of
that you click the green button,

00:01:48.816 --> 00:01:50.096 A:middle
it'll take you into Full Screen.

00:01:51.376 --> 00:01:53.866 A:middle
Once you're into Full Screen,
you can mouse on up to the top

00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:56.716 A:middle
of the window, and the title
bar and toolbar will drop down.

00:01:57.246 --> 00:01:58.696 A:middle
And you can hit that
green button again,

00:01:58.786 --> 00:02:00.696 A:middle
and it can take you
back out of Full Screen.



00:01:58.786 --> 00:02:00.696 A:middle
and it can take you
back out of Full Screen.

00:02:01.286 --> 00:02:05.126 A:middle
So what are the things to
do to adopt Full Screen?

00:02:05.326 --> 00:02:06.806 A:middle
Hopefully you're
already aware of this,

00:02:07.076 --> 00:02:08.235 A:middle
but it's pretty easy to do.

00:02:08.526 --> 00:02:10.705 A:middle
You're going to specify
which windows you want

00:02:10.705 --> 00:02:11.776 A:middle
to be Full Screen-capable.

00:02:11.776 --> 00:02:14.026 A:middle
You're going to add
a menu item for it,

00:02:14.026 --> 00:02:16.566 A:middle
and you're probably going
to do some extra stuff.

00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:17.706 A:middle
The extra stuff that
you might want

00:02:17.706 --> 00:02:21.706 A:middle
to do is auto hide your
toolbar, modify your contents

00:02:21.836 --> 00:02:24.706 A:middle
to take more advantage
of the Full Screen space

00:02:24.706 --> 00:02:28.106 A:middle
that you now have, use the
new title bar accessory

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:28.946 A:middle
view controllers.

00:02:28.946 --> 00:02:31.116 A:middle
And I'm going to talk about how
and why you're going to do that.

00:02:31.856 --> 00:02:33.976 A:middle
And of course, you want to work
well with Full Screen tiles.

00:02:34.246 --> 00:02:36.846 A:middle
So I'm going to discuss some
API that we have for that.

00:02:37.426 --> 00:02:41.106 A:middle
First of all, there are
two types of windows that,

00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:44.946 A:middle
or two options for windows
to be in Full Screen.

00:02:45.706 --> 00:02:47.406 A:middle
Normally when a window
is in Full Screen,

00:02:47.926 --> 00:02:49.146 A:middle
nothing else is allowed with it.

00:02:49.646 --> 00:02:52.286 A:middle
And that window is what we
call the primary window.

00:02:52.666 --> 00:02:55.366 A:middle
It's something such as
your main document window

00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:56.226 A:middle
for your application.

00:02:56.646 --> 00:02:58.596 A:middle
It's the thing that you can
go into Full Screen with.

00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:02.336 A:middle
However, there's also another
option if you've seen this.



00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:02.336 A:middle
However, there's also another
option if you've seen this.

00:03:02.576 --> 00:03:05.696 A:middle
It's an auxiliary window, and
usually you don't need this.

00:03:06.076 --> 00:03:09.256 A:middle
What its purpose is if you
have a window in an application

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:11.836 A:middle
that wants to be on another
application's Full Screen space,

00:03:11.836 --> 00:03:13.046 A:middle
it allows you to do that.

00:03:13.046 --> 00:03:15.106 A:middle
And I'm not going
to talk about it.

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:17.696 A:middle
And I encourage you to look
at the AppKit release notes

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:20.786 A:middle
from a few years ago to
see some details on it.

00:03:21.356 --> 00:03:23.976 A:middle
So how do you adopt
Full Screen windows?

00:03:24.656 --> 00:03:26.976 A:middle
In Xcode and Interface
Builder, it's very simple.

00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:28.606 A:middle
You select your window.

00:03:28.606 --> 00:03:29.946 A:middle
There's a Full Screen section.

00:03:30.456 --> 00:03:31.676 A:middle
You drop down the menu item,

00:03:31.676 --> 00:03:33.876 A:middle
and you have either
primary or auxiliary.

00:03:33.876 --> 00:03:35.796 A:middle
So you're going to probably
want to set primary window

00:03:36.256 --> 00:03:37.586 A:middle
on your primary Full
Screen window.

00:03:38.186 --> 00:03:43.196 A:middle
Of course you can do it in code,
and the thing under the hood

00:03:43.196 --> 00:03:46.766 A:middle
of what that Interface Builder
option is doing is just changing

00:03:46.766 --> 00:03:49.406 A:middle
the window collection
behavior, and it's adding

00:03:49.406 --> 00:03:52.796 A:middle
in dot Full Screen primary
or dot Full Screen auxiliary

00:03:52.796 --> 00:03:55.616 A:middle
to the window to get those
options into that window

00:03:56.116 --> 00:03:57.386 A:middle
and make it Full Screen-capable.

00:03:59.226 --> 00:04:02.196 A:middle
Once you are in Full
Screen, you may need



00:03:59.226 --> 00:04:02.196 A:middle
Once you are in Full
Screen, you may need

00:04:02.196 --> 00:04:05.006 A:middle
to do different things based
on being in Full Screen.

00:04:05.506 --> 00:04:08.426 A:middle
And you can check that by
looking at the style mask.

00:04:09.036 --> 00:04:10.576 A:middle
It's when your window
goes into Full Screen,

00:04:10.926 --> 00:04:12.806 A:middle
we add the
NSFullScreenWindowMask

00:04:13.176 --> 00:04:14.456 A:middle
for you automatically.

00:04:14.456 --> 00:04:16.836 A:middle
And you can check that
in the style mask to see

00:04:16.836 --> 00:04:18.486 A:middle
if your window is in
Full Screen or not

00:04:18.916 --> 00:04:20.226 A:middle
and potentially do
different things.

00:04:20.356 --> 00:04:22.556 A:middle
Now let's talk

00:04:22.766 --> 00:04:25.976 A:middle
about automatically
hiding the toolbar.

00:04:26.426 --> 00:04:28.046 A:middle
Normally if you have a
toolbar in your window,

00:04:28.196 --> 00:04:29.766 A:middle
it's always visible, like
it's showing up here.

00:04:31.106 --> 00:04:33.466 A:middle
When you mouse on up to
the top of the window,

00:04:33.466 --> 00:04:34.706 A:middle
the menu bar drops down.

00:04:35.216 --> 00:04:36.706 A:middle
The title bar controls
drop down.

00:04:37.196 --> 00:04:38.956 A:middle
And the toolbar is revealed.

00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:41.076 A:middle
There's an option for you

00:04:41.076 --> 00:04:42.556 A:middle
to automatically have
the toolbar hidden.

00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:45.516 A:middle
So when you go to Full
Screen, nothing else is seen,

00:04:45.516 --> 00:04:47.596 A:middle
and you get the most use
of your screen real estate.

00:04:48.116 --> 00:04:50.466 A:middle
When you're mousing
up to the menu bar,

00:04:50.866 --> 00:04:54.286 A:middle
the toolbar is dropped down,
along with the menu bar

00:04:54.286 --> 00:04:55.446 A:middle
and the title bar
at the same time.

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:57.766 A:middle
It's really easy to do this.

00:04:58.306 --> 00:04:59.566 A:middle
There's a window
delegate method,



00:05:00.006 --> 00:05:03.986 A:middle
Window Will Use Full
Screen Presentation Options,

00:05:04.686 --> 00:05:05.866 A:middle
with the proposed options.

00:05:06.486 --> 00:05:09.726 A:middle
You take those proposed options,
and you add Auto Hide Toolbar

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:10.906 A:middle
to it and return that.

00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:12.946 A:middle
And the toolbar will
automatically be hidden.

00:05:13.386 --> 00:05:16.296 A:middle
So it's very easy to do.

00:05:16.556 --> 00:05:20.406 A:middle
So custom animations, you
can create a custom animation

00:05:20.406 --> 00:05:22.466 A:middle
to enter and exit
from Full Screen.

00:05:22.886 --> 00:05:24.426 A:middle
We have two delegate
methods to do it.

00:05:25.166 --> 00:05:27.146 A:middle
The custom windows to enter
Full Screen for a window

00:05:27.506 --> 00:05:30.486 A:middle
where you return an array of
windows that do your animation.

00:05:31.246 --> 00:05:33.226 A:middle
And then we call you
back and say, hey,

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:35.456 A:middle
start your custom animation
to enter Full Screen

00:05:35.686 --> 00:05:36.846 A:middle
with a particular duration.

00:05:37.566 --> 00:05:40.776 A:middle
The thing to note about these
now with the way that we enter

00:05:40.776 --> 00:05:42.396 A:middle
into Full Screen
in Mac OS X v11,

00:05:42.766 --> 00:05:44.156 A:middle
you may not get these called.

00:05:44.546 --> 00:05:46.526 A:middle
So it's important
to not be dependent

00:05:46.526 --> 00:05:49.356 A:middle
on these always being called
and setting up state there.

00:05:49.726 --> 00:05:51.546 A:middle
Instead, there's better ways
to do that, which I'll talk

00:05:51.546 --> 00:05:55.166 A:middle
about in a little bit.

00:05:55.346 --> 00:05:57.196 A:middle
Okay, so that was
talking about Full Screen

00:05:57.286 --> 00:05:58.886 A:middle
and how to properly adopt it.

00:05:59.256 --> 00:06:01.416 A:middle
Let's move forward
and go about talking



00:05:59.256 --> 00:06:01.416 A:middle
Let's move forward
and go about talking

00:06:01.416 --> 00:06:03.336 A:middle
about Title Bar Accessory
View Controllers.

00:06:05.016 --> 00:06:08.336 A:middle
So before I talk about a title
bar accessory controller,

00:06:08.586 --> 00:06:11.326 A:middle
let's take a look at a window
in Full Screen, and I'm going

00:06:11.326 --> 00:06:13.346 A:middle
to highlight the area
that is the title bar

00:06:13.556 --> 00:06:14.386 A:middle
so you're aware of it.

00:06:14.926 --> 00:06:16.426 A:middle
So this is the title
bar in Full Screen.

00:06:17.136 --> 00:06:19.246 A:middle
Underneath the title
bar is the toolbar.

00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:23.086 A:middle
And underneath the toolbar
are what we have called the

00:06:23.086 --> 00:06:24.096 A:middle
accessory views.

00:06:24.596 --> 00:06:27.146 A:middle
And so you can add your own
title bar accessory view

00:06:27.146 --> 00:06:29.976 A:middle
controllers at this
location in the window.

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:33.746 A:middle
And the nice thing is that
they can also be added

00:06:33.746 --> 00:06:35.336 A:middle
when your window
isn't in Full Screen.

00:06:35.846 --> 00:06:36.836 A:middle
So this is what they would look

00:06:36.836 --> 00:06:38.696 A:middle
for one that's not
in Full Screen.

00:06:39.026 --> 00:06:40.776 A:middle
And they're automatically
managed back and forth.

00:06:41.546 --> 00:06:44.226 A:middle
To understand why this
important, it's also good

00:06:44.226 --> 00:06:47.566 A:middle
to understand some of the
reasons that we have it.

00:06:47.666 --> 00:06:49.446 A:middle
So let's take a look
at your window.

00:06:50.146 --> 00:06:54.596 A:middle
And normally, the area under
the toolbar and title bar area,

00:06:54.596 --> 00:06:57.156 A:middle
that's where your
content is placed.

00:06:57.376 --> 00:06:58.716 A:middle
Your content's underneath it.

00:06:59.616 --> 00:07:06.886 A:middle
But as of Mac OS X v10, you can
actually utilize a full content



00:06:59.616 --> 00:07:06.886 A:middle
But as of Mac OS X v10, you can
actually utilize a full content

00:07:06.886 --> 00:07:11.166 A:middle
area that can extend underneath
the title bar toolbar.

00:07:11.496 --> 00:07:12.496 A:middle
And so your title bar

00:07:12.696 --> 00:07:15.896 A:middle
and toolbar will have a
blur automatically handled

00:07:15.896 --> 00:07:16.596 A:middle
for you behind it.

00:07:16.596 --> 00:07:18.846 A:middle
And you can have your
Full Screen accessory view

00:07:18.846 --> 00:07:21.456 A:middle
controllers for your
views in this location.

00:07:22.066 --> 00:07:25.906 A:middle
So how do you get
that Full Screen mask?

00:07:25.976 --> 00:07:26.966 A:middle
It's really easy.

00:07:26.966 --> 00:07:28.496 A:middle
You just add to the
window style mask

00:07:28.586 --> 00:07:30.456 A:middle
in its full size
content view window mask,

00:07:30.456 --> 00:07:35.066 A:middle
and that makes your content be
full size under the title bar.

00:07:35.716 --> 00:07:38.876 A:middle
The actual API for using
the title bar accessory view

00:07:38.876 --> 00:07:41.296 A:middle
dontrollers, they're
a very simple subclass

00:07:41.296 --> 00:07:42.356 A:middle
of NSViewController.

00:07:42.706 --> 00:07:44.836 A:middle
So all the standard view
controller stuff will come

00:07:44.836 --> 00:07:46.416 A:middle
into play with it
for how to load them.

00:07:46.416 --> 00:07:49.676 A:middle
And it adds two properties,
a layout attribute

00:07:49.676 --> 00:07:51.406 A:middle
and a Full Screen min height.

00:07:52.026 --> 00:07:53.646 A:middle
So I'm going to talk
about those in a minute.

00:07:54.426 --> 00:07:55.526 A:middle
But let's look at a few things

00:07:55.526 --> 00:07:58.266 A:middle
that the title bar accessory
view controllers do for you.

00:07:58.936 --> 00:08:00.196 A:middle
Well like I said before,



00:07:58.936 --> 00:08:00.196 A:middle
Well like I said before,

00:08:00.196 --> 00:08:04.556 A:middle
they will automatically blur
everything behind them for you.

00:08:04.556 --> 00:08:05.956 A:middle
You don't have to
do anything special.

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:08.796 A:middle
It's automatically contained
in a visual effect for you,

00:08:08.996 --> 00:08:10.696 A:middle
which is what does
the actual blurring.

00:08:11.206 --> 00:08:13.226 A:middle
They automatically
work in Full Screen.

00:08:13.596 --> 00:08:15.796 A:middle
So when your window goes to Full
Screen and out of Full Screen,

00:08:15.796 --> 00:08:17.266 A:middle
they're placed in
the correct location.

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:20.266 A:middle
And the size is kind of
managed for you automatically.

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:24.276 A:middle
And we'll discuss a little bit
more about that in a minute.

00:08:24.446 --> 00:08:26.966 A:middle
So let's look at the first
property, the layout attribute.

00:08:29.436 --> 00:08:34.145 A:middle
So here is the layout attribute
when it's set to dot bottom.

00:08:34.876 --> 00:08:37.096 A:middle
Dot bottom means
your view is going

00:08:37.096 --> 00:08:39.606 A:middle
to be placed below
the title bar.

00:08:40.576 --> 00:08:42.765 A:middle
Its height is whatever height
you've actually specified

00:08:42.765 --> 00:08:45.296 A:middle
for that view in your nib
or however you specified it.

00:08:45.926 --> 00:08:47.816 A:middle
And the width is
automatically changed

00:08:47.816 --> 00:08:48.966 A:middle
as the window is resized.

00:08:51.056 --> 00:08:52.666 A:middle
Another option is dot right.

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:55.276 A:middle
And this is an example
of Safari.

00:08:55.786 --> 00:08:57.616 A:middle
They're using the dot
right option in order

00:08:57.616 --> 00:09:01.126 A:middle
to add the plus button to the
Safari window when it's not



00:08:57.616 --> 00:09:01.126 A:middle
to add the plus button to the
Safari window when it's not

00:09:01.126 --> 00:09:02.536 A:middle
in Full Screen or
in Full Screen.

00:09:03.516 --> 00:09:06.206 A:middle
The width is whatever width
the view has specified.

00:09:06.596 --> 00:09:08.556 A:middle
And the height is
automatically set to the height

00:09:08.556 --> 00:09:11.626 A:middle
of the title bar or tool bar.

00:09:11.846 --> 00:09:16.436 A:middle
New to Mac OS X v11 is the
ability to specify a dot left.

00:09:17.176 --> 00:09:20.156 A:middle
And with that, you can put
the [inaudible] to the side

00:09:20.156 --> 00:09:21.876 A:middle
of the window buttons.

00:09:22.026 --> 00:09:25.076 A:middle
So you could add something
like a register button here

00:09:25.076 --> 00:09:27.726 A:middle
or some other notes that you
want to show to your user.

00:09:28.566 --> 00:09:34.076 A:middle
And it's another
new thing to X v11.

00:09:34.286 --> 00:09:36.896 A:middle
Next we have the Full
Screen min height.

00:09:38.146 --> 00:09:39.436 A:middle
Let's take a look
at that property.

00:09:40.366 --> 00:09:41.536 A:middle
So the Full Screen min height.

00:09:41.856 --> 00:09:42.756 A:middle
What does this mean?

00:09:43.056 --> 00:09:45.526 A:middle
Well this property
is only applicable

00:09:45.726 --> 00:09:47.736 A:middle
when you're actually
in Full Screen.

00:09:47.736 --> 00:09:50.676 A:middle
And this is the minimum
height that's visible

00:09:50.746 --> 00:09:52.126 A:middle
when you're in Full Screen.

00:09:53.116 --> 00:09:56.656 A:middle
Anything that's not shown
will automatically be shown

00:09:56.656 --> 00:09:58.066 A:middle
when you mouse up
to the toolbar.

00:09:58.066 --> 00:09:59.456 A:middle
And I'll show you
some screenshots

00:09:59.456 --> 00:10:00.376 A:middle
of that in just a second.



00:09:59.456 --> 00:10:00.376 A:middle
of that in just a second.

00:10:01.076 --> 00:10:02.536 A:middle
The default body is zero.

00:10:02.536 --> 00:10:05.186 A:middle
So let's take a look
at what that means.

00:10:06.256 --> 00:10:07.816 A:middle
So a Full Screen
minimum height of zero.

00:10:07.866 --> 00:10:12.446 A:middle
So here's a toolbar, and now
there is an accessory view

00:10:12.446 --> 00:10:13.976 A:middle
controller there,
but it's hidden

00:10:13.976 --> 00:10:15.126 A:middle
because the height is zero.

00:10:15.856 --> 00:10:17.156 A:middle
If the height was non-zero,

00:10:17.386 --> 00:10:20.656 A:middle
you would see whatever
value you set always there.

00:10:20.746 --> 00:10:24.276 A:middle
And the way it's revealed by the
user is you mouse up to the top

00:10:24.276 --> 00:10:27.126 A:middle
of that menu bar, and the
title bar is revealed.

00:10:27.606 --> 00:10:31.336 A:middle
And your Full Screen accessory
view is revealed automatically

00:10:31.336 --> 00:10:32.426 A:middle
with it.

00:10:33.536 --> 00:10:35.186 A:middle
So that's highlighting
that location.

00:10:37.156 --> 00:10:40.446 A:middle
Now if you've used NSToolbar,
you may already be familiar

00:10:40.446 --> 00:10:43.026 A:middle
with Full Screen
accessory view on NSToolbar.

00:10:43.466 --> 00:10:47.026 A:middle
And this new Title Bar Accessory
View Controller supersedes this

00:10:47.026 --> 00:10:47.556 A:middle
older API.

00:10:47.816 --> 00:10:50.046 A:middle
And so we're encouraging
you to not use it anymore.

00:10:50.676 --> 00:10:53.196 A:middle
But the min height and max
height properties work very

00:10:53.196 --> 00:10:56.116 A:middle
similar to what's in title
bar accessory view controller.

00:10:56.706 --> 00:11:00.516 A:middle
So how do you actually add them?



00:10:56.706 --> 00:11:00.516 A:middle
So how do you actually add them?

00:11:00.516 --> 00:11:02.496 A:middle
Well we have four
methods on NSWindow.

00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:06.256 A:middle
We have an array of title bar
accessory view controllers.

00:11:06.256 --> 00:11:08.076 A:middle
You can access what's
attached to the window.

00:11:09.046 --> 00:11:09.796 A:middle
You can add them.

00:11:10.876 --> 00:11:12.376 A:middle
You can insert them
at a particular index.

00:11:13.096 --> 00:11:14.996 A:middle
And you can remove them
at a particular index.

00:11:15.996 --> 00:11:18.476 A:middle
But it's really easy
to just add and remove.

00:11:18.476 --> 00:11:19.846 A:middle
And so here's what
you'll typically do.

00:11:20.236 --> 00:11:22.996 A:middle
You'll call Window Add Title
Bar Accessory View Controller,

00:11:23.736 --> 00:11:25.146 A:middle
pass in your accessory
view controller.

00:11:25.466 --> 00:11:27.046 A:middle
And when you want to remove it,

00:11:27.046 --> 00:11:29.536 A:middle
you'll use our default
NSViewController API,

00:11:30.056 --> 00:11:31.186 A:middle
remove from parent
view controller.

00:11:31.186 --> 00:11:32.666 A:middle
Which just automatically
figured it

00:11:32.666 --> 00:11:34.236 A:middle
out where it is and removes it.

00:11:34.826 --> 00:11:39.976 A:middle
So that was talking about Title
Bar Accessory View Controllers.

00:11:40.546 --> 00:11:41.966 A:middle
Let's talk about
Full Screen tiles

00:11:42.346 --> 00:11:46.136 A:middle
and some new things
in Mac OS X v11.

00:11:46.406 --> 00:11:49.256 A:middle
So Full Screen tiles,
what's the purpose of these?

00:11:49.576 --> 00:11:51.566 A:middle
They still allow you
to focus your attention

00:11:51.566 --> 00:11:53.286 A:middle
or user's attention
on a single task,

00:11:54.076 --> 00:11:55.796 A:middle
but it just might
involve multiple windows.

00:11:56.606 --> 00:11:58.566 A:middle
You get to use all that
screen real estate.

00:11:58.966 --> 00:12:01.956 A:middle
So in this screen shot we have
Safari, and we have reminders



00:11:58.966 --> 00:12:01.956 A:middle
So in this screen shot we have
Safari, and we have reminders

00:12:01.956 --> 00:12:07.296 A:middle
on the side to focus on a
couple tasks at the same time.

00:12:07.526 --> 00:12:09.276 A:middle
So let's take a look
at what happens

00:12:09.276 --> 00:12:10.926 A:middle
when you resize the splitter,

00:12:10.926 --> 00:12:12.366 A:middle
when you are actually
in this mode.

00:12:12.756 --> 00:12:16.646 A:middle
Notice that as I resize,
Safari's window hits a min size

00:12:17.196 --> 00:12:18.696 A:middle
and Reminders hits a min size.

00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:23.566 A:middle
And it doesn't let it shrink
too far for a given window.

00:12:23.736 --> 00:12:26.536 A:middle
So it has a minimum and
maximum that can hit.

00:12:27.916 --> 00:12:29.146 A:middle
So I'm going to talk
about how to do that

00:12:29.706 --> 00:12:30.706 A:middle
and what you need to do.

00:12:31.486 --> 00:12:35.066 A:middle
But first let's talk about,
well, what windows can be put

00:12:35.066 --> 00:12:36.316 A:middle
into a Full Screen tile?

00:12:37.726 --> 00:12:40.896 A:middle
We will implicitly allow
any window to be put

00:12:40.896 --> 00:12:46.046 A:middle
into a Full Screen tile if it's
resizable and it's not a panel.

00:12:46.206 --> 00:12:48.306 A:middle
So that means your
window doesn't have

00:12:48.366 --> 00:12:49.916 A:middle
to be Full Screen-capable.

00:12:50.286 --> 00:12:52.426 A:middle
But it could still
be added as a tile

00:12:52.666 --> 00:12:54.466 A:middle
to another Full Screen-capable
window.

00:12:55.016 --> 00:12:57.296 A:middle
The heuristics in
exactly what we do

00:12:57.296 --> 00:12:59.246 A:middle
and how we determine this
might change over time.



00:13:00.026 --> 00:13:02.436 A:middle
So you might want to
make it more explicit.

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:06.596 A:middle
So let's say that you
have a nonresizable window

00:13:06.696 --> 00:13:09.266 A:middle
that can't be put into a tile,
and you want it to be able

00:13:09.306 --> 00:13:10.186 A:middle
to be put into a tile.

00:13:10.766 --> 00:13:11.686 A:middle
You can explicitly add

00:13:11.786 --> 00:13:14.786 A:middle
to the collection behavior
Full Screen Allows Tiling

00:13:15.236 --> 00:13:17.286 A:middle
to make it allow it
to be put into a tile.

00:13:18.466 --> 00:13:21.096 A:middle
Similarly, you might have
a window which you want

00:13:21.096 --> 00:13:22.656 A:middle
to never be put into a tile.

00:13:23.246 --> 00:13:26.316 A:middle
So we determine it -- it
could be put into a tile,

00:13:26.316 --> 00:13:27.276 A:middle
but you don't want it to be.

00:13:27.276 --> 00:13:30.046 A:middle
So you can make Full
Screen Disallows Tiling

00:13:30.206 --> 00:13:31.656 A:middle
to prevent that.

00:13:32.096 --> 00:13:35.216 A:middle
In addition, you might have a
window, you take it Full Screen,

00:13:35.216 --> 00:13:36.836 A:middle
and you want it to
always be alone.

00:13:37.356 --> 00:13:39.886 A:middle
You can set Full Screen
Disallows Tiling on that window

00:13:40.306 --> 00:13:44.766 A:middle
to have no other
windows be put with it.

00:13:45.026 --> 00:13:48.076 A:middle
So now you know if a
window can be allowed

00:13:48.076 --> 00:13:49.056 A:middle
to be put into a tile.

00:13:49.476 --> 00:13:50.856 A:middle
Let's talk about
some of the minimum,

00:13:50.856 --> 00:13:52.636 A:middle
maximum sizes for that window.

00:13:52.986 --> 00:13:55.846 A:middle
Well normally, when your
window is not in Full Screen,

00:13:56.126 --> 00:13:59.606 A:middle
you can resize it, and it's
automatically restricted

00:13:59.606 --> 00:14:00.656 A:middle
by its min and max size.



00:13:59.606 --> 00:14:00.656 A:middle
by its min and max size.

00:14:00.656 --> 00:14:04.846 A:middle
And that's usually determined
automatically by Auto Layout

00:14:04.846 --> 00:14:05.926 A:middle
when you're using Auto Layout.

00:14:06.996 --> 00:14:08.966 A:middle
If you're using, if you're
not using Auto Layout,

00:14:09.346 --> 00:14:12.496 A:middle
then the window's min size
and max size come into play.

00:14:12.556 --> 00:14:14.486 A:middle
And those are just
explicit properties

00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:15.506 A:middle
that you set in the window.

00:14:16.046 --> 00:14:17.926 A:middle
Or content min size
or content max size,

00:14:17.926 --> 00:14:18.866 A:middle
depending on what you're using.

00:14:20.006 --> 00:14:22.296 A:middle
Now if you're taking a window
and you're going to Full Screen

00:14:22.296 --> 00:14:26.126 A:middle
or you're going to a Full Screen
tile, those are the values

00:14:26.126 --> 00:14:27.556 A:middle
that you should just
normally use.

00:14:28.096 --> 00:14:29.886 A:middle
But there might be
exceptions to that rule,

00:14:29.886 --> 00:14:32.346 A:middle
and so we have some
more API to solve that.

00:14:33.076 --> 00:14:35.496 A:middle
First of all, let's talk about
an exception to that rule

00:14:35.496 --> 00:14:36.166 A:middle
and what you're doing.

00:14:36.386 --> 00:14:38.026 A:middle
So here's something
that might be a little

00:14:38.066 --> 00:14:39.126 A:middle
calculator application.

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:41.206 A:middle
And its size is not resizable.

00:14:41.656 --> 00:14:44.426 A:middle
So this developer might say,
okay, we're going to allow this

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:45.376 A:middle
to be put into a tile.

00:14:46.306 --> 00:14:49.746 A:middle
But when it's put into
a tile, as shown here,

00:14:50.116 --> 00:14:53.006 A:middle
that calculator's app
height is now a lot larger

00:14:53.006 --> 00:14:55.796 A:middle
than it was before, even
though it wasn't resizable.

00:14:56.196 --> 00:14:58.526 A:middle
And so it needs to handle
that and do something special.

00:14:59.326 --> 00:15:02.266 A:middle
You might also add extra views
there to show more information



00:14:59.326 --> 00:15:02.266 A:middle
You might also add extra views
there to show more information

00:15:02.266 --> 00:15:04.786 A:middle
to the user when it's
in a Full Screen tile.

00:15:05.356 --> 00:15:06.896 A:middle
So you can dynamically do this.

00:15:07.246 --> 00:15:08.956 A:middle
And you just use some
window delegate methods,

00:15:09.536 --> 00:15:11.166 A:middle
Window Will Enter Full Screen.

00:15:11.756 --> 00:15:14.236 A:middle
And in this particular case,
when we enter Full Screen,

00:15:14.606 --> 00:15:15.986 A:middle
we're unhiding some views,

00:15:16.466 --> 00:15:17.946 A:middle
changing some constraint
priorities,

00:15:18.026 --> 00:15:20.216 A:middle
which allow the window
to actually be resized

00:15:20.216 --> 00:15:21.696 A:middle
by the system when
it's in Full Screen.

00:15:22.016 --> 00:15:24.596 A:middle
And it just undoes that work
when it exits Full Screen.

00:15:24.596 --> 00:15:27.236 A:middle
It is important to know that
you might actually get these

00:15:27.236 --> 00:15:31.896 A:middle
delegate methods even if your
window does not normally make

00:15:31.896 --> 00:15:33.686 A:middle
itself a Full Screen
primary window.

00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:36.276 A:middle
So this might be called
for a tile window.

00:15:38.296 --> 00:15:42.636 A:middle
Now those windows had a
particular thick size before it

00:15:42.636 --> 00:15:43.466 A:middle
was in Full Screen.

00:15:44.026 --> 00:15:45.996 A:middle
But when it's in Full
Screen, it sizes different.

00:15:46.746 --> 00:15:49.776 A:middle
You will probably need to
tell the system those sizes

00:15:49.896 --> 00:15:51.366 A:middle
when it's going to
be in Full Screen.

00:15:51.856 --> 00:15:53.826 A:middle
So we have explicit
API to do that.

00:15:54.366 --> 00:15:56.206 A:middle
We have a min Full
Screen content size

00:15:56.366 --> 00:15:58.506 A:middle
and a max Full Screen
content size to do that.

00:15:59.796 --> 00:16:02.166 A:middle
You need to set these
early, because if you played



00:15:59.796 --> 00:16:02.166 A:middle
You need to set these
early, because if you played

00:16:02.166 --> 00:16:04.916 A:middle
around with Mac OS X v11,
you may notice when you click

00:16:04.916 --> 00:16:07.646 A:middle
and hold in the green button,
you're provided with a selection

00:16:07.646 --> 00:16:09.626 A:middle
of other candidate
windows that can fit

00:16:09.626 --> 00:16:10.786 A:middle
into that available space.

00:16:11.546 --> 00:16:14.816 A:middle
So you as the developer need
to set these min sizes early

00:16:15.416 --> 00:16:16.536 A:middle
so the system can figure

00:16:16.536 --> 00:16:18.886 A:middle
out what is a potential
candidate for that area.

00:16:20.016 --> 00:16:22.046 A:middle
Like I said before, normally
you don't need to use these.

00:16:22.346 --> 00:16:23.376 A:middle
They're pretty much automatic

00:16:23.526 --> 00:16:25.466 A:middle
when your window is
just normally resizable.

00:16:26.066 --> 00:16:28.546 A:middle
So that presents a dilemma.

00:16:28.706 --> 00:16:32.356 A:middle
What happens if your window
has a min size that's something

00:16:32.356 --> 00:16:36.586 A:middle
like 1200, and there is
another window, a window B,

00:16:36.636 --> 00:16:38.696 A:middle
that says hey, my size is 1300?

00:16:40.096 --> 00:16:41.276 A:middle
Well, the system is going

00:16:41.276 --> 00:16:44.126 A:middle
to not allow these two
windows to be together.

00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:48.116 A:middle
Their min Full Screen
content size is just too large

00:16:48.356 --> 00:16:49.396 A:middle
to actually make it work out.

00:16:50.516 --> 00:16:52.996 A:middle
So what do you need
to do as a developer?

00:16:54.526 --> 00:16:57.006 A:middle
And for that, I'm going to bring
up my colleague, Taylor Kelly,

00:16:57.006 --> 00:16:59.326 A:middle
and he's going to discuss
how to handle that by talking

00:16:59.326 --> 00:17:00.156 A:middle
about flexible layout.



00:16:59.326 --> 00:17:00.156 A:middle
about flexible layout.

00:17:01.136 --> 00:17:01.376 A:middle
Thank you.

00:17:02.516 --> 00:17:13.675 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:17:14.175 --> 00:17:14.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TAYLOR KELLY: Hello.

00:17:15.116 --> 00:17:16.656 A:middle
In this half we're
going to talk about how

00:17:16.656 --> 00:17:19.175 A:middle
to make your layouts more
flexible, especially in terms

00:17:19.175 --> 00:17:21.586 A:middle
of how narrow they can be made
while in a new split view.

00:17:21.586 --> 00:17:26.776 A:middle
On the Mac platform, we have a
wide variety of display sizes

00:17:26.776 --> 00:17:28.016 A:middle
that your application
can run on.

00:17:28.016 --> 00:17:31.256 A:middle
And with Full Screen, users
are able to immerse themselves,

00:17:31.436 --> 00:17:32.686 A:middle
taking up the entire display.

00:17:33.836 --> 00:17:36.466 A:middle
With split view, users are now
able to bring another window

00:17:36.466 --> 00:17:39.326 A:middle
into this environment to
create a richer experience.

00:17:40.086 --> 00:17:43.156 A:middle
But this requires that both
windows are flexible in terms

00:17:43.256 --> 00:17:45.496 A:middle
of how small and large
they can be sized

00:17:45.966 --> 00:17:47.366 A:middle
to prevent the conflict
situations

00:17:47.406 --> 00:17:48.586 A:middle
that Corbin talked
about earlier.

00:17:49.806 --> 00:17:52.736 A:middle
This can be particularly tight
on the smaller display sizes

00:17:52.956 --> 00:17:54.236 A:middle
such as the new Retina MacBook.

00:17:55.006 --> 00:17:58.586 A:middle
This has a default resolution
of 1280 by 800 points.

00:17:59.426 --> 00:18:00.616 A:middle
Meaning that while
in split view,



00:17:59.426 --> 00:18:00.616 A:middle
Meaning that while
in split view,

00:18:01.086 --> 00:18:04.106 A:middle
each window is approximately
allocated 638 points

00:18:04.226 --> 00:18:05.046 A:middle
when divided equally.

00:18:05.996 --> 00:18:08.026 A:middle
If your application's minimum
width is currently larger

00:18:08.026 --> 00:18:10.866 A:middle
than this, users of these
display sizes are often not

00:18:10.866 --> 00:18:12.456 A:middle
going to be able to
tile your applications.

00:18:13.736 --> 00:18:17.016 A:middle
So I'm going to talk about four
techniques that you can use

00:18:17.086 --> 00:18:19.566 A:middle
to make sure your windows
behave nicely in Full Screen.

00:18:20.386 --> 00:18:22.636 A:middle
First, there's using Auto
Layout and priorities.

00:18:23.516 --> 00:18:26.296 A:middle
Second is the new sidebar
behavior with autocollapsing.

00:18:27.336 --> 00:18:30.186 A:middle
Then is using NSStackView
to easily build portions

00:18:30.186 --> 00:18:32.676 A:middle
of your interface with
flexibility built right in.

00:18:33.686 --> 00:18:35.926 A:middle
And finally, the
updated NSCollectionView

00:18:35.926 --> 00:18:37.606 A:middle
with its new powerful
layout support.

00:18:39.656 --> 00:18:43.296 A:middle
So Auto Layout is a
constraint-based layout system

00:18:43.296 --> 00:18:45.896 A:middle
we introduced in OS
X Lion and iOS 6.

00:18:46.336 --> 00:18:47.786 A:middle
It lets you declare
the relationships

00:18:47.786 --> 00:18:49.956 A:middle
between different UI
elements, such as the spacing

00:18:49.956 --> 00:18:51.386 A:middle
between them or their alignment.

00:18:51.386 --> 00:18:53.686 A:middle
And this is really powerful.

00:18:53.686 --> 00:18:55.366 A:middle
Windows views are
dynamically resized,

00:18:55.626 --> 00:18:56.766 A:middle
such as with localization.

00:18:57.826 --> 00:18:59.806 A:middle
You can establish priorities
between those constraints

00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:01.836 A:middle
so that stronger ones
can override weaker ones.



00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:01.836 A:middle
so that stronger ones
can override weaker ones.

00:19:02.026 --> 00:19:04.866 A:middle
I'm not going to go into
too many details about this.

00:19:04.866 --> 00:19:06.456 A:middle
There were two talks
earlier today,

00:19:06.456 --> 00:19:08.046 A:middle
Mysteries of Auto
Layout Part One and Two

00:19:08.366 --> 00:19:10.176 A:middle
that whether you're new or
experienced with Auto Layout,

00:19:10.176 --> 00:19:11.236 A:middle
had some really great content.

00:19:12.226 --> 00:19:13.806 A:middle
Instead, I want to
focus on priorities

00:19:14.116 --> 00:19:14.846 A:middle
through this example UI.

00:19:14.846 --> 00:19:18.956 A:middle
We have a label centered in
the middle with buttons pinned

00:19:18.956 --> 00:19:19.956 A:middle
to the left and right sides.

00:19:19.956 --> 00:19:21.786 A:middle
And these might be the
horizontal constraints

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:22.866 A:middle
that you'd use to create that.

00:19:23.636 --> 00:19:26.316 A:middle
With just these constraints, if
the view is dynamically sized,

00:19:26.826 --> 00:19:27.936 A:middle
you could end up
with this overlap

00:19:27.936 --> 00:19:29.386 A:middle
between the label
and the wide button.

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:31.246 A:middle
It's pretty easy to fix.

00:19:31.476 --> 00:19:32.906 A:middle
You'd add a minimum
spacing constraint

00:19:32.996 --> 00:19:34.106 A:middle
between that button
and the label.

00:19:34.756 --> 00:19:36.206 A:middle
And now when the
container's resized,

00:19:36.496 --> 00:19:38.696 A:middle
it can only resize far enough
to where it can satisfy both

00:19:38.696 --> 00:19:40.986 A:middle
that center alignment
and that minimum spacing.

00:19:40.986 --> 00:19:44.576 A:middle
This is a perfect layout,
except it'd be great

00:19:44.576 --> 00:19:46.286 A:middle
if this view can become
even more compact,

00:19:46.736 --> 00:19:47.806 A:middle
eliminating that white space

00:19:47.806 --> 00:19:49.476 A:middle
between the thin
button and the label.

00:19:50.966 --> 00:19:53.586 A:middle
Going back, we can make this
center alignment constraint be

00:19:53.586 --> 00:19:56.746 A:middle
optional, meaning it can be
broken by stronger constraints.

00:19:57.556 --> 00:19:59.676 A:middle
In addition, we'll add a minimum
spacing between the label

00:19:59.676 --> 00:20:02.666 A:middle
and the thin button to prevent
overlapping on that side.



00:19:59.676 --> 00:20:02.666 A:middle
and the thin button to prevent
overlapping on that side.

00:20:03.156 --> 00:20:05.646 A:middle
This time, the label is
centered as long as possible

00:20:05.966 --> 00:20:07.616 A:middle
up until it hits
that minimum padding.

00:20:07.616 --> 00:20:11.126 A:middle
And if we continue to resize
the container, we can break

00:20:11.126 --> 00:20:12.886 A:middle
that centering in order
to squeeze the most

00:20:12.886 --> 00:20:14.866 A:middle
out of our layout,
up to the point

00:20:14.866 --> 00:20:17.496 A:middle
to where we satisfy the
minimum padding on both sides.

00:20:18.966 --> 00:20:20.246 A:middle
You can get this
for your constraints

00:20:20.246 --> 00:20:21.516 A:middle
by just setting the
Priority property.

00:20:21.516 --> 00:20:24.186 A:middle
And this is also exposed
through Interface Builder.

00:20:25.736 --> 00:20:27.746 A:middle
By default, constraints
are required,

00:20:27.926 --> 00:20:29.166 A:middle
meaning they must be satisfied.

00:20:29.166 --> 00:20:32.136 A:middle
But anything lower than that and
the constraint becomes optional.

00:20:32.936 --> 00:20:35.076 A:middle
We have some key points to help
you decide what priority your

00:20:35.076 --> 00:20:35.916 A:middle
constraint should be.

00:20:36.746 --> 00:20:38.626 A:middle
There's Default Low,
which is a priority

00:20:38.626 --> 00:20:40.416 A:middle
at which your constraint
is typically weaker

00:20:40.416 --> 00:20:41.216 A:middle
than most others.

00:20:42.226 --> 00:20:43.756 A:middle
There's Drag That
Cannot Resize Window,

00:20:43.806 --> 00:20:45.166 A:middle
which is the specific priority

00:20:45.166 --> 00:20:47.386 A:middle
at which a split view
divider is dragged at.

00:20:47.726 --> 00:20:49.366 A:middle
If you want your constraint
to be more powerful

00:20:49.366 --> 00:20:51.346 A:middle
than this behavior, you'd
make your priority higher,

00:20:51.346 --> 00:20:52.646 A:middle
otherwise lower.

00:20:52.966 --> 00:20:54.996 A:middle
You'd typically never make
it this priority exactly.

00:20:56.306 --> 00:20:58.536 A:middle
There's also Windows Size Stay
Put, which is the priority

00:20:58.536 --> 00:21:00.156 A:middle
at which a window
holds its current size.



00:20:58.536 --> 00:21:00.156 A:middle
at which a window
holds its current size.

00:21:00.736 --> 00:21:03.796 A:middle
And finally, there's also
Drag That Can Resize Window,

00:21:03.796 --> 00:21:05.496 A:middle
which the priority at which
a window is dragged at.

00:21:05.496 --> 00:21:08.776 A:middle
But there's also Default High,
which is another general level

00:21:08.776 --> 00:21:10.566 A:middle
at which your constraint
is typically stronger

00:21:10.626 --> 00:21:11.976 A:middle
than most others.

00:21:12.536 --> 00:21:14.676 A:middle
So that's Auto Layout
priorities.

00:21:14.676 --> 00:21:17.046 A:middle
I'm going to refer back to
the concept of priorities

00:21:17.046 --> 00:21:18.086 A:middle
in a few later sections.

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:20.336 A:middle
But next I'm going to talk
about NSSplitViewController.

00:21:21.346 --> 00:21:23.226 A:middle
This is a Container View
Controller class we introduced

00:21:23.226 --> 00:21:23.836 A:middle
in Yosemite.

00:21:24.866 --> 00:21:27.266 A:middle
It allows your children
view controllers

00:21:27.266 --> 00:21:28.976 A:middle
to be arranged inside
of an NSSplitView

00:21:29.396 --> 00:21:31.536 A:middle
and exposes the notion
of NSSplitView items,

00:21:31.676 --> 00:21:32.826 A:middle
which encapsulates state

00:21:32.826 --> 00:21:34.596 A:middle
about those children
while in the split view.

00:21:35.236 --> 00:21:36.706 A:middle
These are things like
the holding priority,

00:21:37.046 --> 00:21:39.466 A:middle
the collapse state, and it
allows a really easy way

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:40.686 A:middle
to get animated collapses.

00:21:41.866 --> 00:21:44.576 A:middle
Last year's talk Storyboard and
Controllers on OS X talked more

00:21:44.576 --> 00:21:46.436 A:middle
about this and other
view controller features.

00:21:46.436 --> 00:21:49.176 A:middle
But I want to focus on
what's new in OS X v11.

00:21:50.146 --> 00:21:52.556 A:middle
First is the explicit
concept of sidebars

00:21:52.556 --> 00:21:54.266 A:middle
and the special behavior
that that comes with,

00:21:55.266 --> 00:21:57.236 A:middle
as well as spring loading,
which is the behavior

00:21:57.236 --> 00:22:00.066 A:middle
when an item is dragged within
a split view that can occur,



00:21:57.236 --> 00:22:00.066 A:middle
when an item is dragged within
a split view that can occur,

00:22:00.396 --> 00:22:02.156 A:middle
as well as several new metrics

00:22:02.156 --> 00:22:06.136 A:middle
which let you declare exactly
how your split view behaves

00:22:06.526 --> 00:22:07.376 A:middle
during resizes.

00:22:08.646 --> 00:22:11.206 A:middle
To go through an example,
here's the sidebar in Safari.

00:22:11.896 --> 00:22:14.896 A:middle
As the window is resized, once
it hits a point, there's a point

00:22:14.896 --> 00:22:16.436 A:middle
at which the sidebar
will autocollapse,

00:22:16.606 --> 00:22:19.366 A:middle
and if it's explicitly
reshown while in Full Screen,

00:22:19.366 --> 00:22:21.856 A:middle
it will overlay on top of
the other window content.

00:22:22.536 --> 00:22:25.006 A:middle
This is transient, similar to
popovers, so clicking outside

00:22:25.006 --> 00:22:26.906 A:middle
of it will autodismiss it.

00:22:27.456 --> 00:22:29.036 A:middle
This is really easy to get.

00:22:29.036 --> 00:22:31.416 A:middle
You just have to use the sidebar
with view controller constructor

00:22:31.616 --> 00:22:34.736 A:middle
on NSSplitViewItem, or
by sending the behavior

00:22:34.736 --> 00:22:36.296 A:middle
to sidebar in Interface Builder.

00:22:36.356 --> 00:22:39.146 A:middle
This will give you back a split
view item that you can then add

00:22:39.246 --> 00:22:40.246 A:middle
to your split view controller.

00:22:40.246 --> 00:22:42.046 A:middle
And it comes with
some special behaviors

00:22:42.546 --> 00:22:44.596 A:middle
such as the built-in
translucent material background

00:22:44.596 --> 00:22:47.186 A:middle
and vibrant divider that will
be introduced in Yosemite.

00:22:47.786 --> 00:22:48.736 A:middle
You no longer have to add

00:22:48.736 --> 00:22:50.636 A:middle
in your own visual effect
view to get this effect.

00:22:50.866 --> 00:22:53.306 A:middle
NSSplitViewItem will add
and manage that all for you.

00:22:54.636 --> 00:22:56.046 A:middle
There's also the autocollapse

00:22:56.046 --> 00:22:58.146 A:middle
and autouncollapse
behavior that you just saw.

00:22:58.286 --> 00:23:00.526 A:middle
And with that, the overlays
will in Full Screen.



00:22:58.286 --> 00:23:00.526 A:middle
And with that, the overlays
will in Full Screen.

00:23:01.916 --> 00:23:03.916 A:middle
In addition, a default several
of the other properties,

00:23:03.916 --> 00:23:05.336 A:middle
the standard value for sidebars.

00:23:05.696 --> 00:23:08.296 A:middle
So your sidebar behaved just
like the rest on the system.

00:23:09.706 --> 00:23:11.376 A:middle
With this there's also
a new action method

00:23:11.376 --> 00:23:13.476 A:middle
on split view controller,
toggle sidebar,

00:23:13.476 --> 00:23:15.636 A:middle
which will animatedly collapse

00:23:15.636 --> 00:23:17.576 A:middle
or uncollapse the first
sidebar it contains.

00:23:18.526 --> 00:23:20.746 A:middle
This way, writing no lines
of code, you can hook

00:23:20.746 --> 00:23:26.196 A:middle
to a menu item to have this
effect, or a toolbar button.

00:23:26.336 --> 00:23:28.226 A:middle
Another really cool
behavior is spring loading.

00:23:28.806 --> 00:23:31.196 A:middle
This happens when a user
has a collapsed pane on one

00:23:31.196 --> 00:23:32.286 A:middle
of the edges of your split view,

00:23:32.576 --> 00:23:34.796 A:middle
and they drag an item
over to that edge.

00:23:35.526 --> 00:23:38.146 A:middle
We'll translate, uncollapse
that sidebar and allow them

00:23:38.146 --> 00:23:40.456 A:middle
to interact with it and
then recollapse it once they

00:23:40.456 --> 00:23:40.966 A:middle
have finished.

00:23:41.446 --> 00:23:44.656 A:middle
You can get this by just
setting spring loaded to True

00:23:44.656 --> 00:23:46.916 A:middle
in your split view item, and
you'll get this behavior.

00:23:46.916 --> 00:23:49.816 A:middle
And this applies to both
sidebars and non-sidebars.

00:23:50.156 --> 00:23:50.656 A:middle
The difference being

00:23:50.656 --> 00:23:52.426 A:middle
that sidebars will
default this to True.

00:23:52.876 --> 00:23:54.626 A:middle
We believe that most sidebars
will want this behavior.

00:23:55.126 --> 00:23:58.586 A:middle
Next I want to talk about
several new metrics that we have

00:23:58.726 --> 00:24:00.436 A:middle
on NSSplitViewItem
and controller.



00:23:58.726 --> 00:24:00.436 A:middle
on NSSplitViewItem
and controller.

00:24:00.436 --> 00:24:02.116 A:middle
I'm going to go through
them a couple at a time.

00:24:03.686 --> 00:24:05.886 A:middle
First are minimum thickness
and maximum thickness.

00:24:06.246 --> 00:24:07.766 A:middle
These directly relate
to constraints

00:24:07.766 --> 00:24:09.726 A:middle
that the split view item
is managing on itself.

00:24:10.276 --> 00:24:13.276 A:middle
They describe how large or small
this item can actually get.

00:24:14.016 --> 00:24:15.976 A:middle
Sidebars will default
these to standard values.

00:24:16.276 --> 00:24:17.496 A:middle
But this is a really
convenient way

00:24:17.736 --> 00:24:20.626 A:middle
to set these constraints
up for yourself.

00:24:22.076 --> 00:24:25.156 A:middle
Holding priority is the only
non-new metric in OS X v11.

00:24:25.156 --> 00:24:26.976 A:middle
It describes the priority

00:24:26.976 --> 00:24:29.006 A:middle
at which a split view items
holds its current size.

00:24:29.636 --> 00:24:31.386 A:middle
In this example,
sidebar is default

00:24:31.386 --> 00:24:33.716 A:middle
to a slightly higher value, so
it means they're less likely

00:24:33.716 --> 00:24:35.386 A:middle
to resize than other items.

00:24:36.236 --> 00:24:38.206 A:middle
So as an example, when
it resizes this window,

00:24:38.316 --> 00:24:40.346 A:middle
all of that resize weight
goes to the content area,

00:24:40.346 --> 00:24:42.316 A:middle
and the sidebar stays
the same width.

00:24:43.876 --> 00:24:45.166 A:middle
Going back, you might
also set this

00:24:45.166 --> 00:24:46.806 A:middle
up to have equal
holding priorities

00:24:46.916 --> 00:24:48.016 A:middle
between the two items.

00:24:48.726 --> 00:24:50.756 A:middle
If you're familiar with Auto
Layout, you might recognize this

00:24:50.756 --> 00:24:51.976 A:middle
as an ambiguous situation.

00:24:52.486 --> 00:24:54.086 A:middle
But NSSplitView treats
this specially.

00:24:55.026 --> 00:24:55.996 A:middle
This time when you resize it,

00:24:56.446 --> 00:24:58.436 A:middle
the two views sized
proportionally according

00:24:58.436 --> 00:25:00.796 A:middle
to how large they were
before the resize.



00:24:58.436 --> 00:25:00.796 A:middle
to how large they were
before the resize.

00:25:01.066 --> 00:25:02.806 A:middle
So both views get sized
a little bit larger.

00:25:03.286 --> 00:25:05.326 A:middle
That's holding priority.

00:25:05.566 --> 00:25:08.466 A:middle
The next metric is
preferred thickness fraction.

00:25:08.926 --> 00:25:11.306 A:middle
This describes the ideal
percentage of the split view

00:25:11.306 --> 00:25:12.696 A:middle
that a split view
item wants to be in.

00:25:13.366 --> 00:25:15.596 A:middle
For instance, sidebars
will default to 15 percent.

00:25:16.386 --> 00:25:19.046 A:middle
When the user enters Full Screen
or double-clicks on the divider,

00:25:19.046 --> 00:25:21.716 A:middle
that item will snap to
that preferred thickness.

00:25:21.936 --> 00:25:23.286 A:middle
It's a really easy way
for them to get back

00:25:23.286 --> 00:25:24.106 A:middle
to that standard value.

00:25:25.446 --> 00:25:28.186 A:middle
Automatic maximum thickness
comes into play to act as a cap

00:25:28.266 --> 00:25:30.196 A:middle
for all of these
automatic sizing behaviors.

00:25:30.616 --> 00:25:32.926 A:middle
If that 15 percent was
going to correspond to 350,

00:25:32.926 --> 00:25:35.346 A:middle
it would instead
be capped at 280.

00:25:37.236 --> 00:25:39.396 A:middle
Those are all of the
NSSplitViewItem metrics.

00:25:39.746 --> 00:25:41.606 A:middle
There's one more metric
on NSSplitViewController,

00:25:41.916 --> 00:25:44.216 A:middle
which is minimum thickness
for inline sidebars.

00:25:44.986 --> 00:25:47.106 A:middle
This describes the width
at which the sidebars

00:25:47.106 --> 00:25:48.916 A:middle
in your split view
controller will autocollapse.

00:25:49.546 --> 00:25:51.436 A:middle
So sizing right up to that
will leave them inline.

00:25:51.436 --> 00:25:54.546 A:middle
And any further will
collapse your sidebar.

00:25:55.176 --> 00:25:57.116 A:middle
This also applies
while in Full Screen,

00:25:57.636 --> 00:25:59.646 A:middle
except the key difference
is that when in Full Screen

00:25:59.646 --> 00:26:02.176 A:middle
if it's explicitly reshown,
it shows as that overlay.



00:25:59.646 --> 00:26:02.176 A:middle
if it's explicitly reshown,
it shows as that overlay.

00:26:03.176 --> 00:26:05.146 A:middle
This illustrates an important
concept in Full Screen,

00:26:05.146 --> 00:26:07.546 A:middle
where we want to avoid
running the window

00:26:07.636 --> 00:26:09.286 A:middle
to prevent possible
conflicts with the neighbor.

00:26:09.916 --> 00:26:11.926 A:middle
It's always better to
try to rearrange contents

00:26:11.926 --> 00:26:14.506 A:middle
within your window
than growing it.

00:26:15.756 --> 00:26:17.486 A:middle
To support some of
these new features

00:26:17.676 --> 00:26:19.936 A:middle
in NSSplitViewController,
we've made some enhancements

00:26:19.936 --> 00:26:23.136 A:middle
to NSSplitView, specifically
with the arranged subviews.

00:26:24.356 --> 00:26:26.906 A:middle
Before El Capitan,
all the subviews

00:26:26.906 --> 00:26:28.716 A:middle
in a split view were
treated as split panes.

00:26:30.116 --> 00:26:30.836 A:middle
This meant that the API

00:26:30.836 --> 00:26:33.076 A:middle
to manage this was just
the subview API inherited

00:26:33.076 --> 00:26:33.726 A:middle
from NSView.

00:26:33.726 --> 00:26:36.996 A:middle
And this is convenient but came
with two really big problems.

00:26:37.816 --> 00:26:39.966 A:middle
One is that you're not
able to add subviews

00:26:40.036 --> 00:26:41.776 A:middle
that you don't want
treated as split panes.

00:26:42.436 --> 00:26:43.916 A:middle
For instance, dividers.

00:26:44.196 --> 00:26:45.456 A:middle
Dividers just couldn't
be represented

00:26:45.456 --> 00:26:46.326 A:middle
by views with this model.

00:26:47.306 --> 00:26:49.686 A:middle
In addition, you can't
separate the Z-order

00:26:49.976 --> 00:26:51.516 A:middle
from the arranged
order of the subviews.

00:26:51.856 --> 00:26:55.276 A:middle
So your zero index subview is
both the leadingmost and lowest

00:26:55.276 --> 00:26:57.636 A:middle
in Z order, and there's
no way to separate that.

00:26:58.756 --> 00:27:01.306 A:middle
So now in X v11 you can
designate certain subviews



00:26:58.756 --> 00:27:01.306 A:middle
So now in X v11 you can
designate certain subviews

00:27:01.306 --> 00:27:03.956 A:middle
as being arranged by the
split view using new API

00:27:03.956 --> 00:27:05.076 A:middle
on NSSplitView.

00:27:05.636 --> 00:27:09.046 A:middle
This API exactly matches that
on NSStackView and UIStackView

00:27:09.356 --> 00:27:11.116 A:middle
for managing their
arranged subviews.

00:27:12.266 --> 00:27:14.196 A:middle
There's also this property,
Arranges All Subviews,

00:27:14.646 --> 00:27:15.836 A:middle
which by default is True,

00:27:16.256 --> 00:27:18.246 A:middle
meaning that your subviews
is still always identical

00:27:18.246 --> 00:27:20.656 A:middle
to arrange subviews,
matching that legacy behavior.

00:27:21.726 --> 00:27:24.976 A:middle
But even when you set this to
False, NSSplitView still ensures

00:27:24.976 --> 00:27:27.066 A:middle
that your subviews, that
your arranged subviews,

00:27:27.106 --> 00:27:29.146 A:middle
are always a subset of subviews.

00:27:29.786 --> 00:27:32.186 A:middle
For instance, if you add an
arranged subview that's not

00:27:32.186 --> 00:27:35.256 A:middle
already a subview, it'll
be added as one for you.

00:27:35.846 --> 00:27:39.716 A:middle
And finally, we encourage you
to begin using arranged subviews

00:27:39.746 --> 00:27:41.446 A:middle
and setting Arranges
All Subviews to False,

00:27:41.876 --> 00:27:44.646 A:middle
because when you do, NSSplitView
is now able to use views

00:27:44.646 --> 00:27:47.206 A:middle
to represent its dividers,
allowing for things

00:27:47.206 --> 00:27:50.486 A:middle
like vibrancy and special
window-dragging behaviors.

00:27:51.586 --> 00:27:53.346 A:middle
You can also control this
through Interface Builder,

00:27:53.456 --> 00:27:55.296 A:middle
using this Arranges
All Subviews checkbox.

00:27:55.946 --> 00:27:57.396 A:middle
Upgraded nibs will
have this checked

00:27:57.756 --> 00:27:58.836 A:middle
at do not legacy behavior.

00:27:59.276 --> 00:28:00.166 A:middle
But new split views dragged



00:27:59.276 --> 00:28:00.166 A:middle
But new split views dragged

00:28:00.166 --> 00:28:02.206 A:middle
out from the object library
will have this unchecked,

00:28:02.636 --> 00:28:04.366 A:middle
which is the behavior we
encourage going forward.

00:28:06.776 --> 00:28:09.166 A:middle
To help investigate problems
that you may be having

00:28:09.166 --> 00:28:10.066 A:middle
with your split view or trying

00:28:10.066 --> 00:28:11.506 A:middle
to understand how your
split view is working,

00:28:11.886 --> 00:28:14.266 A:middle
we've enhanced the debug
description to tell you things

00:28:14.266 --> 00:28:17.216 A:middle
like how it's performing its
layout and what it's using

00:28:17.216 --> 00:28:18.236 A:middle
to represent its dividers.

00:28:18.236 --> 00:28:20.926 A:middle
For the layout, there
are few possibilities,

00:28:21.226 --> 00:28:22.376 A:middle
but we recommend making sure

00:28:22.376 --> 00:28:23.916 A:middle
that your split view
is using constraints.

00:28:24.636 --> 00:28:26.536 A:middle
This allows it to simply
describe the relationships

00:28:26.536 --> 00:28:28.286 A:middle
between its split
panes and interact

00:28:28.286 --> 00:28:29.806 A:middle
with other constraints
you have in your window.

00:28:30.376 --> 00:28:34.256 A:middle
In addition, it'll allow for
automatic right-to-left flipping

00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:35.456 A:middle
of your split view panes.

00:28:36.116 --> 00:28:39.586 A:middle
And with that, we also
recommend that dividers begin

00:28:39.586 --> 00:28:41.816 A:middle
to be represented using views

00:28:41.816 --> 00:28:45.546 A:middle
for the reasons I
mentioned before.

00:28:45.546 --> 00:28:48.526 A:middle
To help figure out why
your split view may

00:28:48.566 --> 00:28:50.956 A:middle
or not be using constraints,
we've added this Debug Reason

00:28:50.956 --> 00:28:53.516 A:middle
For Layout mode, which will give
you a human-readable description

00:28:53.936 --> 00:28:55.816 A:middle
for why it is or isn't
using constraints.

00:28:56.726 --> 00:28:57.586 A:middle
The most common reason is

00:28:57.586 --> 00:28:59.326 A:middle
that the delegate is
overriding certain methods

00:28:59.376 --> 00:29:00.686 A:middle
that are incompatible
with Auto Layout.



00:28:59.376 --> 00:29:00.686 A:middle
that are incompatible
with Auto Layout.

00:29:00.686 --> 00:29:02.966 A:middle
And it'll tell you exactly
which ones those are.

00:29:03.986 --> 00:29:05.846 A:middle
Whether or not it's in a window
that's using Auto Layout will

00:29:05.846 --> 00:29:08.026 A:middle
also determine whether
it can use constraints.

00:29:08.646 --> 00:29:11.466 A:middle
And finally, if it's being
used by NSSplitViewController,

00:29:11.966 --> 00:29:13.556 A:middle
it's required to
use constraints.

00:29:14.076 --> 00:29:18.186 A:middle
And if you've ever tried to
debug some layout problem

00:29:18.186 --> 00:29:20.136 A:middle
with your split view and
printed out the constraints,

00:29:20.136 --> 00:29:21.976 A:middle
it probably looks
something like this.

00:29:22.546 --> 00:29:23.756 A:middle
It's pretty difficult to parse.

00:29:23.756 --> 00:29:25.706 A:middle
If you really want to understand
you have to draw a picture.

00:29:26.156 --> 00:29:28.526 A:middle
You can't quite tell which
constraints your app has added

00:29:28.646 --> 00:29:30.986 A:middle
versus which constraints
the framework has added.

00:29:31.536 --> 00:29:35.396 A:middle
In OS X v11, NSSplitView
now gives identifiers to all

00:29:35.396 --> 00:29:36.356 A:middle
of the constraints it adds.

00:29:36.356 --> 00:29:38.726 A:middle
So you can not only tell
which constraints it's using,

00:29:38.726 --> 00:29:40.466 A:middle
but what it's trying to
do with that constraint.

00:29:41.536 --> 00:29:42.236 A:middle
You can quickly tell

00:29:42.236 --> 00:29:44.026 A:middle
which constraints your
application's added,

00:29:44.556 --> 00:29:46.166 A:middle
or if there's some
weird sizing behavior

00:29:46.166 --> 00:29:48.486 A:middle
that you're not sure what's
going on, you can quickly see

00:29:48.486 --> 00:29:51.976 A:middle
which constraints
likely deal with that.

00:29:51.976 --> 00:29:53.626 A:middle
NSStackView has similar
identifiers

00:29:53.956 --> 00:29:55.036 A:middle
for each of its constraints.

00:29:55.036 --> 00:29:58.056 A:middle
I want to talk about
NSStackView now.

00:29:58.766 --> 00:30:00.906 A:middle
So this is a class we
introduced in Mavericks



00:29:58.766 --> 00:30:00.906 A:middle
So this is a class we
introduced in Mavericks

00:30:00.946 --> 00:30:02.906 A:middle
that makes it really
easy to create horizontal

00:30:02.906 --> 00:30:06.946 A:middle
or vertical stacks of views,
all using Auto Layout.

00:30:07.046 --> 00:30:08.786 A:middle
It's completely compatible
with other constraints you have

00:30:08.786 --> 00:30:10.856 A:middle
in your window, but
it manages all

00:30:10.856 --> 00:30:13.086 A:middle
of the constraints it
uses to create its stack.

00:30:13.086 --> 00:30:15.176 A:middle
So you can add or remove
views and not have to worry

00:30:15.176 --> 00:30:16.576 A:middle
about updating those
constraints.

00:30:17.486 --> 00:30:20.046 A:middle
It has built-in notions of
alignment and distribution,

00:30:20.046 --> 00:30:22.256 A:middle
so you can control how
your views are positioned

00:30:22.256 --> 00:30:24.446 A:middle
within the stack view,
as well as clipping

00:30:24.446 --> 00:30:26.846 A:middle
and attaching behaviors so
you can control what happens

00:30:26.846 --> 00:30:28.366 A:middle
when the stack views
try to make smaller

00:30:28.366 --> 00:30:29.726 A:middle
than the views it contains.

00:30:31.046 --> 00:30:33.166 A:middle
In addition, in X v11
we've made a series

00:30:33.166 --> 00:30:35.036 A:middle
of performance improvements,
decreasing the number

00:30:35.036 --> 00:30:36.736 A:middle
of constraints it
uses and moving

00:30:36.736 --> 00:30:39.606 A:middle
from using private internal
views to using NS layout guides.

00:30:40.256 --> 00:30:42.466 A:middle
And we've seen some pretty
great performance improvements.

00:30:43.706 --> 00:30:45.656 A:middle
Mysteries of Auto Layout
Part One talks about this

00:30:45.656 --> 00:30:48.296 A:middle
and the new UIStackView
on iOS as well

00:30:48.296 --> 00:30:49.926 A:middle
as the awesome new
Interface Builder support

00:30:49.926 --> 00:30:51.426 A:middle
that we now have.

00:30:51.426 --> 00:30:54.706 A:middle
I do want to focus on
the new distributions,

00:30:54.996 --> 00:30:57.166 A:middle
which describe how the stack
views are arranged along the

00:30:57.166 --> 00:30:58.246 A:middle
stacking axis.

00:30:58.916 --> 00:31:01.096 A:middle
You can set this with
the Distribution property



00:30:58.916 --> 00:31:01.096 A:middle
You can set this with
the Distribution property

00:31:01.176 --> 00:31:02.036 A:middle
on NSStackView.

00:31:02.136 --> 00:31:03.736 A:middle
I'm going to go through
illustrations

00:31:03.736 --> 00:31:05.006 A:middle
on how each one of these work.

00:31:06.076 --> 00:31:08.376 A:middle
So Gravity Areas matches
the pre-X v11 behavior,

00:31:08.376 --> 00:31:10.536 A:middle
where you can designate
certain views as being attracted

00:31:10.566 --> 00:31:11.706 A:middle
to certain edges
of the split view.

00:31:12.216 --> 00:31:14.196 A:middle
For horizontal, that's
leading, center, and training.

00:31:14.586 --> 00:31:16.276 A:middle
For vertical that's
top, center, and bottom.

00:31:16.276 --> 00:31:18.456 A:middle
So in this case as we
grow the stack view,

00:31:18.896 --> 00:31:22.126 A:middle
those views will tend
towards those edges.

00:31:22.346 --> 00:31:25.106 A:middle
Fill is a new behavior
where the views are required

00:31:25.106 --> 00:31:26.436 A:middle
to completely fill
the stack view.

00:31:26.516 --> 00:31:30.016 A:middle
And using other constraints,
you can determine how they grow

00:31:30.016 --> 00:31:31.006 A:middle
or distribute that size.

00:31:31.876 --> 00:31:35.446 A:middle
In this example, tiny has set
to the lowest tugging priority,

00:31:36.096 --> 00:31:37.156 A:middle
so as we grow the stack view,

00:31:37.356 --> 00:31:39.016 A:middle
it receives all of
the resize weight.

00:31:40.316 --> 00:31:41.566 A:middle
Fill Equally is similar,

00:31:41.566 --> 00:31:43.686 A:middle
except now stack view
is adding constraints

00:31:43.756 --> 00:31:45.486 A:middle
that prefers the views
to be equally sized.

00:31:46.216 --> 00:31:48.286 A:middle
In this case we're adding
even stronger constraints

00:31:48.346 --> 00:31:49.506 A:middle
to squeeze the stack view down,

00:31:49.506 --> 00:31:52.056 A:middle
and it can override these
equal filling constraints.

00:31:52.726 --> 00:31:53.846 A:middle
But as we grow the stack view,

00:31:54.236 --> 00:31:56.226 A:middle
those views will tend
towards that equal sizing.

00:31:56.836 --> 00:32:01.246 A:middle
Fill Proportionally is
similar, except here they grow



00:31:56.836 --> 00:32:01.246 A:middle
Fill Proportionally is
similar, except here they grow

00:32:01.246 --> 00:32:03.756 A:middle
in proportion to how big their
intrinsic content sizes are.

00:32:04.336 --> 00:32:06.386 A:middle
So in this case, the larger
views grow even larger,

00:32:06.456 --> 00:32:10.736 A:middle
and the smaller views
not so much.

00:32:10.956 --> 00:32:13.306 A:middle
Equal Spacing is a distribution
where it's the not views

00:32:13.306 --> 00:32:15.296 A:middle
that receive the
additional size,

00:32:15.566 --> 00:32:17.116 A:middle
but it's the spacing
between the views.

00:32:17.906 --> 00:32:20.546 A:middle
In this case, as we grow,
the spacing between the edges

00:32:20.666 --> 00:32:22.556 A:middle
of each of the views
are all made equivalent.

00:32:24.236 --> 00:32:27.046 A:middle
Equal Centering is
similar, except here,

00:32:27.506 --> 00:32:30.416 A:middle
it's not the spacing between
the edges of the views

00:32:30.766 --> 00:32:32.546 A:middle
but between the centers
of the views.

00:32:33.066 --> 00:32:35.566 A:middle
With these new distribution
behaviors,

00:32:35.566 --> 00:32:38.266 A:middle
we think you can use stack view
in even more places of your UI

00:32:38.266 --> 00:32:40.826 A:middle
and really benefit from
the things it brings.

00:32:42.316 --> 00:32:45.826 A:middle
Another aspect of stack views
is the clipping behaviors.

00:32:46.206 --> 00:32:48.996 A:middle
So by default, stack views
can be made larger or up

00:32:48.996 --> 00:32:51.486 A:middle
to the minimum size necessary
to contain all of their items.

00:32:52.246 --> 00:32:54.316 A:middle
But you can also set the
clipping resistance priority

00:32:54.416 --> 00:32:57.286 A:middle
to allow it to begin clipping
its contents at that priority.

00:32:57.976 --> 00:32:58.956 A:middle
So now we can actually be made,

00:32:58.956 --> 00:33:03.506 A:middle
the stack view be made
smaller than its container.



00:32:58.956 --> 00:33:03.506 A:middle
the stack view be made
smaller than its container.

00:33:03.586 --> 00:33:05.736 A:middle
Often you don't want this
partial clipping of the views,

00:33:05.736 --> 00:33:06.906 A:middle
but it would be better
for the views

00:33:06.906 --> 00:33:08.186 A:middle
to entirely be dropped off.

00:33:08.916 --> 00:33:11.266 A:middle
You can control this by
setting the visibility priority

00:33:11.266 --> 00:33:12.336 A:middle
for the different views.

00:33:13.056 --> 00:33:14.976 A:middle
The view at the lowest
visibility priority will be

00:33:14.976 --> 00:33:17.266 A:middle
completely dropped once
the stack view starts

00:33:17.296 --> 00:33:18.116 A:middle
to clip its views.

00:33:19.026 --> 00:33:21.776 A:middle
In this case, we're going to set
it in descending order so that

00:33:21.776 --> 00:33:23.236 A:middle
as the stack view
starts to clip a view,

00:33:23.236 --> 00:33:25.696 A:middle
it'll just completely
temporarily detach off.

00:33:26.406 --> 00:33:29.356 A:middle
So in this case, the six
is not visible anymore.

00:33:29.906 --> 00:33:32.716 A:middle
If the stack view
grows larger again,

00:33:32.716 --> 00:33:35.566 A:middle
it'll reattach those views as
there's enough size to fit them.

00:33:36.376 --> 00:33:37.986 A:middle
In addition, you
can get callbacks

00:33:38.326 --> 00:33:40.606 A:middle
for when this detaching
or reattaching happens.

00:33:40.686 --> 00:33:43.186 A:middle
So you can perhaps make
adjustments to other portions

00:33:43.186 --> 00:33:45.226 A:middle
of your [inaudible], such
as adding an overflow menu.

00:33:45.766 --> 00:33:49.006 A:middle
Next, I want to give
a quick overview

00:33:49.006 --> 00:33:50.636 A:middle
of the new updated
collection view,

00:33:50.746 --> 00:33:53.576 A:middle
which now has feature parity
with the UI collection view.

00:33:54.256 --> 00:33:55.806 A:middle
This includes reusability
of items

00:33:55.856 --> 00:33:57.606 A:middle
so you can have really
scalable presentations

00:33:57.606 --> 00:34:00.346 A:middle
of large collections with
items with section support.



00:33:57.606 --> 00:34:00.346 A:middle
of large collections with
items with section support.

00:34:01.246 --> 00:34:03.326 A:middle
In addition, there's some
really powerful layout support,

00:34:03.326 --> 00:34:05.876 A:middle
so your collection view behaves
great no matter what the size.

00:34:06.836 --> 00:34:08.446 A:middle
This includes built-in
grid layout,

00:34:08.856 --> 00:34:11.906 A:middle
flow layout that matches
iOS, as well the ability

00:34:11.906 --> 00:34:13.146 A:middle
to create your own
custom layouts.

00:34:13.835 --> 00:34:15.946 A:middle
Troy has an awesome talk
about this later today,

00:34:15.946 --> 00:34:16.976 A:middle
What's New in Collection View.

00:34:17.416 --> 00:34:20.346 A:middle
I really recommend
checking that out.

00:34:20.616 --> 00:34:22.626 A:middle
With this talk we also have
Sample Code associated.

00:34:23.926 --> 00:34:27.275 A:middle
It's a photo-browsing app that
shows off various features, API,

00:34:27.275 --> 00:34:29.335 A:middle
and behaviors that
Corbin and I talked about.

00:34:30.056 --> 00:34:31.966 A:middle
For instance, it shows up
different Full Screen API,

00:34:32.356 --> 00:34:33.626 A:middle
specifically the new tiling API.

00:34:33.626 --> 00:34:36.505 A:middle
We have this little standalone
window that's normally required

00:34:36.505 --> 00:34:39.286 A:middle
to be aspect-ratio sized
and isn't Full Screenable.

00:34:39.835 --> 00:34:41.426 A:middle
However, we have
made it tileable

00:34:41.656 --> 00:34:43.585 A:middle
with a custom layout
once it's in that tile.

00:34:45.096 --> 00:34:47.005 A:middle
It also uses the new split
view controller features,

00:34:47.005 --> 00:34:49.646 A:middle
such as the autocollapsing
sidebar with the overlay,

00:34:50.726 --> 00:34:51.876 A:middle
as well as NSStackView.

00:34:52.396 --> 00:34:55.366 A:middle
It creates this bottom
toolbar using zero constraints,

00:34:55.706 --> 00:34:56.716 A:middle
which is really, really awesome.

00:34:57.526 --> 00:34:59.056 A:middle
It also uses that
detaching behavior

00:34:59.396 --> 00:35:01.596 A:middle
so that it can be made
smaller than those items



00:34:59.396 --> 00:35:01.596 A:middle
so that it can be made
smaller than those items

00:35:02.056 --> 00:35:03.586 A:middle
and shows this little
overflow menu

00:35:03.586 --> 00:35:07.126 A:middle
so the user still
has access to them.

00:35:07.346 --> 00:35:09.816 A:middle
It also uses the
updated NSCollectionView

00:35:09.816 --> 00:35:13.266 A:middle
for this little grid of photos
that behaves really responsibly.

00:35:16.456 --> 00:35:19.936 A:middle
So Corbin took us through
the aspects of Full Screen,

00:35:20.216 --> 00:35:22.656 A:middle
such as how to adopt Full
Screen into our applications.

00:35:22.996 --> 00:35:25.686 A:middle
And using title bar accessory
reviews, to have those bars

00:35:25.686 --> 00:35:27.656 A:middle
that live beneath the
toolbar behave really great

00:35:27.656 --> 00:35:28.406 A:middle
in Full Screen.

00:35:29.406 --> 00:35:31.566 A:middle
In addition, he showed us some
of the Full Screen Tiling API

00:35:31.566 --> 00:35:32.966 A:middle
so that we can make sure

00:35:32.966 --> 00:35:35.626 A:middle
that our special case
windows behave properly while

00:35:35.626 --> 00:35:36.176 A:middle
in Full Screen.

00:35:37.556 --> 00:35:39.186 A:middle
And finally, some of the ways

00:35:39.186 --> 00:35:41.006 A:middle
to make sure our layouts
are really flexible,

00:35:41.006 --> 00:35:42.566 A:middle
especially in this
narrow environment,

00:35:43.376 --> 00:35:45.906 A:middle
such as using the new sidebars
with Split View Controller.

00:35:46.726 --> 00:35:49.086 A:middle
Auto Layout and NSStackView
to build flexibility

00:35:49.086 --> 00:35:50.446 A:middle
into other portions your UI.

00:35:51.286 --> 00:35:54.466 A:middle
And NSCollectionView, with its
really awesome layout support.

00:35:54.466 --> 00:35:58.056 A:middle
If you have any questions,
you can contact Paul Marcos.

00:35:58.146 --> 00:35:59.226 A:middle
He loves getting emails.



00:36:00.436 --> 00:36:02.116 A:middle
In addition, we have
some related sessions

00:36:02.116 --> 00:36:02.956 A:middle
that I mentioned earlier.

00:36:02.956 --> 00:36:05.586 A:middle
They're all passed now, but
you can catch them on video.

00:36:05.586 --> 00:36:08.516 A:middle
In addition, we have some
labs that are later today,

00:36:08.516 --> 00:36:10.946 A:middle
well currently ongoing, and will
be later on today and tomorrow

00:36:11.416 --> 00:36:12.216 A:middle
if you have any questions.

00:36:13.516 --> 00:36:14.506 A:middle
Have a great WWDC.

00:36:14.646 --> 00:36:15.436 A:middle
Enjoy the bash.

00:36:16.046 --> 00:36:16.436 A:middle
See you later.

00:36:18.516 --> 00:36:32.150 A:middle
[ Applause ]
