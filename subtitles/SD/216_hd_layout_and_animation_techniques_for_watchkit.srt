&gt;&gt; MIGUEL SANCHEZ:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:38.346 A:middle
Welcome session 216, Layout

00:00:38.346 --> 00:00:39.856 A:middle
and Animation Techniques
for WatchKit.

00:00:39.856 --> 00:00:42.086 A:middle
My name is Miguel Sanchez,
I'm a WatchKit engineer.

00:00:42.436 --> 00:00:45.696 A:middle
Later you will hear from
my colleague Tom Witkin.

00:00:47.236 --> 00:00:51.406 A:middle
So the agenda for today
is to give you an overview

00:00:51.406 --> 00:00:53.476 A:middle
of the layout fundamentals
of WatchKit.

00:00:54.206 --> 00:00:58.136 A:middle
I will be going into more detail
about how to use groups to set

00:00:58.136 --> 00:01:01.256 A:middle
up your complex layouts, and
then you will hear from Tom,



00:00:58.136 --> 00:01:01.256 A:middle
up your complex layouts, and
then you will hear from Tom,

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.736 A:middle
talking to you about animation
techniques existing already

00:01:04.736 --> 00:01:06.866 A:middle
in Watch OS 1, as well
as in the new APIs

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.246 A:middle
that we are introducing
in Watch OS 2.

00:01:09.976 --> 00:01:13.146 A:middle
So our target audience for
this talk is the whole range

00:01:13.146 --> 00:01:14.396 A:middle
of WatchKit developers,

00:01:14.396 --> 00:01:17.816 A:middle
people that haven't seen the
platform yet, and are learning

00:01:17.816 --> 00:01:19.186 A:middle
about the layout as well as --

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:23.976 A:middle
as well as those of you who have
already had experience with it.

00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:26.266 A:middle
So let's start with the
layout fundamentals.

00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:29.556 A:middle
The WatchKit layout model,

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:32.666 A:middle
I should say off the bat
is the same layout model

00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.686 A:middle
that we have since
WatchKit OS 1.

00:01:35.646 --> 00:01:37.906 A:middle
WatchKit and Watch OS q.

00:01:37.956 --> 00:01:42.326 A:middle
If you haven't used it yet, it's
a different model from the UIKit

00:01:42.326 --> 00:01:44.586 A:middle
and the AppKit models that you
may have had experiences with.

00:01:45.716 --> 00:01:49.076 A:middle
The difference is that in
WatchKit we are using a flow

00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:53.506 A:middle
based layout and what
I mean by that is,

00:01:53.836 --> 00:01:56.086 A:middle
you've probably seen
this animation before,

00:01:56.086 --> 00:01:58.456 A:middle
in Interface Builder,
you have your library of,

00:01:58.456 --> 00:02:00.476 A:middle
and your catalog
of WatchKit objects



00:01:58.456 --> 00:02:00.476 A:middle
and your catalog
of WatchKit objects

00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:03.316 A:middle
and you are dragging them
on to your controller.

00:02:04.046 --> 00:02:07.086 A:middle
As you are dragging
them, they are falling

00:02:07.086 --> 00:02:09.895 A:middle
on the next available
slot on the flow.

00:02:09.946 --> 00:02:11.956 A:middle
And that flow is
initially vertical.

00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:14.416 A:middle
So here you have
a second element.

00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:17.186 A:middle
It falls on its set
slot, and, of course,

00:02:17.186 --> 00:02:21.406 A:middle
you can add a horizontal flow if
you introduce a grouping object

00:02:21.406 --> 00:02:23.476 A:middle
and tell it to use
horizontal layout.

00:02:26.156 --> 00:02:29.266 A:middle
So some important
points as a programmer

00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:31.406 A:middle
of WatchKit applications is

00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:34.876 A:middle
that you are not writing
object creation code.

00:02:35.086 --> 00:02:38.056 A:middle
All of your UI creation is
happening in story boards

00:02:38.056 --> 00:02:39.066 A:middle
and Interface Builder.

00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:42.386 A:middle
We are not providing APIsor
allocating your typical

00:02:42.386 --> 00:02:43.266 A:middle
WatchKit objects.

00:02:44.446 --> 00:02:47.126 A:middle
This does not mean that you
don't have fine-tune control

00:02:47.126 --> 00:02:51.216 A:middle
of your layout hierarchies
and alignment and sizing,

00:02:51.216 --> 00:02:53.066 A:middle
as well as animation,
as you will see here.

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:56.006 A:middle
So we'll go into each
one of these in detail.

00:02:56.336 --> 00:02:58.876 A:middle
Let's start out with
alignment and sizing.



00:03:00.506 --> 00:03:01.706 A:middle
All of your instances

00:03:01.706 --> 00:03:06.136 A:middle
of WatchKit objects are
subclasses of WKInterfaceObject.

00:03:08.056 --> 00:03:11.546 A:middle
All of these have properties
for setting the alignment,

00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:14.046 A:middle
and the sizing heuristics.

00:03:14.176 --> 00:03:16.106 A:middle
So alignment, we are referring

00:03:16.106 --> 00:03:18.506 A:middle
to the alignment inside
the containing object.

00:03:19.306 --> 00:03:22.266 A:middle
This is the horizontal
and the vertical alignment

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:24.126 A:middle
and it can either be
left, center or right.

00:03:24.826 --> 00:03:29.456 A:middle
For sizing, you are telling us
what rules you want us to use

00:03:29.456 --> 00:03:33.356 A:middle
when sizing your objects both
width-wise and height-wise

00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:41.426 A:middle
and this is either fixed,
relative or sized to fit.

00:03:41.426 --> 00:03:45.796 A:middle
In Watch OS 2, these -- these
properties have been available

00:03:45.796 --> 00:03:48.686 A:middle
in Interface Builder since
Watch OS 1, but in Watch OS 2,

00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:50.966 A:middle
we are exposing more
of these through APIs.

00:03:51.796 --> 00:03:54.896 A:middle
We want to give you more
control in your code but also

00:03:54.896 --> 00:03:57.136 A:middle
to animate them as
you'll see later.

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:59.806 A:middle
This is a new API set horizontal

00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:03.776 A:middle
and vertical alignment
with new enum types.



00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:03.776 A:middle
and vertical alignment
with new enum types.

00:04:03.986 --> 00:04:05.576 A:middle
This does what you expect.

00:04:05.576 --> 00:04:08.146 A:middle
Here you have the world premier

00:04:08.146 --> 00:04:13.596 A:middle
of WK blue box doing a
left top alignment, center,

00:04:13.596 --> 00:04:15.716 A:middle
center, and right bottom.

00:04:16.946 --> 00:04:19.446 A:middle
On the sizing API side,

00:04:19.636 --> 00:04:22.046 A:middle
we already had said
width and said height.

00:04:22.806 --> 00:04:26.916 A:middle
For washWatch OS 2, we are
exposing the relative width

00:04:26.916 --> 00:04:29.276 A:middle
and the sizing to fit APIs.

00:04:29.366 --> 00:04:31.386 A:middle
Again, it gives you more
control in your code.

00:04:33.236 --> 00:04:35.156 A:middle
Graphically this looks
like the following:

00:04:35.606 --> 00:04:37.456 A:middle
so here's a fixed
width and height

00:04:37.876 --> 00:04:40.156 A:middle
of our blue square, once again.

00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:45.266 A:middle
If you have been using this
in the previous release,

00:04:45.806 --> 00:04:47.806 A:middle
you should know that
we interpret the value

00:04:47.806 --> 00:04:48.836 A:middle
of zero differently.

00:04:49.396 --> 00:04:52.946 A:middle
In Watch OS 1, if you give us
a zero in code, we revert it

00:04:52.946 --> 00:04:55.706 A:middle
to the storyboard
value, in Watch OS 2,

00:04:56.006 --> 00:04:58.916 A:middle
we are interpreting the zero
as an absolute zero value.

00:04:58.916 --> 00:04:59.976 A:middle
So just keep that in mind.



00:05:02.336 --> 00:05:06.646 A:middle
Let's say that you want to
size the rectangle to be 75%

00:05:06.646 --> 00:05:08.476 A:middle
of the width of the
containing element.

00:05:08.906 --> 00:05:12.806 A:middle
So you can use said relative
width, with a .75 value

00:05:12.806 --> 00:05:15.306 A:middle
and you get three-fourths
of the width.

00:05:15.306 --> 00:05:19.666 A:middle
And you can do the same for
the height, if you want it

00:05:19.666 --> 00:05:22.936 A:middle
to be half of the height
of your containing element.

00:05:24.256 --> 00:05:28.326 A:middle
The second parameter in these
APIs is an adjustment value,

00:05:28.726 --> 00:05:31.936 A:middle
which can be positive or
negative, and it's applied

00:05:31.936 --> 00:05:33.806 A:middle
after you do the initial sizing.

00:05:33.806 --> 00:05:37.246 A:middle
So in this case, I will
be adding 30 to the width

00:05:37.246 --> 00:05:41.196 A:middle
and subtracting 30 to the
height and I get the following.

00:05:42.186 --> 00:05:46.126 A:middle
And finally, the
sizing to fit and sizing

00:05:46.126 --> 00:05:49.046 A:middle
to height does what
you probably expect.

00:05:49.046 --> 00:05:51.316 A:middle
You know, depending on the
content inside your rectangle,

00:05:51.316 --> 00:05:53.836 A:middle
we are sizing appropriately.

00:05:55.246 --> 00:05:57.726 A:middle
Now, let's move on
to group elements.

00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:01.306 A:middle
This is where you really start
to fine tune your layout.



00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:01.306 A:middle
This is where you really start
to fine tune your layout.

00:06:02.056 --> 00:06:07.176 A:middle
WKInterfaceGroup, think of
it initially as a container

00:06:07.176 --> 00:06:08.576 A:middle
without default content.

00:06:08.806 --> 00:06:11.756 A:middle
It can have content as
I will illustrate later

00:06:12.076 --> 00:06:14.716 A:middle
but initially it's
just a container.

00:06:15.356 --> 00:06:18.296 A:middle
It's a tool for arranging
all of your elements.

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.006 A:middle
This is where you get the chance

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:23.806 A:middle
to pick whether you want a
vertical or horizontal layout.

00:06:25.256 --> 00:06:27.466 A:middle
This is also where you
start to introduce nesting.

00:06:29.216 --> 00:06:33.266 A:middle
And this is where you are
tweaking the alignment

00:06:33.266 --> 00:06:34.996 A:middle
and the sizing that
we just saw before

00:06:34.996 --> 00:06:36.306 A:middle
on the containing elements.

00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:40.776 A:middle
So as we saw in the first set
of slides, now I'm abstracting

00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:44.506 A:middle
to the blue shapes, you
are laying your interface

00:06:44.506 --> 00:06:46.966 A:middle
in Interface Builder and you
have the vertical layout.

00:06:48.486 --> 00:06:51.296 A:middle
You introduce a group and you
tell it in Interface Builder

00:06:51.296 --> 00:06:54.046 A:middle
that you want the horizontal
layout and you start laying

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:55.496 A:middle
out your objects there.

00:06:57.456 --> 00:06:59.746 A:middle
So once you have defined
your containment hierarchy,



00:07:00.816 --> 00:07:04.206 A:middle
you are able to define
things like insets

00:07:04.206 --> 00:07:05.706 A:middle
and spacings within your group.

00:07:06.486 --> 00:07:09.706 A:middle
So you can define
the left inset here.

00:07:09.706 --> 00:07:11.106 A:middle
These are point values.

00:07:11.896 --> 00:07:15.906 A:middle
Left inset, bottom inset, top
inset, right inset and right,

00:07:16.556 --> 00:07:21.346 A:middle
as well as the spacing that
is used to put aside --

00:07:21.346 --> 00:07:23.566 A:middle
to separate each one
of your elements.

00:07:24.906 --> 00:07:29.846 A:middle
Now, don't forget that your top
level container object is also

00:07:29.846 --> 00:07:30.666 A:middle
-- is also a group.

00:07:31.176 --> 00:07:33.646 A:middle
So you can set the
insets at that level,

00:07:34.976 --> 00:07:36.176 A:middle
as well as the spacing.

00:07:36.176 --> 00:07:38.686 A:middle
So we use the same spacing
for the number of elements

00:07:38.686 --> 00:07:39.736 A:middle
that you have inside
of your group.

00:07:39.736 --> 00:07:42.556 A:middle
So here you have a
spacing of 10 that is used

00:07:42.556 --> 00:07:46.326 A:middle
for the three top level
elements in your group.

00:07:47.296 --> 00:07:49.946 A:middle
Now, once you apply -- once
you start using nesting,

00:07:50.266 --> 00:07:52.736 A:middle
you are able to achieve
your complex layouts.

00:07:52.736 --> 00:07:54.226 A:middle
Here's a very simple example.

00:07:54.696 --> 00:07:57.176 A:middle
If you want the two squares
stacked on top of each other,

00:07:57.176 --> 00:07:59.666 A:middle
followed by two squares
right next to each other,



00:08:00.066 --> 00:08:04.466 A:middle
you first use a group
with a vertical layout.

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:07.046 A:middle
Then you use another group
with a horizontal layout

00:08:07.046 --> 00:08:09.646 A:middle
and you wrap those
two in another group

00:08:09.646 --> 00:08:11.886 A:middle
because that's the way you
achieve the horizontal layout

00:08:11.886 --> 00:08:12.906 A:middle
of those two elements.

00:08:13.406 --> 00:08:17.146 A:middle
And by default, there's
no content in your groups.

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:19.846 A:middle
So they are transparent and
you only see your squares.

00:08:21.336 --> 00:08:24.816 A:middle
Now, let's make this more
concrete with an example

00:08:24.816 --> 00:08:27.246 A:middle
that I will be introducing
in this part of the session

00:08:27.246 --> 00:08:30.186 A:middle
and then Tom will
start animating.

00:08:30.696 --> 00:08:31.806 A:middle
So we have WKRecipes.

00:08:32.015 --> 00:08:33.796 A:middle
This is a very simple
recipe viewer.

00:08:34.316 --> 00:08:35.395 A:middle
It lists your recipes.

00:08:36.416 --> 00:08:38.546 A:middle
Fish tacos, pizza,
barbecue wings.

00:08:40.275 --> 00:08:42.785 A:middle
You can see the list of
ingredients for each one

00:08:42.785 --> 00:08:46.076 A:middle
of your recipes, and you can
see the number of servings

00:08:46.076 --> 00:08:47.226 A:middle
for each one of the recipes.

00:08:47.716 --> 00:08:50.326 A:middle
And there are other
screens which Tom will talk

00:08:50.326 --> 00:08:51.846 A:middle
about in the context
of animation.

00:08:52.116 --> 00:08:54.716 A:middle
For here, we are focusing
on the static layout

00:08:54.716 --> 00:08:56.066 A:middle
of these three elements.

00:08:56.866 --> 00:08:57.816 A:middle
So how do we do this?

00:08:58.956 --> 00:09:02.826 A:middle
The first screen that we
see is a table of recipes.



00:08:58.956 --> 00:09:02.826 A:middle
The first screen that we
see is a table of recipes.

00:09:02.946 --> 00:09:06.456 A:middle
So in WatchKit, you have a table
controller that you can use

00:09:06.486 --> 00:09:09.176 A:middle
to layout your rows, but
it's your responsibility

00:09:09.176 --> 00:09:10.876 A:middle
to tell us what each
row looks like.

00:09:12.006 --> 00:09:13.666 A:middle
What is the structure of that?

00:09:13.666 --> 00:09:16.806 A:middle
So here we want an
image and a label.

00:09:18.306 --> 00:09:20.376 A:middle
So we have a horizontal layout,

00:09:20.376 --> 00:09:22.966 A:middle
that should automatically
tell you that that's a group

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:25.306 A:middle
with a horizontal layout.

00:09:27.376 --> 00:09:30.426 A:middle
Then you have defined your
containment hierarchy,

00:09:30.426 --> 00:09:32.446 A:middle
and now you are going
to define your spacings.

00:09:32.446 --> 00:09:33.746 A:middle
So you have your left inset,

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:37.736 A:middle
your bottom, top,
and the spacing.

00:09:39.486 --> 00:09:40.246 A:middle
And your alignment.

00:09:41.186 --> 00:09:45.266 A:middle
Right? Your image is
aligned center, vertically,

00:09:45.776 --> 00:09:50.386 A:middle
but it's aligned to the left in
the next slot that it falls on.

00:09:50.716 --> 00:09:53.026 A:middle
And the label also has
a vertical alignment

00:09:53.026 --> 00:09:53.956 A:middle
but left aligned.

00:09:54.046 --> 00:09:57.116 A:middle
Notice that it's left aligned in
the slot that it corresponds to,

00:09:57.116 --> 00:10:01.066 A:middle
right, because there's an image
before it, so right next to it.



00:09:57.116 --> 00:10:01.066 A:middle
right, because there's an image
before it, so right next to it.

00:10:02.286 --> 00:10:04.386 A:middle
Sizing our images are square.

00:10:04.846 --> 00:10:05.486 A:middle
Resources.

00:10:05.486 --> 00:10:09.076 A:middle
So we have a fixed size
of 30 points on each side.

00:10:10.056 --> 00:10:14.836 A:middle
And the label, obviously
sizes to fit.

00:10:15.276 --> 00:10:20.816 A:middle
So table row layouts show us
that we can use the groups

00:10:20.816 --> 00:10:24.516 A:middle
for horizontal sizing, and then
we can fine tune our alignments,

00:10:24.516 --> 00:10:25.656 A:middle
and set some spacing.

00:10:26.306 --> 00:10:29.726 A:middle
Now, let's move on to the
ingredients controller.

00:10:30.546 --> 00:10:33.526 A:middle
Some of you might be
noticing that five hot sauce,

00:10:33.526 --> 00:10:36.186 A:middle
whatever units that is, is
probably too much hot sauce

00:10:36.186 --> 00:10:39.826 A:middle
for any taco recipe, but that's
the wrong thing to focus on.

00:10:42.356 --> 00:10:43.456 A:middle
You actually want to notice

00:10:43.456 --> 00:10:47.146 A:middle
that although we have our
table layout, we have rows,

00:10:47.786 --> 00:10:49.306 A:middle
we now have the circle element.

00:10:49.526 --> 00:10:51.486 A:middle
How do we achieve this?

00:10:52.096 --> 00:10:54.486 A:middle
The horizontal layout
is the same.

00:10:54.486 --> 00:10:55.376 A:middle
We still have a group.

00:10:55.816 --> 00:10:58.836 A:middle
We have the label, obviously,

00:10:58.836 --> 00:11:01.936 A:middle
but what is that red
circle on the top left?



00:10:58.836 --> 00:11:01.936 A:middle
but what is that red
circle on the top left?

00:11:03.156 --> 00:11:05.076 A:middle
We can nest groups,
as I said before.

00:11:05.076 --> 00:11:06.386 A:middle
So we are using a group here.

00:11:07.196 --> 00:11:10.506 A:middle
And here we are now
moving into the area

00:11:10.506 --> 00:11:13.946 A:middle
where groups do have
backgrounds.

00:11:13.996 --> 00:11:16.536 A:middle
They don't have default content,
but they can have backgrounds.

00:11:16.656 --> 00:11:19.576 A:middle
The backgrounds can be
either colors or images.

00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:22.386 A:middle
So we can select the
image of this group,

00:11:22.576 --> 00:11:26.856 A:middle
as well as the radius that is
used to draw the background.

00:11:26.856 --> 00:11:30.866 A:middle
And so we are setting a group
with a colored background,

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:34.906 A:middle
blue in the schematic, red in
the real example with a radius

00:11:34.906 --> 00:11:38.926 A:middle
of 8 and then you get
the nice blue circle.

00:11:39.476 --> 00:11:42.476 A:middle
Once you have a group, you
can nest the label inside it

00:11:42.476 --> 00:11:44.276 A:middle
and it's centered in the group.

00:11:44.276 --> 00:11:46.216 A:middle
Now you have the horizontal
and the vertical centering

00:11:46.216 --> 00:11:49.156 A:middle
so this is where you start to
see the building of concepts

00:11:49.156 --> 00:11:50.726 A:middle
that we have been talking about.

00:11:53.016 --> 00:11:55.786 A:middle
And yet again, sorry
to be repetitive,

00:11:55.786 --> 00:11:56.786 A:middle
but this is the model.

00:11:56.786 --> 00:12:00.076 A:middle
Now you define -- you
find tune your left inset,



00:11:56.786 --> 00:12:00.076 A:middle
Now you define -- you
find tune your left inset,

00:12:00.126 --> 00:12:04.696 A:middle
top, bottom, and spacing.

00:12:06.276 --> 00:12:11.426 A:middle
So remember, for nested
groups, you can use nesting

00:12:11.496 --> 00:12:16.556 A:middle
to achieve complex layouts,
as well as using backgrounds

00:12:16.556 --> 00:12:20.306 A:middle
within your groups whether
that's a color, or an image.

00:12:22.726 --> 00:12:24.996 A:middle
Lastly, we have the
servings controller,

00:12:24.996 --> 00:12:27.786 A:middle
which it highlights
the number --

00:12:27.786 --> 00:12:30.686 A:middle
it's a circle that highlights
the number of servings,

00:12:31.086 --> 00:12:33.126 A:middle
four in this example, for
your particular recipe.

00:12:34.046 --> 00:12:35.496 A:middle
So some of you might
be thinking,

00:12:35.736 --> 00:12:37.206 A:middle
this is a circular layout.

00:12:37.206 --> 00:12:38.826 A:middle
How does this --
how is this achieved

00:12:38.826 --> 00:12:40.606 A:middle
in the grid-like flow layout

00:12:40.606 --> 00:12:42.726 A:middle
that you have been
talking about so far?

00:12:43.656 --> 00:12:47.066 A:middle
So we have a circle of 12 --

00:12:47.126 --> 00:12:51.186 A:middle
well, a circular pattern of 12
objects, but if we look at them

00:12:51.186 --> 00:12:55.816 A:middle
in detail, these are actually
just three top level groups.

00:12:57.336 --> 00:12:59.296 A:middle
So we have the first group,



00:13:00.306 --> 00:13:05.266 A:middle
the second group,
and the third group.

00:13:05.466 --> 00:13:08.986 A:middle
Inside of those groups, we
subsequently use more nesting.

00:13:09.076 --> 00:13:10.526 A:middle
So let's focus on
the middle group.

00:13:11.876 --> 00:13:13.556 A:middle
Sorry, let me talk about the --

00:13:13.616 --> 00:13:16.726 A:middle
at the top level groups we do
have alignment of the groups.

00:13:16.726 --> 00:13:21.186 A:middle
For example, the top group
is horizontally aligned

00:13:21.186 --> 00:13:23.346 A:middle
in the center and fixed size.

00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:28.016 A:middle
The middle one is
sized to fit --

00:13:28.046 --> 00:13:29.876 A:middle
to take up the whole
width of the container.

00:13:31.386 --> 00:13:36.906 A:middle
So now the second group has
more groups inside of it, right?

00:13:36.906 --> 00:13:38.906 A:middle
So we have a group
with vertical layout.

00:13:39.626 --> 00:13:41.556 A:middle
Then we have a group
with horizontal layout

00:13:41.556 --> 00:13:43.726 A:middle
and finally we have a third
group with horizontal --

00:13:44.026 --> 00:13:45.526 A:middle
with another vertical layout.

00:13:46.036 --> 00:13:47.586 A:middle
And if we look at
each one of those,

00:13:47.956 --> 00:13:50.676 A:middle
those themselves are made
up of more subgroups.

00:13:52.796 --> 00:13:55.596 A:middle
Once we have this
level of definition,

00:13:56.396 --> 00:13:59.366 A:middle
we can indicate the
alignment, the precise alignment

00:13:59.516 --> 00:14:00.816 A:middle
on each one of those circles.



00:13:59.516 --> 00:14:00.816 A:middle
on each one of those circles.

00:14:01.086 --> 00:14:02.426 A:middle
Now you can clearly see

00:14:02.426 --> 00:14:06.336 A:middle
that that circle is horizontally
aligned to the right

00:14:06.886 --> 00:14:08.546 A:middle
and vertically on the top.

00:14:09.796 --> 00:14:11.656 A:middle
Then you have the left
alignment and the center

00:14:11.656 --> 00:14:12.906 A:middle
for this particular circle.

00:14:13.736 --> 00:14:17.246 A:middle
And right bottom for
the other, right?

00:14:17.476 --> 00:14:20.876 A:middle
So you have seen how the
grid-like flow layout really

00:14:20.876 --> 00:14:23.396 A:middle
gives you a lot of
power in terms

00:14:23.576 --> 00:14:26.136 A:middle
of the things you can achieve
and that's the same pattern

00:14:26.136 --> 00:14:28.956 A:middle
that we follow for the whole
-- for the whole circle here.

00:14:29.646 --> 00:14:35.606 A:middle
So group nesting is your key
to achieving complex layouts.

00:14:36.856 --> 00:14:40.296 A:middle
Now that I have given you all of
this rope, I need to warn you,

00:14:40.526 --> 00:14:41.646 A:middle
don't hang yourself with it.

00:14:42.696 --> 00:14:46.046 A:middle
It is possible to
abuse groups, right?

00:14:46.046 --> 00:14:48.016 A:middle
You have to keep that in mind.

00:14:48.016 --> 00:14:50.926 A:middle
You can go overboard by
trying to nest everything.

00:14:51.556 --> 00:14:53.516 A:middle
So some things to keep in mind.

00:14:54.836 --> 00:14:56.436 A:middle
I can't give you
an exact number.

00:14:56.436 --> 00:14:58.626 A:middle
It depends on what
your backgrounds are

00:14:58.626 --> 00:15:02.776 A:middle
or how your layout is behaving,
but keep these things in mind.



00:14:58.626 --> 00:15:02.776 A:middle
or how your layout is behaving,
but keep these things in mind.

00:15:02.776 --> 00:15:05.026 A:middle
At the beginning of
the presentation,

00:15:05.026 --> 00:15:07.786 A:middle
I said that we are
not offering you APIs

00:15:07.786 --> 00:15:10.036 A:middle
for direct element
creation, or destruction.

00:15:11.336 --> 00:15:13.366 A:middle
This is all done
in the storyboards

00:15:13.366 --> 00:15:14.276 A:middle
and Interface Builder.

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:16.246 A:middle
So anything you create

00:15:16.246 --> 00:15:18.506 A:middle
in Interface Builder
is instantiated.

00:15:18.506 --> 00:15:19.306 A:middle
It's created.

00:15:19.446 --> 00:15:22.216 A:middle
When you're instantiating
one of your controllers,

00:15:22.416 --> 00:15:27.296 A:middle
you're instantiating all of
the elements inside of it.

00:15:27.716 --> 00:15:29.386 A:middle
It's possible to
hide some of them.

00:15:29.386 --> 00:15:31.206 A:middle
That's one of the properties
that you have for some

00:15:31.206 --> 00:15:34.176 A:middle
of the elements, but even
though they are hidden,

00:15:34.176 --> 00:15:36.926 A:middle
you are still -- we are
still creating them.

00:15:38.736 --> 00:15:40.426 A:middle
So you might -- you are
still taking the hit

00:15:40.426 --> 00:15:41.446 A:middle
of the creation costs.

00:15:41.676 --> 00:15:43.396 A:middle
You might save on
the layout costs

00:15:43.396 --> 00:15:44.726 A:middle
because we are not
doing the layout,

00:15:44.726 --> 00:15:46.266 A:middle
but the creation
is still happening.

00:15:46.706 --> 00:15:50.206 A:middle
So keep this in mind as you
start adding a bunch of objects

00:15:50.206 --> 00:15:51.296 A:middle
into your controllers, right?

00:15:51.296 --> 00:15:54.316 A:middle
Keep them -- in mind that those
are all being created even

00:15:54.316 --> 00:15:58.806 A:middle
if they are not visible
at that particular time.

00:15:59.136 --> 00:16:03.766 A:middle
And finally, as I showed you
with groups and their ability



00:15:59.136 --> 00:16:03.766 A:middle
And finally, as I showed you
with groups and their ability

00:16:03.766 --> 00:16:10.176 A:middle
to have images, keep in mind
that images have a transfer cost

00:16:10.176 --> 00:16:13.466 A:middle
over into your Apple Watch.

00:16:13.666 --> 00:16:17.266 A:middle
In Watch OS 1 apps, the
extension was running

00:16:17.266 --> 00:16:19.746 A:middle
on the phone, and
they have to get --

00:16:19.946 --> 00:16:22.896 A:middle
we have to get those images
over into your watch, right?

00:16:22.896 --> 00:16:26.166 A:middle
Each time your user is
using your interface.

00:16:26.166 --> 00:16:27.156 A:middle
So keep that in mind.

00:16:27.416 --> 00:16:30.506 A:middle
We have APIs for image
caching which we kind of --

00:16:30.826 --> 00:16:32.626 A:middle
you tell us to move a
certain set of images

00:16:32.626 --> 00:16:35.916 A:middle
but they still have to get
over the air to your watch.

00:16:36.656 --> 00:16:38.786 A:middle
In Watch OS 2, this
is less relevant

00:16:38.786 --> 00:16:40.886 A:middle
because the extension is
running on your watch,

00:16:41.476 --> 00:16:43.476 A:middle
but you still have
to install the app.

00:16:43.476 --> 00:16:45.736 A:middle
So you still have
a set of resources

00:16:45.736 --> 00:16:46.576 A:middle
that you are installing.

00:16:46.576 --> 00:16:49.156 A:middle
So there is still a
transfer cost for your users

00:16:49.156 --> 00:16:50.486 A:middle
from an installation
point of view.

00:16:52.236 --> 00:16:53.516 A:middle
So always remember

00:16:53.516 --> 00:16:55.806 A:middle
to use appropriate
sizes for your images.

00:16:56.486 --> 00:16:59.446 A:middle
If you give us an
image, we will resize it

00:16:59.446 --> 00:17:02.216 A:middle
for whatever you tell us
to display on the screen.



00:16:59.446 --> 00:17:02.216 A:middle
for whatever you tell us
to display on the screen.

00:17:03.286 --> 00:17:06.076 A:middle
But by doing, that you are
adding more processing cycles

00:17:06.286 --> 00:17:08.965 A:middle
from our -- from the WatchKit
side on the watch, right?

00:17:08.965 --> 00:17:12.316 A:middle
So you have the ability to
resize your images properly,

00:17:13.026 --> 00:17:15.175 A:middle
either on the phone or in
your servers, if they happen

00:17:15.175 --> 00:17:18.195 A:middle
to be dynamic images and
this makes an impact,

00:17:18.356 --> 00:17:20.896 A:middle
in terms of the rendering
of your UI.

00:17:22.316 --> 00:17:25.425 A:middle
Finally, you will have
some images that need

00:17:25.425 --> 00:17:27.146 A:middle
to be resized, for
example, buttons.

00:17:28.566 --> 00:17:30.886 A:middle
You can use -- you don't
need multiple sizes.

00:17:30.886 --> 00:17:32.396 A:middle
You can use image slicing.

00:17:32.396 --> 00:17:35.256 A:middle
This is a UI that you have
in your asset catalogs

00:17:35.256 --> 00:17:37.336 A:middle
and Interface Builder,
you can slice your images

00:17:37.336 --> 00:17:38.816 A:middle
and tell us how they
are resizing

00:17:39.326 --> 00:17:40.586 A:middle
and we do the right thing.

00:17:40.586 --> 00:17:43.346 A:middle
So you can give us one
particular image set

00:17:43.936 --> 00:17:45.676 A:middle
and we will -- it
will be applicable

00:17:45.676 --> 00:17:48.536 A:middle
for different sizes in your UI.

00:17:49.596 --> 00:17:53.006 A:middle
So this is the end of the static
part of the talk and now I would

00:17:53.006 --> 00:17:56.816 A:middle
like to invite Tom up to
add more dynamic aspects

00:17:56.816 --> 00:17:57.506 A:middle
to this model.

00:18:01.506 --> 00:18:01.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TOM WITKIN: Awesome.

00:18:03.626 --> 00:18:06.936 A:middle
Hello. I'm Tom, I
also work on WatchKit.

00:18:06.936 --> 00:18:09.856 A:middle
We will be discussing
animations and introducing those

00:18:10.136 --> 00:18:13.046 A:middle
into both your existing and
your new Watch OS 2 apps.

00:18:13.696 --> 00:18:15.546 A:middle
We will start off with
some existing types

00:18:15.546 --> 00:18:17.566 A:middle
of animation available
in Watch OS 1.

00:18:18.206 --> 00:18:20.396 A:middle
So tables are really flexible.

00:18:20.836 --> 00:18:23.686 A:middle
In certain updates on
tables will already animate.

00:18:24.226 --> 00:18:27.426 A:middle
If you insert rows,
if you remove rows

00:18:27.946 --> 00:18:29.996 A:middle
or if you update the
content within a row,

00:18:29.996 --> 00:18:34.106 A:middle
they will actually animate and
we will talk about all of these.

00:18:34.306 --> 00:18:35.886 A:middle
So all of our examples
are going to be

00:18:35.886 --> 00:18:37.496 A:middle
within the context
of our recipe app.

00:18:38.116 --> 00:18:39.856 A:middle
So let's start on
the recipe list.

00:18:40.266 --> 00:18:43.396 A:middle
And it would be great if
we could provide a way

00:18:43.396 --> 00:18:47.556 A:middle
to sort the list, either -- so
by ranking that we have assigned

00:18:47.966 --> 00:18:49.036 A:middle
or maybe alphabetical.

00:18:49.656 --> 00:18:54.416 A:middle
It's not extremely clear
how the list is being sorted

00:18:54.416 --> 00:18:55.326 A:middle
as we are doing this.

00:18:55.636 --> 00:18:58.546 A:middle
And so it would be great if
we could possibly insert a row

00:18:58.856 --> 00:19:01.326 A:middle
and say how the list is
sorted and then after a couple



00:18:58.856 --> 00:19:01.326 A:middle
and say how the list is
sorted and then after a couple

00:19:01.326 --> 00:19:02.966 A:middle
of seconds, take
it out of the UI.

00:19:02.966 --> 00:19:05.216 A:middle
So how are we doing this?

00:19:06.226 --> 00:19:07.166 A:middle
It's really simple.

00:19:07.376 --> 00:19:08.006 A:middle
We have a table.

00:19:08.006 --> 00:19:11.186 A:middle
And we are calling
insert rows and indexes

00:19:11.186 --> 00:19:13.516 A:middle
and we are inserting
a row of status type.

00:19:13.896 --> 00:19:18.236 A:middle
And then we are getting the row
controller and updating the text

00:19:18.236 --> 00:19:21.716 A:middle
on that row and then we
are scheduling a timer

00:19:22.176 --> 00:19:24.016 A:middle
for a few seconds
to remove the row

00:19:24.636 --> 00:19:25.996 A:middle
and that method is
then implemented here.

00:19:26.546 --> 00:19:31.796 A:middle
And so inserting and removing
rows can really add flexibility

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:33.036 A:middle
into your interfaces.

00:19:33.836 --> 00:19:35.706 A:middle
And one thing to point
out is you can insert

00:19:35.706 --> 00:19:37.116 A:middle
or remove rows of any type.

00:19:37.646 --> 00:19:40.316 A:middle
So for example, here we
have a list of recipes,

00:19:40.316 --> 00:19:43.456 A:middle
all the same type of cell,
however we are inserting a row

00:19:43.456 --> 00:19:45.476 A:middle
of an entirely different type.

00:19:45.966 --> 00:19:48.626 A:middle
So, again, it allows you to
have extremely dynamic content.

00:19:49.116 --> 00:19:50.186 A:middle
So within your interfaces.

00:19:50.796 --> 00:19:54.506 A:middle
I will also point out that if
you want to update your tables

00:19:54.706 --> 00:19:57.286 A:middle
and not animate we have 2 API
that I'm sure you all know

00:19:57.286 --> 00:19:59.956 A:middle
if you've used WatchKit
or Watch OS 1.



00:20:02.006 --> 00:20:05.746 A:middle
So moving on to the content
within a row and we will tap

00:20:05.746 --> 00:20:08.576 A:middle
into our detailed
view of our recipe.

00:20:08.836 --> 00:20:09.776 A:middle
And we have a description.

00:20:10.356 --> 00:20:12.766 A:middle
And because of the size of
Apple Watch, and the length

00:20:12.766 --> 00:20:14.806 A:middle
of a description, we
probably don't want

00:20:14.806 --> 00:20:16.716 A:middle
to have the full description
there all the time.

00:20:17.376 --> 00:20:19.956 A:middle
And so we have implemented our
description within a table row

00:20:19.956 --> 00:20:21.476 A:middle
and we show a truncated version.

00:20:22.066 --> 00:20:26.856 A:middle
It would be great if you tap on
the row, it will expand in place

00:20:26.856 --> 00:20:28.086 A:middle
and give the full description.

00:20:28.966 --> 00:20:34.016 A:middle
And so it's really nice --
it's a nice animation and it --

00:20:34.246 --> 00:20:36.716 A:middle
it provides you -- and so
the information you want,

00:20:36.716 --> 00:20:38.436 A:middle
exactly when you want it.

00:20:38.836 --> 00:20:40.046 A:middle
So how are we achieving this?

00:20:40.046 --> 00:20:41.556 A:middle
I will go back to
our blue boxes.

00:20:43.106 --> 00:20:44.126 A:middle
So we have our table cell.

00:20:44.156 --> 00:20:47.366 A:middle
And within the cell,
we have a few labels.

00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:50.096 A:middle
So we have our short label,
which has a description

00:20:50.096 --> 00:20:51.236 A:middle
with the truncated text.

00:20:51.486 --> 00:20:55.196 A:middle
We have another label,
which says tap to show more.

00:20:56.186 --> 00:20:58.016 A:middle
And then also we actually
have a third label.

00:20:58.466 --> 00:20:59.906 A:middle
So that's a full
descriptionlabel.



00:21:01.186 --> 00:21:06.416 A:middle
So the initial state of our cell
has the full description label

00:21:06.416 --> 00:21:10.566 A:middle
hidden and all we are doing
is the user taps on the cell,

00:21:10.776 --> 00:21:12.406 A:middle
is we are reversing this.

00:21:12.956 --> 00:21:15.606 A:middle
So we will unhide the
full description label

00:21:15.606 --> 00:21:19.556 A:middle
and we will hide the other
ones and just this will allow

00:21:19.556 --> 00:21:21.986 A:middle
that animation to happen,
that we handle in WatchKit.

00:21:22.296 --> 00:21:23.216 A:middle
So it's really simple.

00:21:23.716 --> 00:21:24.956 A:middle
And, again, here's the code.

00:21:24.956 --> 00:21:28.906 A:middle
So just in a few lines of code
-- within your application,

00:21:29.266 --> 00:21:31.116 A:middle
and it's a really
great experience.

00:21:35.276 --> 00:21:37.686 A:middle
And so, again, rows reload,

00:21:37.686 --> 00:21:39.856 A:middle
whenever their content
changes in height.

00:21:40.186 --> 00:21:42.066 A:middle
So if you are reloading a
row but it doesn't change

00:21:42.066 --> 00:21:44.126 A:middle
in height, there's no animation.

00:21:44.766 --> 00:21:49.086 A:middle
And so in order to achieve this,
make sure your rows have a size

00:21:49.126 --> 00:21:51.276 A:middle
to fit height, because if
they have a fixed height,

00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:52.686 A:middle
again the row isn't
actually changing.

00:21:57.636 --> 00:22:00.186 A:middle
So now we will go back
to our recipe list



00:21:57.636 --> 00:22:00.186 A:middle
So now we will go back
to our recipe list

00:22:00.186 --> 00:22:02.036 A:middle
and visit a different
type of animation.

00:22:02.496 --> 00:22:07.186 A:middle
And back to our cell and I will
call out these arrows here.

00:22:07.756 --> 00:22:10.066 A:middle
It would be great
if, as its displayed,

00:22:10.276 --> 00:22:11.716 A:middle
we could add a flourish
of some type

00:22:12.106 --> 00:22:14.966 A:middle
so the arrows spin
around, for example.

00:22:15.616 --> 00:22:19.206 A:middle
We can accomplish this
with an animated image.

00:22:19.866 --> 00:22:23.366 A:middle
So animated images are really
powerful, and they allow you

00:22:23.366 --> 00:22:27.306 A:middle
to cycle through a series of
images over a given duration.

00:22:27.856 --> 00:22:32.506 A:middle
And they also allow you to
repeat and reverse animations.

00:22:32.846 --> 00:22:34.506 A:middle
And it's the only
type of animation

00:22:34.626 --> 00:22:36.176 A:middle
within WatchKit that
will allow that.

00:22:36.246 --> 00:22:38.046 A:middle
So, again, there
are very powerful.

00:22:39.216 --> 00:22:42.046 A:middle
I do want to point out,
though, if you do have a series

00:22:42.046 --> 00:22:45.336 A:middle
of images -- so the number
of images can quickly add up

00:22:45.606 --> 00:22:48.956 A:middle
and so their costs in terms
of load times and performance,

00:22:48.956 --> 00:22:51.516 A:middle
as well as -- and
so memory usage.

00:22:51.976 --> 00:22:55.256 A:middle
Keep that in mind and reduce
the number of images as far

00:22:55.256 --> 00:22:58.176 A:middle
as you can, and the size of the
-- and the size of the images

00:22:58.176 --> 00:22:59.456 A:middle
and you will get
better performance.



00:23:02.496 --> 00:23:05.526 A:middle
I also want to point out
now our new picker object,

00:23:05.596 --> 00:23:10.376 A:middle
in Watch OS 2, and it allows
you to scrub through the images

00:23:10.586 --> 00:23:13.336 A:middle
within an animated image
so with a Digital Crown.

00:23:13.866 --> 00:23:16.446 A:middle
It's really powerful and
it's a great experience.

00:23:16.996 --> 00:23:21.156 A:middle
If you would like more
information, there is a session,

00:23:21.156 --> 00:23:25.006 A:middle
it's WatchKit In-Depth
Part 2, it's to learn

00:23:25.006 --> 00:23:26.186 A:middle
about the new picker object.

00:23:26.586 --> 00:23:31.976 A:middle
So that's existing
functionality in WatchKit.

00:23:31.976 --> 00:23:34.516 A:middle
I know a lot of people are
interested in the new stuff,

00:23:34.516 --> 00:23:37.236 A:middle
and so the animation API that we
are introducing in Watch OS 2.

00:23:38.216 --> 00:23:43.356 A:middle
So the animation API allows to
you animate certain properties

00:23:43.356 --> 00:23:49.246 A:middle
on your interface objects,
including the opacity, the width

00:23:49.246 --> 00:23:54.266 A:middle
and the height, the
alignment, so left to right

00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:55.646 A:middle
or top and bottom or center.

00:23:57.086 --> 00:24:01.746 A:middle
The background colors on
groups, so the color or the tint



00:23:57.086 --> 00:24:01.746 A:middle
The background colors on
groups, so the color or the tint

00:24:01.746 --> 00:24:06.546 A:middle
on an image like we have here on
the slide and the group insets.

00:24:07.836 --> 00:24:09.316 A:middle
So a lot of stuff
that you can animate.

00:24:09.316 --> 00:24:14.956 A:middle
If you have used -- if you
have programmed on iOS,

00:24:15.606 --> 00:24:17.546 A:middle
the API may look familiar.

00:24:17.966 --> 00:24:20.466 A:middle
It takes a duration
and an animation block

00:24:20.926 --> 00:24:22.626 A:middle
and all the updates you perform

00:24:22.626 --> 00:24:24.456 A:middle
within the animation
block will be animated

00:24:24.826 --> 00:24:25.866 A:middle
to the given duration.

00:24:26.486 --> 00:24:30.686 A:middle
So we will just jump right in
and talk about some examples

00:24:31.056 --> 00:24:32.616 A:middle
and hopefully show
some techniques,

00:24:32.666 --> 00:24:36.966 A:middle
as well as how you can integrate
this into your WatchKit apps.

00:24:38.306 --> 00:24:41.796 A:middle
And so our first example will
go back to our detailed view

00:24:41.796 --> 00:24:44.666 A:middle
in the app and tap into
the serving screen.

00:24:45.406 --> 00:24:48.346 A:middle
And we are going to add an
animation of where the circles

00:24:48.676 --> 00:24:50.646 A:middle
around the ring will
fade in sequentially.

00:24:51.146 --> 00:24:55.376 A:middle
So like this.

00:24:55.606 --> 00:24:59.366 A:middle
So in code, we are going
to loop through our groups

00:24:59.366 --> 00:25:00.296 A:middle
around that outer ring.



00:24:59.366 --> 00:25:00.296 A:middle
around that outer ring.

00:25:00.296 --> 00:25:01.726 A:middle
So every circle is a group.

00:25:02.796 --> 00:25:06.776 A:middle
We will create a dispatch block
and schedule our animation.

00:25:07.456 --> 00:25:10.236 A:middle
And then within the block,
we will animate the alpha

00:25:10.236 --> 00:25:13.376 A:middle
of the group, and
it will fade in.

00:25:13.746 --> 00:25:17.326 A:middle
So it's a very simple,
but you get a cool effect.

00:25:18.186 --> 00:25:20.826 A:middle
I also want to point out, we
are introducing two new API.

00:25:21.596 --> 00:25:24.396 A:middle
So did appear and will
disappear and they are

00:25:24.396 --> 00:25:25.966 A:middle
on WKInterfaceController.

00:25:26.416 --> 00:25:29.206 A:middle
These are important for your
animation and I will talk

00:25:29.206 --> 00:25:31.556 A:middle
about that in a moment,
I'll also point

00:25:31.556 --> 00:25:32.996 A:middle
out that this is
coming in a future seed.

00:25:33.626 --> 00:25:42.016 A:middle
So in this interface, use
did appear not will activate

00:25:42.086 --> 00:25:43.786 A:middle
if you are beginning
an animation

00:25:43.986 --> 00:25:45.466 A:middle
on the appearance of a view.

00:25:46.226 --> 00:25:48.856 A:middle
I know a lot of people are
using will activate right now

00:25:48.856 --> 00:25:52.556 A:middle
to start an animation, so will
activate is probably called

00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:55.846 A:middle
prior to it appearing on the
screen so it's not a good place

00:25:55.846 --> 00:25:56.776 A:middle
to start your animation.

00:25:57.056 --> 00:26:00.636 A:middle
So use the did appear method.



00:25:57.056 --> 00:26:00.636 A:middle
So use the did appear method.

00:26:00.636 --> 00:26:03.786 A:middle
Also you can stagger your
animations with timers or GCD.

00:26:03.786 --> 00:26:06.556 A:middle
If you do this, keep in mind,

00:26:06.766 --> 00:26:10.106 A:middle
that you can only update a
controller if it's active and so

00:26:10.106 --> 00:26:12.756 A:middle
if you are animating after the
controller has deactivated.

00:26:13.366 --> 00:26:16.196 A:middle
So those updates won't
actually be applied and so keep

00:26:16.196 --> 00:26:18.256 A:middle
that in mind and make sure
your controller is active.

00:26:19.596 --> 00:26:23.126 A:middle
Also keep track of the total
duration of your animation.

00:26:23.476 --> 00:26:25.296 A:middle
If you are chaining
a lot of animations,

00:26:25.296 --> 00:26:27.166 A:middle
the duration can quickly add up,

00:26:27.846 --> 00:26:30.476 A:middle
and most likely the user is
only interacting with your app

00:26:30.476 --> 00:26:33.896 A:middle
for a few seconds and if you
have a multisecond animation,

00:26:34.036 --> 00:26:38.006 A:middle
it's just prolonging your
times within your apps.

00:26:38.066 --> 00:26:41.026 A:middle
So be mindful of that.

00:26:41.156 --> 00:26:44.376 A:middle
And also just for convenience,
you can set your initial values

00:26:44.376 --> 00:26:45.346 A:middle
within the storyboard.

00:26:45.596 --> 00:26:48.906 A:middle
So for example, in this
interface, all of the --

00:26:48.956 --> 00:26:52.656 A:middle
so all the circles are initially
hidden and have an alpha zero

00:26:52.656 --> 00:26:55.016 A:middle
at the start and we can
have that in the storyboard

00:26:55.296 --> 00:26:56.806 A:middle
and not have to worry
about it at runtime.

00:26:57.376 --> 00:27:00.996 A:middle
So we will move on to
our second example,



00:26:57.376 --> 00:27:00.996 A:middle
So we will move on to
our second example,

00:27:01.216 --> 00:27:03.696 A:middle
which is our ingredients screen.

00:27:04.536 --> 00:27:06.946 A:middle
And it would be nice if we
could have the labels fly in.

00:27:07.626 --> 00:27:10.426 A:middle
So as you can see here.

00:27:10.426 --> 00:27:12.516 A:middle
So we'll break out
to our blue boxes.

00:27:13.176 --> 00:27:16.396 A:middle
And so we have our table row.

00:27:17.646 --> 00:27:20.526 A:middle
And as we showed earlier, we
have our number background

00:27:20.526 --> 00:27:21.996 A:middle
on the left which is the group

00:27:22.416 --> 00:27:23.636 A:middle
and we have our label
on the right.

00:27:24.376 --> 00:27:26.626 A:middle
And now we are going to add a
new group in between the two

00:27:26.626 --> 00:27:28.126 A:middle
and we will call
it a spacer group.

00:27:28.636 --> 00:27:31.286 A:middle
And groups are really
powerful in terms of laying

00:27:31.286 --> 00:27:32.436 A:middle
out the content within them

00:27:32.436 --> 00:27:34.706 A:middle
but they can also affect
the content around them.

00:27:34.746 --> 00:27:36.476 A:middle
So because the content --

00:27:36.836 --> 00:27:39.826 A:middle
and so because our layout
in WatchKit is flow based,

00:27:40.406 --> 00:27:43.076 A:middle
a group within the flow
can affect the other ones.

00:27:43.636 --> 00:27:46.516 A:middle
So, for example, here,
our initial state

00:27:46.516 --> 00:27:50.336 A:middle
of the cell has the spacer group
to be a full width and what

00:27:50.336 --> 00:27:52.946 A:middle
that does is it actually
pushes the label off the side

00:27:52.946 --> 00:27:55.826 A:middle
of the screen, and so you
can use this within --

00:27:56.066 --> 00:27:58.486 A:middle
so within your apps,
both for horizontal flow

00:27:58.786 --> 00:28:00.546 A:middle
and vertical flow
to kind of affect



00:27:58.786 --> 00:28:00.546 A:middle
and vertical flow
to kind of affect

00:28:00.546 --> 00:28:01.716 A:middle
where things are laying out.

00:28:02.256 --> 00:28:05.636 A:middle
And then as we animate, all we
are doing is updating the width

00:28:05.636 --> 00:28:08.476 A:middle
of our spacer group and that
label then will come in,

00:28:08.736 --> 00:28:11.816 A:middle
because we are recalculating
how our flow is laying

00:28:11.816 --> 00:28:12.996 A:middle
out the interface.

00:28:13.586 --> 00:28:19.106 A:middle
So in code, we are looping
through all of our table rows

00:28:20.326 --> 00:28:22.996 A:middle
and we are fading in both our
number background and label,

00:28:23.386 --> 00:28:25.246 A:middle
as well as setting the
width on that spacer group

00:28:25.616 --> 00:28:26.866 A:middle
and we are wrapping all of this

00:28:26.866 --> 00:28:28.246 A:middle
within in a single
animation block.

00:28:28.706 --> 00:28:31.976 A:middle
If you can, you can improve
your performance by wrapping all

00:28:31.976 --> 00:28:34.436 A:middle
of your animations within
a single block, however,

00:28:34.436 --> 00:28:35.926 A:middle
as I just -- as I showed,

00:28:35.926 --> 00:28:37.996 A:middle
if you are doing a sequential
animation that's fine,

00:28:37.996 --> 00:28:40.906 A:middle
but just keep in mind that
having a lot of animations

00:28:40.906 --> 00:28:42.626 A:middle
at once can affect
the performance.

00:28:43.136 --> 00:28:48.586 A:middle
So invisible spacer
groups are really powerful

00:28:48.816 --> 00:28:51.886 A:middle
and you can adjust the width,
height or alignment of them

00:28:51.886 --> 00:28:52.846 A:middle
and affect your layout.

00:28:53.476 --> 00:28:57.306 A:middle
And one thing to point out is as
you animate, we actually relay

00:28:57.306 --> 00:29:00.846 A:middle
out your entire interface and
this is how I can set the width



00:28:57.306 --> 00:29:00.846 A:middle
out your entire interface and
this is how I can set the width

00:29:00.846 --> 00:29:05.106 A:middle
on that group and the label is
actually changing its position,

00:29:05.106 --> 00:29:08.236 A:middle
even though I'm not -- and so
I'm not changing it myself.

00:29:11.976 --> 00:29:13.846 A:middle
And so now on to
our third example,

00:29:13.846 --> 00:29:16.016 A:middle
which is the most
complex of the examples.

00:29:16.496 --> 00:29:20.466 A:middle
So we have this screen where
you can add a note, and we'll --

00:29:20.526 --> 00:29:23.186 A:middle
and if you tap on add note,
we will have our default

00:29:23.186 --> 00:29:24.546 A:middle
on text input on the system.

00:29:24.946 --> 00:29:28.846 A:middle
If you choose an
option, we'll insert --

00:29:29.386 --> 00:29:31.406 A:middle
or we'll animate
in a speech bubble.

00:29:31.576 --> 00:29:34.126 A:middle
And so already we have
a more complex animation

00:29:34.586 --> 00:29:36.956 A:middle
but we're going to go
one step further on this.

00:29:37.646 --> 00:29:42.086 A:middle
And if you tap confirm,
we will animate

00:29:42.086 --> 00:29:43.296 A:middle
in a confirmation screen.

00:29:43.616 --> 00:29:45.776 A:middle
So all of this is
within one interface

00:29:46.006 --> 00:29:47.826 A:middle
and it's all using
the new animation API.

00:29:48.856 --> 00:29:51.106 A:middle
And so we will break
this up into two parts.

00:29:51.106 --> 00:29:53.336 A:middle
Let's talk about the
speech bubble first.

00:29:56.416 --> 00:29:57.636 A:middle
So back to a wire frame.

00:29:58.816 --> 00:30:00.676 A:middle
Within our interface,
we have a group



00:29:58.816 --> 00:30:00.676 A:middle
Within our interface,
we have a group

00:30:01.136 --> 00:30:04.166 A:middle
and that's the text
container I will call it.

00:30:04.436 --> 00:30:06.896 A:middle
Within that, we have our
text bubble which is on top,

00:30:06.896 --> 00:30:07.956 A:middle
which has our label in it.

00:30:08.426 --> 00:30:13.636 A:middle
And then below that, we have
our confirmation button.

00:30:13.636 --> 00:30:18.826 A:middle
As we animate, our initial
state has our text, so bottom

00:30:18.956 --> 00:30:22.226 A:middle
and right aligned,
as you can see here,

00:30:22.226 --> 00:30:23.386 A:middle
the button is faded out.

00:30:24.426 --> 00:30:27.726 A:middle
As we animate, we will update
the width of our text bubble

00:30:27.726 --> 00:30:29.916 A:middle
and the height and
fade both that

00:30:30.356 --> 00:30:33.216 A:middle
and the button in,
as you can see here.

00:30:33.806 --> 00:30:37.616 A:middle
And so we get that effect --

00:30:37.616 --> 00:30:41.446 A:middle
and so we get that effect
with just a few lines of code.

00:30:41.446 --> 00:30:43.406 A:middle
On the text bubble, we
were updating the width,

00:30:43.576 --> 00:30:46.706 A:middle
the height and alpha as I said.

00:30:46.706 --> 00:30:48.906 A:middle
And the size to fit
height is because we want

00:30:48.906 --> 00:30:50.406 A:middle
to fit the full text
of that label.

00:30:50.956 --> 00:30:54.486 A:middle
Regardless of how long
that note is, it will fit.

00:30:55.896 --> 00:30:59.066 A:middle
We will fade in the button
by updating the alpha



00:31:00.466 --> 00:31:02.536 A:middle
and we'll update the
height of the text container

00:31:02.536 --> 00:31:03.566 A:middle
as well to fit everything.

00:31:04.856 --> 00:31:07.226 A:middle
And wrapping all of that
within an animation block.

00:31:07.746 --> 00:31:11.346 A:middle
So that's part one
of that animation.

00:31:12.466 --> 00:31:15.556 A:middle
Part two is where we show
the confirmation screen.

00:31:16.086 --> 00:31:21.066 A:middle
And so back to our blue boxes.

00:31:21.706 --> 00:31:25.876 A:middle
Here we have our text container
and I won't include the objects

00:31:25.876 --> 00:31:27.236 A:middle
within that here
just for clarity.

00:31:28.006 --> 00:31:31.756 A:middle
But also within the interface
below, we have another group,

00:31:31.756 --> 00:31:34.086 A:middle
which I will call the
confirmation container.

00:31:34.086 --> 00:31:37.046 A:middle
And so what we are doing here
is we are wrapping the different

00:31:37.046 --> 00:31:39.746 A:middle
parts of our interfaces
in their own groups,

00:31:40.006 --> 00:31:42.886 A:middle
and what that allows
us is we can --

00:31:42.886 --> 00:31:45.716 A:middle
we can collapse or expand them

00:31:46.006 --> 00:31:47.846 A:middle
to show different
parts of the interface.

00:31:48.336 --> 00:31:51.666 A:middle
For example, here is the
initial state of that interface.

00:31:52.126 --> 00:31:53.996 A:middle
So the text container
is full height

00:31:54.516 --> 00:31:57.826 A:middle
and the confirmation container
actually has a height of zero

00:31:58.116 --> 00:32:00.596 A:middle
and so it's hidden on screen.



00:31:58.116 --> 00:32:00.596 A:middle
and so it's hidden on screen.

00:32:01.076 --> 00:32:04.176 A:middle
And because of how our new
behavior in the set width

00:32:04.176 --> 00:32:07.496 A:middle
and set height API, you can
actually achieve a higher width

00:32:07.496 --> 00:32:07.966 A:middle
-than zero.

00:32:09.076 --> 00:32:12.706 A:middle
As we animate, all we're
doing is reversing the heights

00:32:12.706 --> 00:32:13.116 A:middle
of these.

00:32:13.726 --> 00:32:16.706 A:middle
So the text container
now has a height of zero

00:32:17.226 --> 00:32:20.986 A:middle
and the confirmation
container now is a full height

00:32:21.286 --> 00:32:22.826 A:middle
of the screen.

00:32:23.876 --> 00:32:27.426 A:middle
In code, it's exactly what I
said, we are updating the height

00:32:27.496 --> 00:32:28.376 A:middle
of the text container,

00:32:29.646 --> 00:32:32.626 A:middle
the height of the confirmation
container and just wrapping

00:32:32.626 --> 00:32:34.006 A:middle
that within an animation block.

00:32:34.986 --> 00:32:37.836 A:middle
And so that's how you get
the effect of one part

00:32:37.836 --> 00:32:39.596 A:middle
of the interface sort
of zooming off screen

00:32:39.896 --> 00:32:41.616 A:middle
and the other zooming on.

00:32:43.376 --> 00:32:48.406 A:middle
And so I want to bring out a few
notes on animation, just to kind

00:32:48.406 --> 00:32:50.556 A:middle
of wrap up and summarize
but also just to point

00:32:50.556 --> 00:32:52.566 A:middle
out a few gotchas that
you might run into.

00:32:54.316 --> 00:32:56.686 A:middle
So any update that
affects the sizing

00:32:56.726 --> 00:32:59.096 A:middle
of your interface
objects can actually --

00:32:59.516 --> 00:33:00.816 A:middle
can actually animate the layout.



00:32:59.516 --> 00:33:00.816 A:middle
can actually animate the layout.

00:33:01.336 --> 00:33:04.206 A:middle
So, for example, if you
update the text of a label,

00:33:04.946 --> 00:33:08.636 A:middle
that is sized to fit, that label
is changing in width or height

00:33:09.166 --> 00:33:11.956 A:middle
and so if you do that
within an animation block,

00:33:11.956 --> 00:33:14.696 A:middle
it will actually animate to
the new frame of that label.

00:33:15.346 --> 00:33:18.516 A:middle
However, you won't actually
be animating the application

00:33:18.516 --> 00:33:20.706 A:middle
of the text, but just
the sizing of that label.

00:33:22.846 --> 00:33:25.576 A:middle
If you have lots of
animations at once

00:33:25.886 --> 00:33:30.386 A:middle
or if you have a complex type
of layout within your interface,

00:33:30.646 --> 00:33:33.006 A:middle
that can affect the performance,
and so definitely keep

00:33:33.006 --> 00:33:36.696 A:middle
that in mind, and absolutely
make sure to test on hardware.

00:33:37.076 --> 00:33:40.286 A:middle
So the simulator is a great
way to build up your animations

00:33:40.546 --> 00:33:42.056 A:middle
and to make sure
everything is working,

00:33:42.336 --> 00:33:43.686 A:middle
but for actual performance

00:33:43.686 --> 00:33:45.406 A:middle
and to see how things
will actually work,

00:33:45.676 --> 00:33:46.876 A:middle
make sure to test on hardware.

00:33:46.876 --> 00:33:48.196 A:middle
That's extremely important.

00:33:49.696 --> 00:33:51.626 A:middle
And also a thing to point out is

00:33:51.626 --> 00:33:52.936 A:middle
that this animation
is functional

00:33:52.936 --> 00:33:54.026 A:middle
within your applications.

00:33:54.496 --> 00:33:57.836 A:middle
However, if you call it within
a glance or notification.

00:33:58.306 --> 00:34:00.126 A:middle
So those updates
will still be applied



00:33:58.306 --> 00:34:00.126 A:middle
So those updates
will still be applied

00:34:00.126 --> 00:34:01.166 A:middle
but they won't be animated.

00:34:01.906 --> 00:34:04.156 A:middle
And so there's no
point in using this

00:34:04.156 --> 00:34:05.516 A:middle
within a glance or
a notification.

00:34:06.106 --> 00:34:08.835 A:middle
A few more notes.

00:34:10.045 --> 00:34:11.196 A:middle
So use with restraint.

00:34:11.436 --> 00:34:12.876 A:middle
And that's because animation,

00:34:13.005 --> 00:34:15.146 A:middle
it should never be the
focus of your interface.

00:34:15.706 --> 00:34:20.036 A:middle
If the animation is the reason
that your interface exists,

00:34:20.036 --> 00:34:22.596 A:middle
it probably is time
to rethink that.

00:34:22.916 --> 00:34:25.696 A:middle
And also, again, keep
the total duration short.

00:34:25.696 --> 00:34:29.786 A:middle
We -- so the amount of time
within your app is probably

00:34:29.786 --> 00:34:32.775 A:middle
on the order of seconds and so
don't prolong the animation,

00:34:32.775 --> 00:34:33.726 A:middle
like, any more than you have to.

00:34:34.116 --> 00:34:35.596 A:middle
And there's a great
session on this,

00:34:35.596 --> 00:34:39.275 A:middle
"Designing with Animation",
I highly recommend that.

00:34:39.275 --> 00:34:42.496 A:middle
And so to wrap up and conclude
the talk, and so layout

00:34:42.496 --> 00:34:45.266 A:middle
in WatchKit is different
than UIKit and AppKitt

00:34:45.266 --> 00:34:46.866 A:middle
where it's specified
in design time

00:34:47.416 --> 00:34:49.876 A:middle
but very flexible at runtime.

00:34:49.926 --> 00:34:54.056 A:middle
We have a lot of API and we're
introducing a lot of new API

00:34:54.156 --> 00:34:57.946 A:middle
that allows you to update, to
update your UI at one time.

00:34:59.136 --> 00:35:00.376 A:middle
Again, it's flow based



00:34:59.136 --> 00:35:00.376 A:middle
Again, it's flow based

00:35:00.666 --> 00:35:04.296 A:middle
and so you are specifying
the layout heuristics

00:35:04.546 --> 00:35:07.856 A:middle
of your objects but WatchKit
itself is doing all the layout.

00:35:08.636 --> 00:35:10.246 A:middle
And groups are really powerful.

00:35:10.646 --> 00:35:13.996 A:middle
And as you have seen, you can
build very complex interfaces

00:35:14.466 --> 00:35:19.416 A:middle
that you may not have thought
were possible within WatchKit.

00:35:19.416 --> 00:35:21.996 A:middle
And now to add animation
within your apps.

00:35:22.766 --> 00:35:26.116 A:middle
So animation is a great way
to add liveliness or feedback

00:35:26.116 --> 00:35:27.646 A:middle
within your apps, I'm
sure you all know that.

00:35:28.346 --> 00:35:30.646 A:middle
We have lots of ways
already within WatchKit

00:35:30.646 --> 00:35:35.136 A:middle
that you can introduce these
animations and we are making

00:35:35.136 --> 00:35:38.506 A:middle
that even more powerful
in Watch OS 2.

00:35:38.756 --> 00:35:41.526 A:middle
So for more information,
there's a lot of documentation

00:35:41.526 --> 00:35:44.426 A:middle
and technical support, we will
also be releasing our sample

00:35:44.426 --> 00:35:47.236 A:middle
code as a project on
developer.Apple.com.

00:35:47.966 --> 00:35:51.456 A:middle
And for general questions
we have our evangelist,

00:35:51.456 --> 00:35:52.956 A:middle
Jake Barrens.

00:35:52.956 --> 00:35:56.296 A:middle
So ask him all the
questions you may have.

00:35:56.596 --> 00:35:59.496 A:middle
There's tons of related
content this week

00:35:59.956 --> 00:36:01.276 A:middle
and some are still happening.



00:35:59.956 --> 00:36:01.276 A:middle
and some are still happening.

00:36:01.886 --> 00:36:05.216 A:middle
I want to point out the Tips
and Tricks one tomorrow morning,

00:36:05.546 --> 00:36:08.746 A:middle
and the Design Tips and
Tricks one tomorrow afternoon.

00:36:09.126 --> 00:36:09.976 A:middle
So both are very good.

00:36:11.296 --> 00:36:11.946 A:middle
So thank you.

00:36:11.946 --> 00:36:14.646 A:middle
Enjoy your time here.

00:36:14.936 --> 00:36:15.286 A:middle
Thanks.

00:36:16.516 --> 00:36:28.870 A:middle
