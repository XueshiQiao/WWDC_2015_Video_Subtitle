00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:26.626 A:middle
&gt;&gt; MIKE STERN: Hello, everyone.

00:00:28.986 --> 00:00:30.036 A:middle
My name is Mike Stern.

00:00:30.156 --> 00:00:32.606 A:middle
I'm the user experience
evangelist at Apple.

00:00:33.226 --> 00:00:35.566 A:middle
I'm really happy to be
with you today to talk

00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.506 A:middle
about designing for Apple Watch.

00:00:39.016 --> 00:00:42.366 A:middle
The Apple Watch is unlike
any device we have ever made.

00:00:43.056 --> 00:00:46.886 A:middle
It features all new ways to
select input and navigate

00:00:47.416 --> 00:00:51.256 A:middle
that are ideally suited to a
smaller device that's designed

00:00:51.256 --> 00:00:52.706 A:middle
to be worn on the wrist.

00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:57.586 A:middle
The Digital Crown affords
the ability to scroll, zoom,

00:00:57.796 --> 00:01:01.316 A:middle
and change values without
obscuring your view.



00:00:57.796 --> 00:01:01.316 A:middle
and change values without
obscuring your view.

00:01:02.576 --> 00:01:05.646 A:middle
The Force Touch display
adds a new dimension

00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:07.026 A:middle
to the user interface.

00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:10.996 A:middle
Apple Watch's interface
is attuned

00:01:11.186 --> 00:01:12.596 A:middle
to the wearer's presence.

00:01:13.356 --> 00:01:15.146 A:middle
It wakes when you
raise your wrist

00:01:15.696 --> 00:01:18.086 A:middle
and it sleeps when you lower it.

00:01:18.916 --> 00:01:23.816 A:middle
Apple Watch blurs the boundaries
between software and hardware.

00:01:24.886 --> 00:01:28.936 A:middle
And the Taptic Engine creates
discrete, sophisticated

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:34.056 A:middle
and nuanced experiences by
engaging more of your senses.

00:01:35.276 --> 00:01:38.566 A:middle
Apple Watch is ideally
suited for quick looks

00:01:38.926 --> 00:01:40.146 A:middle
and fast interactions.

00:01:41.036 --> 00:01:42.306 A:middle
The apps that you design

00:01:42.306 --> 00:01:45.606 A:middle
for Apple Watch should take
advantage of these things.

00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:51.016 A:middle
Your apps should complement
their companion iPhone app

00:01:51.826 --> 00:01:55.106 A:middle
by making information
and actions quicker

00:01:55.186 --> 00:01:57.236 A:middle
and more convenient to access.

00:01:58.436 --> 00:02:02.606 A:middle
Or they should extend the
functionality of your iPhone app



00:01:58.436 --> 00:02:02.606 A:middle
Or they should extend the
functionality of your iPhone app

00:02:02.606 --> 00:02:05.096 A:middle
in ways that were
previously not possible.

00:02:06.646 --> 00:02:11.516 A:middle
Making really great Apple Watch
apps requires a different mind

00:02:11.586 --> 00:02:15.636 A:middle
set and approach than
designing for iOS or for Mac.

00:02:17.186 --> 00:02:20.046 A:middle
Which is why today I
would like to share

00:02:20.046 --> 00:02:24.026 A:middle
with you the three key
foundational design themes

00:02:24.026 --> 00:02:28.826 A:middle
of the Apple Watch, and the
apps that we made to run on it.

00:02:29.376 --> 00:02:32.656 A:middle
The first theme is about
personal communication.

00:02:33.696 --> 00:02:36.046 A:middle
Apple Watch is designed
to be worn.

00:02:36.866 --> 00:02:40.466 A:middle
No other other Apple
device has ever been

00:02:40.466 --> 00:02:43.076 A:middle
so closely connected
to the user.

00:02:44.566 --> 00:02:47.386 A:middle
Interactions on Apple Watch
create a more intimate

00:02:47.826 --> 00:02:50.456 A:middle
and personal experience
with technology.

00:02:51.516 --> 00:02:55.206 A:middle
The communication that occurs
between your app and the people

00:02:55.206 --> 00:02:58.466 A:middle
who use it should be just
as intimate and personal.

00:02:59.856 --> 00:03:02.126 A:middle
Now consider how we
communicate with each other.



00:02:59.856 --> 00:03:02.126 A:middle
Now consider how we
communicate with each other.

00:03:02.126 --> 00:03:05.026 A:middle
When we are speaking with
someone, we try to get a sense

00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:07.306 A:middle
of what the other
person wants to know

00:03:07.406 --> 00:03:09.006 A:middle
and what they are
trying to tell us.

00:03:09.616 --> 00:03:13.336 A:middle
We try to use terms that
they'll understand and concepts

00:03:13.336 --> 00:03:14.216 A:middle
that they are familiar with.

00:03:15.586 --> 00:03:17.946 A:middle
When they look busy or
stressed out, we try to get

00:03:17.946 --> 00:03:19.196 A:middle
to the point more quickly.

00:03:20.026 --> 00:03:22.036 A:middle
Personal communication
requires us

00:03:22.476 --> 00:03:24.726 A:middle
to be attentive and empathetic.

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:28.976 A:middle
Now, take that and apply it
to the design of your apps.

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:32.466 A:middle
Probably one of the
most important aspects

00:03:32.536 --> 00:03:36.136 A:middle
of personal communication
is just being considerate

00:03:36.136 --> 00:03:37.606 A:middle
of people's time and attention.

00:03:38.456 --> 00:03:40.006 A:middle
We are all busy people.

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:42.816 A:middle
We live in a world filled
with constant distraction.

00:03:43.346 --> 00:03:44.426 A:middle
We often don't want

00:03:44.426 --> 00:03:47.826 A:middle
to be disturbed unless it
is something super urgent

00:03:48.156 --> 00:03:50.106 A:middle
or something we care
about deeply.

00:03:50.956 --> 00:03:52.886 A:middle
This is especially
true when it comes

00:03:52.936 --> 00:03:55.036 A:middle
to notifications on Apple Watch.

00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:58.096 A:middle
Apple Watch taps
a person's wrist

00:03:58.096 --> 00:03:59.716 A:middle
when they receive
a notification.



00:04:00.436 --> 00:04:03.476 A:middle
This makes notifications
much more noticeable.

00:04:04.096 --> 00:04:06.656 A:middle
So carefully consider
how frequently you send

00:04:06.656 --> 00:04:07.926 A:middle
notifications to people.

00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:11.726 A:middle
They will get annoyed if you
send notifications too often.

00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:15.776 A:middle
Keep in mind that there's
no way for people to choose

00:04:16.185 --> 00:04:19.916 A:middle
which of your apps notifications
they'll receive on their watch.

00:04:20.546 --> 00:04:22.646 A:middle
They can only choose
whether or not they want

00:04:22.646 --> 00:04:25.886 A:middle
to receive notifications
from your app on their watch.

00:04:27.056 --> 00:04:30.716 A:middle
Avoid pestering them by frequent
interruptions throughout

00:04:30.806 --> 00:04:31.246 A:middle
the day.

00:04:32.066 --> 00:04:33.906 A:middle
Otherwise they will
pretty quickly wind

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:36.986 A:middle
up turning off notifications
from your app on their watch

00:04:37.526 --> 00:04:39.436 A:middle
and maybe on their
iPhone as well.

00:04:40.706 --> 00:04:42.656 A:middle
Next, keep it relevant.

00:04:43.276 --> 00:04:45.876 A:middle
When we talk with someone,
we try to say things

00:04:45.876 --> 00:04:46.836 A:middle
that the other person is going

00:04:46.836 --> 00:04:48.746 A:middle
to find interesting
or informative.

00:04:49.596 --> 00:04:52.046 A:middle
Similarly the notifications
that you send

00:04:52.046 --> 00:04:55.776 A:middle
to people should contain
valuable and useful information.

00:04:56.576 --> 00:05:00.156 A:middle
People should actually feel
thankful for the notifications



00:04:56.576 --> 00:05:00.156 A:middle
People should actually feel
thankful for the notifications

00:05:00.346 --> 00:05:01.366 A:middle
that you send to them.

00:05:02.196 --> 00:05:04.766 A:middle
Now, determining relevance
can sometimes be pretty

00:05:04.766 --> 00:05:05.556 A:middle
straight forward.

00:05:06.316 --> 00:05:09.236 A:middle
CNN sends notifications
about breaking news stories.

00:05:09.936 --> 00:05:12.366 A:middle
It's a reasonable assumption
on their part that people

00:05:12.366 --> 00:05:14.966 A:middle
who have downloaded their
app and installed it

00:05:14.966 --> 00:05:16.566 A:middle
on their watch want to know

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:18.966 A:middle
about major news
stories as they unfold.

00:05:19.836 --> 00:05:23.426 A:middle
But for many apps or situations
this approach wouldn't work

00:05:23.426 --> 00:05:23.946 A:middle
so well.

00:05:24.696 --> 00:05:28.476 A:middle
Being relevant often requires
understanding context.

00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:31.706 A:middle
People's interests may
vary based on all sorts

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:33.136 A:middle
of contextual factors.

00:05:33.786 --> 00:05:35.486 A:middle
By understanding that context,

00:05:35.486 --> 00:05:39.286 A:middle
you can prioritize certain
information or functions.

00:05:40.296 --> 00:05:43.496 A:middle
Now, the two main contextual
factors that are used

00:05:43.496 --> 00:05:46.896 A:middle
to determine relevancy
are location and time.

00:05:48.146 --> 00:05:50.956 A:middle
Let's take a look at how
location can be used.

00:05:52.296 --> 00:05:54.866 A:middle
Invoice2Go is an app
that enables people

00:05:54.866 --> 00:05:57.176 A:middle
to track the hours
that they work

00:05:57.176 --> 00:05:59.246 A:middle
and send invoices
to their clients.

00:05:59.846 --> 00:06:02.176 A:middle
For many of the people
who use their app,



00:05:59.846 --> 00:06:02.176 A:middle
For many of the people
who use their app,

00:06:02.176 --> 00:06:03.956 A:middle
time tracking is
based on location.

00:06:05.336 --> 00:06:08.066 A:middle
Billing starts when they
arrive at the job site,

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:10.096 A:middle
and it ends when they leave.

00:06:11.036 --> 00:06:14.766 A:middle
Invoice2Go will optionally send
you a notification as a reminder

00:06:15.026 --> 00:06:18.156 A:middle
to start and stop time
tracking based on location.

00:06:18.716 --> 00:06:20.136 A:middle
By using your location,

00:06:20.186 --> 00:06:23.616 A:middle
Invoice2Go makes tracking
billable hours more convenient

00:06:23.996 --> 00:06:25.736 A:middle
and more accurate than trying

00:06:25.736 --> 00:06:29.336 A:middle
to remember how long you worked
hours or even days later.

00:06:30.576 --> 00:06:33.696 A:middle
Now as with location it is
important to find the right time

00:06:33.996 --> 00:06:35.266 A:middle
to communicate with someone.

00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:37.866 A:middle
Some information
is only relevant

00:06:37.866 --> 00:06:39.556 A:middle
at very specific moments.

00:06:40.276 --> 00:06:41.766 A:middle
So, for example, when
you are traveling

00:06:41.766 --> 00:06:44.826 A:middle
with American Airlines, their
app will send a reminder

00:06:44.826 --> 00:06:47.136 A:middle
when it's time for you
to leave for the airport.

00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:49.766 A:middle
This is very relevant
information.

00:06:49.766 --> 00:06:51.336 A:middle
No one wants to miss
their flight.

00:06:52.806 --> 00:06:54.266 A:middle
Now, another big aspect

00:06:54.266 --> 00:06:57.526 A:middle
of personal communication
is just paying attention.

00:06:58.466 --> 00:06:59.746 A:middle
People say this all
the time, right?

00:06:59.746 --> 00:07:02.176 A:middle
It is important for
you to pay attention.



00:06:59.746 --> 00:07:02.176 A:middle
It is important for
you to pay attention.

00:07:02.676 --> 00:07:03.696 A:middle
Well, it is true.

00:07:04.146 --> 00:07:05.166 A:middle
Without paying attention,

00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:07.916 A:middle
you can never really know
what it is that people want.

00:07:08.766 --> 00:07:10.566 A:middle
So, for example, if
you're not sure what kind

00:07:10.566 --> 00:07:13.026 A:middle
of notifications people are
going to find most relevant,

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:14.796 A:middle
just ask them to tell you.

00:07:15.566 --> 00:07:18.266 A:middle
Nike running and lots of
other apps have settings

00:07:18.266 --> 00:07:19.626 A:middle
to allow people determine

00:07:19.626 --> 00:07:22.266 A:middle
which notifications
they want to receive.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:26.916 A:middle
These kinds of settings are
what we might call explicit

00:07:26.916 --> 00:07:28.126 A:middle
user preferences.

00:07:29.026 --> 00:07:32.286 A:middle
They are very direct ways to
determine what is most important

00:07:32.326 --> 00:07:34.026 A:middle
to the people who use your app.

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:37.496 A:middle
However, people don't
often explore app settings.

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:39.486 A:middle
They can be difficult to find.

00:07:39.846 --> 00:07:42.986 A:middle
It takes an investment of
time to muck around with them.

00:07:43.016 --> 00:07:44.526 A:middle
People don't always
know what they do.

00:07:45.686 --> 00:07:48.186 A:middle
That's where implicit user
preferences will come in.

00:07:48.976 --> 00:07:50.256 A:middle
When you get to know someone,

00:07:50.256 --> 00:07:52.636 A:middle
you learn about their
tastes and their interests.

00:07:53.186 --> 00:07:55.746 A:middle
A lot of this you pick up just
by observing what it is they

00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:57.666 A:middle
like to talk about and do.

00:07:58.606 --> 00:08:01.296 A:middle
For instance, if you regularly
get coffee with a friend,



00:07:58.606 --> 00:08:01.296 A:middle
For instance, if you regularly
get coffee with a friend,

00:08:01.816 --> 00:08:04.516 A:middle
you probably know what kind
of coffee they like to drink

00:08:04.876 --> 00:08:06.216 A:middle
and how they like it prepared.

00:08:06.726 --> 00:08:09.696 A:middle
Because of that knowledge, you
can go and order them a drink,

00:08:10.306 --> 00:08:12.726 A:middle
and you would get just the
right thing that they wanted

00:08:12.836 --> 00:08:14.676 A:middle
without them having
to even tell you.

00:08:15.536 --> 00:08:18.386 A:middle
By observing and responding
to people's interactions

00:08:18.386 --> 00:08:21.106 A:middle
or behaviors, your
app can make subtle

00:08:21.246 --> 00:08:22.916 A:middle
but significant adjustments

00:08:22.916 --> 00:08:25.526 A:middle
to better accommodate
the preferences

00:08:25.526 --> 00:08:26.726 A:middle
of the people who use it.

00:08:27.686 --> 00:08:30.796 A:middle
The Fitness app is a great
demonstration of this concept.

00:08:31.686 --> 00:08:33.905 A:middle
Let's say I'm going
to go for a run.

00:08:34.155 --> 00:08:36.176 A:middle
I'm going to go work out
for the very first time.

00:08:36.176 --> 00:08:39.206 A:middle
I'm presented with a list of
different workout options.

00:08:40.025 --> 00:08:42.145 A:middle
I'm going to pick outdoor run.

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:46.866 A:middle
On the next screen,
I'm given the choice

00:08:46.936 --> 00:08:48.606 A:middle
to select a goal for my run.

00:08:49.366 --> 00:08:51.606 A:middle
I can choose to have
a calorie goal

00:08:51.886 --> 00:08:53.976 A:middle
or duration goal
or a distance goal.

00:08:54.706 --> 00:08:56.556 A:middle
Now, when I work out, I don't

00:08:56.556 --> 00:08:59.086 A:middle
like to set very high
expectations for myself.

00:08:59.566 --> 00:09:01.406 A:middle
So I'm going to go with no goal.



00:08:59.566 --> 00:09:01.406 A:middle
So I'm going to go with no goal.

00:09:02.756 --> 00:09:05.936 A:middle
Finally, I just tap
start and off I go.

00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:09.066 A:middle
Now, let's fast forward
a couple of days.

00:09:09.956 --> 00:09:12.286 A:middle
I'm going to go for
an outdoor run again

00:09:12.286 --> 00:09:14.146 A:middle
because I always run outside.

00:09:14.696 --> 00:09:16.086 A:middle
When I launch the Fitness app,

00:09:16.166 --> 00:09:18.716 A:middle
outdoor run is the first
option in the list.

00:09:18.716 --> 00:09:22.206 A:middle
That list is being reordered
based on frequency of use.

00:09:23.256 --> 00:09:26.476 A:middle
And because it contains
information about my last run,

00:09:26.806 --> 00:09:29.556 A:middle
it is now physically taller,
so it's more prominent

00:09:29.556 --> 00:09:32.546 A:middle
and easier for me to tap.

00:09:32.546 --> 00:09:37.436 A:middle
On the next screen, the no goal
option is selected by default,

00:09:38.176 --> 00:09:40.146 A:middle
because that's the last
option that I chose.

00:09:40.856 --> 00:09:43.946 A:middle
It's unlikely for me
to change this setting.

00:09:44.716 --> 00:09:46.446 A:middle
By displaying it by
default, I don't have

00:09:46.486 --> 00:09:49.006 A:middle
to swipe past three screens
every single time I want

00:09:49.006 --> 00:09:51.216 A:middle
to go for a run.

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:54.836 A:middle
By remembering basic
information about how I,

00:09:54.836 --> 00:09:57.926 A:middle
as an individual user,
like to work out,

00:09:58.146 --> 00:10:01.506 A:middle
Fitness is tailoring itself to
suit my individual preferences.



00:09:58.146 --> 00:10:01.506 A:middle
Fitness is tailoring itself to
suit my individual preferences.

00:10:02.526 --> 00:10:05.166 A:middle
There's no configuration
that happens per se.

00:10:05.556 --> 00:10:06.976 A:middle
It just happens automatically.

00:10:06.976 --> 00:10:10.476 A:middle
It is a bit like having a
really good personal trainer.

00:10:10.966 --> 00:10:13.106 A:middle
A personal trainer
listens to you.

00:10:13.206 --> 00:10:15.346 A:middle
They understand what
your Fitness goals are

00:10:15.816 --> 00:10:16.806 A:middle
and remember the types

00:10:16.806 --> 00:10:19.326 A:middle
of exercises you do
when you work out.

00:10:20.836 --> 00:10:24.366 A:middle
Finally, when we are speaking
with someone who is really busy

00:10:24.626 --> 00:10:28.196 A:middle
or seems stressed out or kind
of distracted, we try to get

00:10:28.196 --> 00:10:31.716 A:middle
to the point more quickly
and drop irrelevant datails.

00:10:32.586 --> 00:10:35.646 A:middle
Interactions on Apple
Watch are very brief.

00:10:36.196 --> 00:10:38.476 A:middle
Your notifications, Glances

00:10:38.566 --> 00:10:43.136 A:middle
and apps should communicate the
most critical information only.

00:10:44.226 --> 00:10:49.616 A:middle
Okay. So let's move on to the
next big theme for the design

00:10:49.676 --> 00:10:52.286 A:middle
of Apple Watch and that
is Holistic Design.

00:10:53.456 --> 00:10:56.386 A:middle
Holistic Design is about
blurring the boundaries

00:10:56.386 --> 00:10:58.276 A:middle
between software and hardware.

00:10:59.536 --> 00:11:03.496 A:middle
The black color of the Watch
bezel was carefully chosen



00:10:59.536 --> 00:11:03.496 A:middle
The black color of the Watch
bezel was carefully chosen

00:11:03.806 --> 00:11:05.716 A:middle
to match the color
of the display.

00:11:06.606 --> 00:11:09.966 A:middle
This makes the border or
boundary between the display

00:11:09.966 --> 00:11:12.746 A:middle
and bezel practically
indistinguishable.

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:16.226 A:middle
If you design your app to
have a black background,

00:11:16.536 --> 00:11:19.026 A:middle
the bezel will provide
visual padding

00:11:19.026 --> 00:11:20.526 A:middle
for your app's interface.

00:11:21.426 --> 00:11:25.736 A:middle
This allows you to go edge to
edge with content and controls

00:11:26.496 --> 00:11:28.996 A:middle
and allows your app
to seamlessly blend

00:11:28.996 --> 00:11:30.896 A:middle
into the watch itself.

00:11:31.966 --> 00:11:34.606 A:middle
Now, the second aspect of
Holistic Design that I would

00:11:34.606 --> 00:11:37.446 A:middle
like to talk about is
fully utilizing the Force

00:11:37.526 --> 00:11:38.576 A:middle
Touch display.

00:11:40.196 --> 00:11:42.636 A:middle
Firmly pressing the
display will show a menu

00:11:43.446 --> 00:11:46.666 A:middle
if your current screen has one
added to it in the story board.

00:11:47.516 --> 00:11:49.626 A:middle
The menu control is
one of the primary ways

00:11:49.656 --> 00:11:52.226 A:middle
that people interact
with Apple Watch apps.

00:11:52.706 --> 00:11:54.796 A:middle
It provides a number
of practical

00:11:54.796 --> 00:11:57.316 A:middle
and usability benefits
to your app.

00:11:58.366 --> 00:12:02.726 A:middle
First it frees up space
so that your UI can focus



00:11:58.366 --> 00:12:02.726 A:middle
First it frees up space
so that your UI can focus

00:12:02.756 --> 00:12:05.226 A:middle
on displaying information
and content.

00:12:05.916 --> 00:12:08.646 A:middle
There's very limited space
on Apple Watch display.

00:12:09.056 --> 00:12:12.346 A:middle
The menu gives you a way to
present controls without needing

00:12:12.346 --> 00:12:15.626 A:middle
to clutter your app's UI.

00:12:15.626 --> 00:12:18.526 A:middle
For example, in the stop
watch app, there's a bunch

00:12:18.526 --> 00:12:21.986 A:middle
of different styles to choose
from, but it would be hard

00:12:21.986 --> 00:12:23.256 A:middle
to show these in the main UI.

00:12:23.896 --> 00:12:25.986 A:middle
There just really
isn't enough space.

00:12:26.716 --> 00:12:29.996 A:middle
Perhaps these controls could
be added below and accessed

00:12:30.036 --> 00:12:33.086 A:middle
by scrolling, but with the stop
watch it is really important

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:37.256 A:middle
that the time stays on screen at
all times in a fixed location.

00:12:38.366 --> 00:12:40.236 A:middle
Now, the menu plays
an instrumental role

00:12:40.236 --> 00:12:43.466 A:middle
in allowing apps like
Weather, Calendar and messages

00:12:43.466 --> 00:12:47.486 A:middle
and many other apps to focus
more on content and information.

00:12:48.816 --> 00:12:51.746 A:middle
Another huge benefit
of Menus is efficiency.

00:12:52.516 --> 00:12:56.026 A:middle
Menus make actions far
quicker for people to access.

00:12:56.736 --> 00:12:59.046 A:middle
For example, the
top level screen

00:12:59.046 --> 00:13:02.046 A:middle
in the messages app contains
a list of conversations.



00:12:59.046 --> 00:13:02.046 A:middle
in the messages app contains
a list of conversations.

00:13:02.776 --> 00:13:04.756 A:middle
The menu for the
screen has an action

00:13:04.756 --> 00:13:06.466 A:middle
to start a new conversation.

00:13:07.106 --> 00:13:09.396 A:middle
Now, if this action
wasn't in the menu,

00:13:09.966 --> 00:13:12.856 A:middle
it would probably be
displayed in line with all

00:13:12.856 --> 00:13:14.016 A:middle
of your conversations.

00:13:14.756 --> 00:13:18.456 A:middle
The trouble is, this could be
a really, really tall screen,

00:13:18.456 --> 00:13:20.886 A:middle
and what you are looking
at could be very far away

00:13:20.886 --> 00:13:22.386 A:middle
from where that action is.

00:13:23.096 --> 00:13:27.306 A:middle
And it would be hard
for people to remember

00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:30.286 A:middle
if that action was all the
way at the top of the screen

00:13:30.736 --> 00:13:33.466 A:middle
or all the way down by
the bottom of the screen.

00:13:34.286 --> 00:13:36.406 A:middle
Menus allow accessing actions

00:13:36.946 --> 00:13:39.626 A:middle
without losing your
current scroll position.

00:13:40.806 --> 00:13:46.966 A:middle
Now, Menus are also a great when
your app has a global control

00:13:46.966 --> 00:13:49.776 A:middle
that you want people to be
able to access from any screen.

00:13:50.256 --> 00:13:53.406 A:middle
So for example, in the
activity app, there's an action

00:13:53.406 --> 00:13:55.136 A:middle
for changing your
daily move goal.

00:13:55.626 --> 00:13:57.576 A:middle
This action is shown
in the menu no matter

00:13:57.686 --> 00:13:58.786 A:middle
where you are in the app.

00:13:59.726 --> 00:14:02.416 A:middle
The activity app is
structured as a page-based app.



00:13:59.726 --> 00:14:02.416 A:middle
The activity app is
structured as a page-based app.

00:14:02.416 --> 00:14:04.456 A:middle
If that control wasn't
in the menu,

00:14:05.186 --> 00:14:07.546 A:middle
it would perhaps
be in its own page.

00:14:07.946 --> 00:14:10.676 A:middle
But that would require four
swipes just to get to it

00:14:10.676 --> 00:14:11.826 A:middle
from the first screen.

00:14:12.486 --> 00:14:13.936 A:middle
By putting this action
in the menu,

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:15.566 A:middle
you simply press
the screen no matter

00:14:15.566 --> 00:14:17.326 A:middle
where you are and there it is.

00:14:18.156 --> 00:14:21.256 A:middle
Another benefit of menus is
that they can avoid redundancy.

00:14:21.846 --> 00:14:24.116 A:middle
Let's go back to the
activity app for a second.

00:14:24.476 --> 00:14:27.186 A:middle
If we didn't put this
action into a menu

00:14:27.246 --> 00:14:30.496 A:middle
or on its own screen, we
could have multiple instances

00:14:30.596 --> 00:14:32.166 A:middle
of it on every page.

00:14:32.756 --> 00:14:34.276 A:middle
But that would be
pretty redundant.

00:14:34.816 --> 00:14:37.696 A:middle
Plus it could lead people
to be incorrectly assume

00:14:37.966 --> 00:14:41.246 A:middle
that that action had something
specifically to do with the page

00:14:41.246 --> 00:14:42.956 A:middle
that they were currently
looking at.

00:14:43.306 --> 00:14:44.066 A:middle
That would be wrong.

00:14:44.636 --> 00:14:49.606 A:middle
Okay. So I've gotten a lot
of questions about what kinds

00:14:49.606 --> 00:14:51.376 A:middle
of things people
should put into a menu.

00:14:52.256 --> 00:14:54.756 A:middle
Menus are primarily
for contextual actions.

00:14:55.306 --> 00:14:58.056 A:middle
That is actions that are
relevant to the current context.

00:14:58.636 --> 00:15:00.596 A:middle
Context here refers
to two things.



00:14:58.636 --> 00:15:00.596 A:middle
Context here refers
to two things.

00:15:00.596 --> 00:15:03.926 A:middle
It could be the app or it
could be the current screen.

00:15:04.876 --> 00:15:06.996 A:middle
So activity is for
the app as a whole.

00:15:07.826 --> 00:15:10.696 A:middle
But in messages, as we saw
when you are looking at a list

00:15:10.696 --> 00:15:14.186 A:middle
of conversations, you have an
option to add a new message.

00:15:14.676 --> 00:15:15.886 A:middle
So when you are looking

00:15:15.886 --> 00:15:18.576 A:middle
at an individual
conversation, the menu changes.

00:15:19.126 --> 00:15:22.646 A:middle
A different set of actions are
appropriate for this context.

00:15:23.406 --> 00:15:25.116 A:middle
Making sure that the contents

00:15:25.116 --> 00:15:29.716 A:middle
of your menu are contextually
relevant to the app as a whole

00:15:29.716 --> 00:15:31.706 A:middle
or to the current screen
is really important.

00:15:32.346 --> 00:15:36.416 A:middle
People need to know what these
actions are going to act upon.

00:15:37.226 --> 00:15:39.846 A:middle
So in this case, it is clear
that these actions are going

00:15:39.846 --> 00:15:42.596 A:middle
to effect the current
conversation being viewed,

00:15:42.596 --> 00:15:44.966 A:middle
because that was what was
displayed before people pressed

00:15:45.136 --> 00:15:45.676 A:middle
the screen.

00:15:46.976 --> 00:15:49.856 A:middle
Another good use of menus is
for view mode preferences.

00:15:50.576 --> 00:15:54.026 A:middle
That menu with different
stop watch options is a view

00:15:54.026 --> 00:15:55.006 A:middle
mode preference.

00:15:56.046 --> 00:15:57.926 A:middle
Another example is
from the Calendar app.

00:15:58.796 --> 00:16:01.016 A:middle
There is a toggle for
switching between a list view



00:15:58.796 --> 00:16:01.016 A:middle
There is a toggle for
switching between a list view

00:16:01.016 --> 00:16:03.376 A:middle
of your schedule or a
time proportionate view

00:16:03.376 --> 00:16:04.016 A:middle
of your schedule.

00:16:04.886 --> 00:16:07.226 A:middle
View mode preferences
are highly contextual

00:16:07.226 --> 00:16:09.546 A:middle
because they affect
the appearance

00:16:09.546 --> 00:16:10.636 A:middle
of the current screen.

00:16:12.016 --> 00:16:14.596 A:middle
It is worth mentioning
that menus are optional.

00:16:14.596 --> 00:16:17.626 A:middle
There is no need to have
a menu for a given screen

00:16:17.626 --> 00:16:18.636 A:middle
if there's no actions

00:16:18.636 --> 00:16:20.286 A:middle
or preferences that
are appropriate.

00:16:21.036 --> 00:16:22.496 A:middle
And some apps might
be simple enough

00:16:22.496 --> 00:16:24.266 A:middle
that they don't need
a menu at all.

00:16:27.616 --> 00:16:31.866 A:middle
Finally, it is not always
good to put actions in a menu.

00:16:32.456 --> 00:16:36.256 A:middle
Critical path actions, meaning
actions that are necessary

00:16:36.256 --> 00:16:40.166 A:middle
for the user to continue forward
in your app and complete a task,

00:16:40.946 --> 00:16:43.026 A:middle
should not be displayed
in a menu.

00:16:43.126 --> 00:16:44.646 A:middle
They should be presented
in line.

00:16:45.316 --> 00:16:48.746 A:middle
Displaying actions in line
makes them more discoverable.

00:16:49.356 --> 00:16:51.176 A:middle
So, for example,
in the Fitness app

00:16:51.606 --> 00:16:54.506 A:middle
when we've completed a work
out, you are given this choice

00:16:54.506 --> 00:16:56.626 A:middle
to either save or
discard the information

00:16:56.626 --> 00:16:58.056 A:middle
that was recorded
for your work out.

00:16:58.686 --> 00:17:00.456 A:middle
This is not an optional
decision.



00:16:58.686 --> 00:17:00.456 A:middle
This is not an optional
decision.

00:17:00.456 --> 00:17:03.546 A:middle
You need to make the decision
one way or another in order

00:17:03.546 --> 00:17:07.226 A:middle
for you to progress
forward in the app.

00:17:07.226 --> 00:17:09.736 A:middle
In addition, if the
person's highly likely

00:17:09.736 --> 00:17:11.536 A:middle
to select a particular action,

00:17:12.046 --> 00:17:14.736 A:middle
then it should probably also
be shown in a main interface.

00:17:15.526 --> 00:17:18.076 A:middle
For example when you go
to listen to a voicemail

00:17:18.076 --> 00:17:20.626 A:middle
on the phone app, the chances
that you are going to want

00:17:20.626 --> 00:17:24.935 A:middle
to press that play button are
somewhere around 100 percent.

00:17:25.935 --> 00:17:28.296 A:middle
Right? Putting that action

00:17:28.296 --> 00:17:31.036 A:middle
in a menu would make it
needlessly inconvenient

00:17:31.036 --> 00:17:32.386 A:middle
for people to access.

00:17:33.516 --> 00:17:36.246 A:middle
And while calling the person
back who left the message

00:17:36.796 --> 00:17:39.906 A:middle
and deleting the voicemail are
definitely secondary actions,

00:17:40.296 --> 00:17:42.866 A:middle
there's still plenty of
space in this interface

00:17:42.926 --> 00:17:45.536 A:middle
to display those
controls without leading

00:17:45.536 --> 00:17:48.326 A:middle
to usability problems
or visual clutter.

00:17:49.856 --> 00:17:52.776 A:middle
The next aspect of Holistic
Design that I would like to talk

00:17:52.776 --> 00:17:54.486 A:middle
about is the Digital Crown.

00:17:56.016 --> 00:17:59.606 A:middle
The Digital Crown
enables fluid, responsive

00:17:59.706 --> 00:18:01.036 A:middle
and precise scrolling.



00:17:59.706 --> 00:18:01.036 A:middle
and precise scrolling.

00:18:01.796 --> 00:18:05.266 A:middle
So when designing your app,
don't feel like you need

00:18:05.266 --> 00:18:08.636 A:middle
to make everything visible
on screen at one time.

00:18:09.076 --> 00:18:10.256 A:middle
It is just not necessary.

00:18:11.396 --> 00:18:13.856 A:middle
So the detail screen in the
Stocks app, for example,

00:18:13.856 --> 00:18:15.666 A:middle
contains a lot of information.

00:18:16.476 --> 00:18:18.746 A:middle
Since there's no need to show
it all on screen at once,

00:18:18.786 --> 00:18:20.516 A:middle
the most important
information gets

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:22.746 A:middle
to be displayed above the fold.

00:18:23.216 --> 00:18:24.946 A:middle
It's given a lot
room to breathe,

00:18:24.946 --> 00:18:27.146 A:middle
and we can see the
current values displayed

00:18:27.146 --> 00:18:30.016 A:middle
in much larger text, it's
a nice visual presentation.

00:18:30.906 --> 00:18:32.976 A:middle
The same is true for
apps like Weather

00:18:33.776 --> 00:18:36.266 A:middle
or Activity or many others.

00:18:37.036 --> 00:18:38.946 A:middle
Trying to show everything
on screen

00:18:38.946 --> 00:18:41.516 A:middle
at once is a sure fire recipe

00:18:41.586 --> 00:18:45.276 A:middle
for having a really cramped
looking interface with text

00:18:45.276 --> 00:18:46.506 A:middle
that is too hard to read.

00:18:46.506 --> 00:18:51.716 A:middle
In WatchOS2, the Digital Crown
becomes even more powerful.

00:18:52.546 --> 00:18:54.916 A:middle
There's a new WatchKit
control called the Picker

00:18:54.916 --> 00:18:57.136 A:middle
which I'm sure many of you
have already learned about.

00:18:57.986 --> 00:18:59.986 A:middle
It gives you a lot of
great possibilities

00:18:59.986 --> 00:19:02.096 A:middle
for the design of your app.



00:18:59.986 --> 00:19:02.096 A:middle
for the design of your app.

00:19:02.096 --> 00:19:03.776 A:middle
Pickers come in three
different styles.

00:19:04.016 --> 00:19:05.626 A:middle
This is the stack style Picker.

00:19:05.626 --> 00:19:08.346 A:middle
It provides a way to navigate
and select from a list

00:19:08.346 --> 00:19:09.996 A:middle
of images or a set of images.

00:19:10.636 --> 00:19:12.816 A:middle
There's a list style
Picker which can be used

00:19:12.816 --> 00:19:15.656 A:middle
to select among an array
of text or numeric options,

00:19:16.446 --> 00:19:19.426 A:middle
and the sequence style Picker
which lets you pick an image

00:19:19.426 --> 00:19:21.896 A:middle
out of an image sequence
so you can do something

00:19:21.956 --> 00:19:23.146 A:middle
like this star rating.

00:19:23.716 --> 00:19:26.776 A:middle
And you can also use
a coordinated option

00:19:26.776 --> 00:19:29.846 A:middle
which allows you to display an
image sequence and pick an image

00:19:29.846 --> 00:19:32.966 A:middle
from the sequence to reinforce
the value of the Picker.

00:19:33.526 --> 00:19:36.626 A:middle
For example, when we
change the hour value here,

00:19:37.146 --> 00:19:40.766 A:middle
that orange arc is
being coordinated

00:19:40.766 --> 00:19:43.746 A:middle
and it reinforces the
value of the hour.

00:19:44.276 --> 00:19:47.656 A:middle
Now, the Picker allows values

00:19:47.746 --> 00:19:50.706 A:middle
to be displayed inline
and adjusted inline.

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:54.566 A:middle
This is important because
it obviates the need

00:19:54.566 --> 00:19:56.536 A:middle
for having a completely
separate interface

00:19:56.536 --> 00:19:57.786 A:middle
for changing a selection.

00:19:58.436 --> 00:20:00.246 A:middle
As a result, it can
make interactions



00:19:58.436 --> 00:20:00.246 A:middle
As a result, it can
make interactions

00:20:00.246 --> 00:20:02.626 A:middle
with your Watch app
far more efficient,

00:20:03.566 --> 00:20:07.936 A:middle
and making selections inline
allows you to retain context.

00:20:08.536 --> 00:20:10.286 A:middle
When we're adjusting
the data value,

00:20:10.286 --> 00:20:12.516 A:middle
it's nice that we can
see what the month

00:20:12.516 --> 00:20:16.046 A:middle
and year is at the same time.

00:20:17.256 --> 00:20:20.516 A:middle
When using a Picker,
there's a few options

00:20:20.516 --> 00:20:21.506 A:middle
that you should be aware of.

00:20:22.176 --> 00:20:24.046 A:middle
First, Pickers have outlines.

00:20:24.386 --> 00:20:26.326 A:middle
Outlines help people
to understand

00:20:26.326 --> 00:20:30.006 A:middle
that a Picker has focus,
meaning people understand

00:20:30.006 --> 00:20:33.836 A:middle
that when they rotate the
Digital Crown, the outline,

00:20:33.836 --> 00:20:36.536 A:middle
the value that is outlined
in green will be adjusted.

00:20:37.106 --> 00:20:39.426 A:middle
This is important when you
have two or more Pickers

00:20:39.426 --> 00:20:41.466 A:middle
that are displayed on
screen at the same time.

00:20:42.046 --> 00:20:45.346 A:middle
In the example of the timer
app, the outlines let us know

00:20:45.346 --> 00:20:47.516 A:middle
that both hour and
minutes can be adjusted

00:20:47.856 --> 00:20:52.506 A:middle
and which one will respond to
rotations of the Digital Crown.

00:20:53.806 --> 00:20:55.556 A:middle
Outlines are not always needed.

00:20:56.056 --> 00:20:58.686 A:middle
So in this example, there
is no need for an outline

00:20:58.686 --> 00:21:00.286 A:middle
because there's only
one Picker on screen.



00:20:58.686 --> 00:21:00.286 A:middle
because there's only
one Picker on screen.

00:21:00.976 --> 00:21:03.866 A:middle
However, if this
screen were to scroll,

00:21:03.866 --> 00:21:06.136 A:middle
an outline would be
needed because people need

00:21:06.136 --> 00:21:08.956 A:middle
to know whether rotating the
Digital Crown will scroll the

00:21:08.956 --> 00:21:10.886 A:middle
screen or adjust
the Picker value.

00:21:12.126 --> 00:21:13.676 A:middle
You can also add a caption

00:21:13.676 --> 00:21:16.576 A:middle
if it's not clear what the
items in your Picker are.

00:21:16.706 --> 00:21:19.466 A:middle
For example, when you
are selecting different

00:21:19.466 --> 00:21:21.466 A:middle
complications, some
of these items aren't

00:21:21.466 --> 00:21:22.956 A:middle
totally self-explanatory.

00:21:23.406 --> 00:21:25.926 A:middle
They require a caption
to explain what they are.

00:21:27.326 --> 00:21:31.186 A:middle
Now, captions are set on a per
item basis, but if every item

00:21:31.486 --> 00:21:33.796 A:middle
in the Picker has the same
caption, it will serve

00:21:33.796 --> 00:21:35.486 A:middle
as a label for the
Picker itself.

00:21:35.856 --> 00:21:39.886 A:middle
Okay. The last setting
that you need to be aware

00:21:39.886 --> 00:21:43.066 A:middle
of is the contextual
indicator or scroll indicator.

00:21:43.396 --> 00:21:45.926 A:middle
It displays when the
Digital Crown is rotated.

00:21:46.486 --> 00:21:48.346 A:middle
The contextual indicator
is useful

00:21:48.346 --> 00:21:51.686 A:middle
for helping people understand
about how many options they have

00:21:51.686 --> 00:21:54.436 A:middle
to choose from and where
they are in that list.

00:21:54.856 --> 00:22:00.226 A:middle
Now, the last aspect of
Holistic Design that I would



00:21:54.856 --> 00:22:00.226 A:middle
Now, the last aspect of
Holistic Design that I would

00:22:00.226 --> 00:22:03.416 A:middle
like to discuss with you today
involves the Taptic Engine.

00:22:04.016 --> 00:22:09.196 A:middle
And in WatchOS2 two
your apps will be able

00:22:09.196 --> 00:22:11.766 A:middle
to create haptic
feedback as many

00:22:11.766 --> 00:22:13.296 A:middle
of our built-in apps do today.

00:22:14.136 --> 00:22:16.766 A:middle
Each haptic pattern
is complemented

00:22:16.766 --> 00:22:18.526 A:middle
by a very brief audio tone.

00:22:19.286 --> 00:22:23.756 A:middle
By using the sense of touch and
sound to provide user feedback

00:22:24.026 --> 00:22:26.936 A:middle
in addition to the visual cues
that people see on the screen,

00:22:27.476 --> 00:22:30.656 A:middle
Apple Watch apps can
create a deeply immersive

00:22:30.836 --> 00:22:32.136 A:middle
user experience.

00:22:33.536 --> 00:22:35.896 A:middle
There are nine different
types of haptic feedback

00:22:35.946 --> 00:22:37.876 A:middle
for you to choose from.

00:22:37.876 --> 00:22:41.006 A:middle
I'd like through each one with
you and show you an example

00:22:41.006 --> 00:22:42.156 A:middle
of how they should be used.

00:22:43.256 --> 00:22:45.436 A:middle
When I prepared this
presentation,

00:22:45.436 --> 00:22:48.656 A:middle
I realized it's hard to
talk about haptic feedback

00:22:48.656 --> 00:22:50.136 A:middle
when you guys won't be able

00:22:50.136 --> 00:22:52.056 A:middle
to experience how
these things feel.

00:22:52.996 --> 00:22:58.126 A:middle
So I got a little bit of
budget allocated, and I had all

00:22:58.126 --> 00:23:01.116 A:middle
of your chairs rigged
with 14 super high powered



00:22:58.126 --> 00:23:01.116 A:middle
of your chairs rigged
with 14 super high powered

00:23:01.116 --> 00:23:02.346 A:middle
Taptic Engines.

00:23:03.106 --> 00:23:04.496 A:middle
I hope you guys are
ready for this.

00:23:05.916 --> 00:23:06.356 A:middle
Just kidding.

00:23:07.816 --> 00:23:10.306 A:middle
That's why I would like
to show you a diagram

00:23:10.306 --> 00:23:13.866 A:middle
of how each haptic pattern
and audio wave form work

00:23:13.866 --> 00:23:15.226 A:middle
in conjunction with each other.

00:23:16.486 --> 00:23:19.276 A:middle
So, for example, this is
the notification haptic.

00:23:20.016 --> 00:23:22.276 A:middle
The magenta shape
represents points in time

00:23:22.276 --> 00:23:24.936 A:middle
where the Taptic
Engine would be active

00:23:24.936 --> 00:23:28.216 A:middle
and the wave form obviously
represents the audio tone.

00:23:29.236 --> 00:23:30.926 A:middle
Let's hear how notification
sounds.

00:23:31.516 --> 00:23:33.566 A:middle
[Sound]

00:23:34.066 --> 00:23:36.076 A:middle
This haptic plays when
you receive a push

00:23:36.076 --> 00:23:37.296 A:middle
for local notification.

00:23:37.976 --> 00:23:39.966 A:middle
Now you can use this
in your app as well.

00:23:40.536 --> 00:23:42.016 A:middle
Let's look at it in context.

00:23:45.276 --> 00:23:47.276 A:middle
[Tone]

00:23:47.536 --> 00:23:50.906 A:middle
The notification haptic,
and audio tone is good

00:23:50.906 --> 00:23:53.986 A:middle
for alerting people when
something significant or out

00:23:53.986 --> 00:23:57.386 A:middle
of the ordinary has occurred
and requires their attention.

00:23:58.496 --> 00:24:02.066 A:middle
The direction up and
direction down haptic is useful



00:23:58.496 --> 00:24:02.066 A:middle
The direction up and
direction down haptic is useful

00:24:02.066 --> 00:24:02.926 A:middle
for alerting people

00:24:02.926 --> 00:24:05.746 A:middle
when a really significant
value has crossed

00:24:05.746 --> 00:24:08.706 A:middle
above some significant
threshold or crossed below it.

00:24:09.306 --> 00:24:10.306 A:middle
Let's hear how that sounds.

00:24:10.846 --> 00:24:12.656 A:middle
[Tone] That's up.

00:24:13.576 --> 00:24:17.446 A:middle
And down. [Tone] Let's
see that in context.

00:24:19.516 --> 00:24:23.906 A:middle
[Tone, tone, tone.

00:24:24.406 --> 00:24:28.796 A:middle
Tone, tone, tone]

00:24:29.296 --> 00:24:33.726 A:middle
The success haptic provides a
confirmation tone to indicate

00:24:33.726 --> 00:24:35.846 A:middle
that an action has
completed successfully.

00:24:37.106 --> 00:24:39.896 A:middle
[Tone] That has a nice
ring to it, right?

00:24:40.396 --> 00:24:41.146 A:middle
Very positive.

00:24:41.816 --> 00:24:43.016 A:middle
In context.

00:24:43.746 --> 00:24:48.446 A:middle
[Tone] So this tone
is really good

00:24:48.686 --> 00:24:50.566 A:middle
for providing people
positive feedback

00:24:51.126 --> 00:24:53.346 A:middle
like they are taking a quiz
and they got an answer right

00:24:53.346 --> 00:24:55.436 A:middle
or playing a game and
they completed a level.

00:24:56.566 --> 00:24:59.376 A:middle
Here is the failure
haptic, the arch nemesis

00:24:59.376 --> 00:25:00.436 A:middle
of the success haptic.



00:24:59.376 --> 00:25:00.436 A:middle
of the success haptic.

00:25:01.626 --> 00:25:03.396 A:middle
Hear how that sounds.

00:25:04.636 --> 00:25:06.376 A:middle
[Tone] The failure
haptic indicates

00:25:06.376 --> 00:25:08.076 A:middle
that an action failed
to perform.

00:25:10.196 --> 00:25:14.866 A:middle
[Tone] That's discouraging,
pretty negative.

00:25:15.326 --> 00:25:17.766 A:middle
Generally you wouldn't
want to fail on someone

00:25:17.766 --> 00:25:19.706 A:middle
and not give people
options for a try.

00:25:20.106 --> 00:25:22.566 A:middle
It's better to do
something like this.

00:25:23.966 --> 00:25:26.536 A:middle
[Tone] And see that in context.

00:25:30.976 --> 00:25:34.306 A:middle
[Tone] This tone is
a bit more forgiving.

00:25:34.306 --> 00:25:37.526 A:middle
It tells people, "Hey, it
didn't work out very well,

00:25:37.526 --> 00:25:38.876 A:middle
but okay, no big deal.

00:25:38.916 --> 00:25:41.856 A:middle
You can totally try again.

00:25:41.896 --> 00:25:44.206 A:middle
" There are also tones for
starting an activity [Tone.],

00:25:44.616 --> 00:25:47.476 A:middle
and stopping an activity.

00:25:49.216 --> 00:25:51.116 A:middle
[Tone, tone] Here
they are in context.

00:25:52.026 --> 00:25:57.846 A:middle
[Tone, pause, tone, tone] As
the illustration suggests,

00:25:57.846 --> 00:26:02.156 A:middle
these are good for timers or
your Watch starts playback



00:25:57.846 --> 00:26:02.156 A:middle
these are good for timers or
your Watch starts playback

00:26:02.156 --> 00:26:05.886 A:middle
or recording on a
companion iOS app.

00:26:05.886 --> 00:26:08.606 A:middle
Finally there's a special

00:26:08.776 --> 00:26:11.646 A:middle
and subtle haptic
called a click haptic.

00:26:12.376 --> 00:26:14.966 A:middle
This one as I said
is a bit special.

00:26:15.066 --> 00:26:17.786 A:middle
As you can see it's far
more quiet and brief

00:26:17.886 --> 00:26:19.956 A:middle
than others we just looked at.

00:26:19.956 --> 00:26:22.526 A:middle
In fact I wasn't sure everyone
would be able to hear it,

00:26:22.766 --> 00:26:28.116 A:middle
so I artificially normalized its
audio level so it is much more

00:26:28.186 --> 00:26:30.636 A:middle
like the others but in
reality it's a bit more quiet.

00:26:31.186 --> 00:26:36.516 A:middle
[Click] Let's hear that again.

00:26:36.736 --> 00:26:37.916 A:middle
[Click] Very quick, right?

00:26:38.686 --> 00:26:42.386 A:middle
This haptic provides the
sensation of a dial clicking

00:26:42.786 --> 00:26:45.986 A:middle
at predefined increments
or intervals.

00:26:46.526 --> 00:26:50.776 A:middle
[Clicking sound] This haptic is
good for things like this dial.

00:26:56.256 --> 00:26:58.686 A:middle
[Clicking sound]
Now, if you notice,

00:26:58.686 --> 00:27:01.676 A:middle
this dial has minor tick
marks and major tick marks.



00:26:58.686 --> 00:27:01.676 A:middle
this dial has minor tick
marks and major tick marks.

00:27:02.276 --> 00:27:05.026 A:middle
I only played this click
sound at the major tick marks

00:27:05.066 --> 00:27:07.836 A:middle
because you don't want
every little tick mark

00:27:07.836 --> 00:27:08.936 A:middle
to cause this click.

00:27:08.936 --> 00:27:10.266 A:middle
It would be too much.

00:27:11.656 --> 00:27:15.106 A:middle
Even playing at the major
tick marks could be too much.

00:27:16.046 --> 00:27:17.476 A:middle
The thing is, about haptics,

00:27:17.476 --> 00:27:19.276 A:middle
they can't overlap
with each other.

00:27:19.766 --> 00:27:22.106 A:middle
So let me play an illustration
of what we just saw.

00:27:23.516 --> 00:27:26.896 A:middle
[Clicking]

00:27:27.396 --> 00:27:30.496 A:middle
You can see here there's plenty
of space in between these clicks

00:27:30.816 --> 00:27:32.536 A:middle
for them to individually play

00:27:32.536 --> 00:27:34.456 A:middle
without them stomping
on each other.

00:27:35.336 --> 00:27:38.036 A:middle
But if we were adjusting this
volume with the Digital Crown,

00:27:38.036 --> 00:27:39.986 A:middle
that's fine if we're
rotating slowlily.

00:27:40.536 --> 00:27:42.396 A:middle
What if we did a quick
twist and it went

00:27:42.396 --> 00:27:43.866 A:middle
through those values
very quickly.

00:27:45.206 --> 00:27:46.826 A:middle
It would look more like this.

00:27:47.546 --> 00:27:49.906 A:middle
Now, the thing is,
this can't happen.

00:27:50.486 --> 00:27:52.906 A:middle
The Taptic Engine will
prevent these haptics

00:27:52.906 --> 00:27:54.616 A:middle
from playing simultaneously.

00:27:55.756 --> 00:28:01.246 A:middle
Instead it will play
the ones that it can.



00:27:55.756 --> 00:28:01.246 A:middle
Instead it will play
the ones that it can.

00:28:01.456 --> 00:28:04.166 A:middle
Now, this would result
in people hearing

00:28:04.166 --> 00:28:06.586 A:middle
and feeling less feedback
when they go quickly

00:28:06.586 --> 00:28:08.086 A:middle
than if they had gone slowly.

00:28:10.556 --> 00:28:12.196 A:middle
[Clicking noise]: We
only heard two cliques

00:28:12.766 --> 00:28:14.106 A:middle
when before we heard five.

00:28:14.576 --> 00:28:15.796 A:middle
That would lead to confusion

00:28:15.796 --> 00:28:19.106 A:middle
about how much the
value had been adjusted.

00:28:19.106 --> 00:28:21.586 A:middle
With this haptic,
use it judiciously.

00:28:22.276 --> 00:28:23.886 A:middle
Exercise restraint.

00:28:24.776 --> 00:28:29.176 A:middle
Just remember that haptics
can't play simultaneously.

00:28:29.176 --> 00:28:31.886 A:middle
For all haptics this
is good advice.

00:28:32.906 --> 00:28:35.976 A:middle
You should use them sparingly
to draw people's attention

00:28:36.246 --> 00:28:38.616 A:middle
to truly important
events in your app.

00:28:38.936 --> 00:28:41.386 A:middle
Their effectiveness
will diminish greatly

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:45.266 A:middle
if everything a person does in
their app causes their watch

00:28:45.526 --> 00:28:47.056 A:middle
to vibrate and make sounds.

00:28:48.256 --> 00:28:52.346 A:middle
And please use these
haptic tones and patterns

00:28:52.346 --> 00:28:54.586 A:middle
as they were intended
to be used.

00:28:55.296 --> 00:28:58.276 A:middle
If haptic and auditory
feedback isn't used consistently

00:28:58.276 --> 00:29:01.226 A:middle
across all of the apps that
we make, they are going



00:28:58.276 --> 00:29:01.226 A:middle
across all of the apps that
we make, they are going

00:29:01.226 --> 00:29:02.156 A:middle
to lose their meaning.

00:29:02.506 --> 00:29:03.676 A:middle
We are all in this together.

00:29:04.056 --> 00:29:06.206 A:middle
We need to use these as they
are supposed to be used.

00:29:07.346 --> 00:29:11.076 A:middle
Okay. So quick recap
about Holistic Design.

00:29:11.466 --> 00:29:14.156 A:middle
Holistic Design is about
blurring the physical boundaries

00:29:14.156 --> 00:29:17.896 A:middle
between software and
hardware, getting your UI

00:29:17.896 --> 00:29:22.066 A:middle
to match the bezel color and
utilizing the Digital Crown

00:29:22.066 --> 00:29:24.896 A:middle
and the Force Touch display
and the Taptic Engine

00:29:25.176 --> 00:29:28.506 A:middle
to create a seamless connection
between software and hardware.

00:29:29.436 --> 00:29:33.526 A:middle
Okay. So let's move on to
the last major design theme

00:29:33.526 --> 00:29:36.776 A:middle
for Apple Watch and that
is lightweight interaction.

00:29:37.666 --> 00:29:39.836 A:middle
Lightweight interaction
means taking advantage

00:29:39.836 --> 00:29:42.796 A:middle
of the Watch's unique
position on the user's wrist

00:29:43.366 --> 00:29:45.806 A:middle
by offering them quick
and convenient access

00:29:45.856 --> 00:29:47.386 A:middle
to information and actions.

00:29:48.326 --> 00:29:51.256 A:middle
Interaction times in Apple
Watch are far more brief

00:29:51.666 --> 00:29:53.996 A:middle
than on an iPad or iPhone.

00:29:54.616 --> 00:29:58.526 A:middle
Interaction times on those
devices could be in the minutes

00:29:58.526 --> 00:30:01.336 A:middle
or even hours, whereas
interaction times



00:29:58.526 --> 00:30:01.336 A:middle
or even hours, whereas
interaction times

00:30:01.336 --> 00:30:03.416 A:middle
in Apple Watch are just
a matter of seconds.

00:30:04.426 --> 00:30:07.816 A:middle
Our internal metric for
interaction times is

00:30:07.816 --> 00:30:10.316 A:middle
about five seconds or less.

00:30:11.076 --> 00:30:13.726 A:middle
Checking your schedule,
going for a run,

00:30:14.076 --> 00:30:17.036 A:middle
replying to a text shouldn't
take longer than this.

00:30:18.206 --> 00:30:22.106 A:middle
You need to seriously consider
this when designing your app.

00:30:22.976 --> 00:30:25.656 A:middle
Designing for such
short interaction times

00:30:25.726 --> 00:30:26.996 A:middle
requires focus.

00:30:27.256 --> 00:30:31.036 A:middle
It requires focusing on the
most essential information

00:30:31.036 --> 00:30:33.716 A:middle
and actions and presenting
them as clearly

00:30:33.806 --> 00:30:35.376 A:middle
and legibly as possible.

00:30:36.256 --> 00:30:39.356 A:middle
You may need to drop
features if it takes too long

00:30:39.356 --> 00:30:41.326 A:middle
for people to accomplish tasks.

00:30:42.096 --> 00:30:43.926 A:middle
With that in mind, let's
look at how the concept

00:30:43.926 --> 00:30:47.636 A:middle
of lightweight can influence
how you design Glances,

00:30:47.676 --> 00:30:49.176 A:middle
Notifications and apps.

00:30:50.176 --> 00:30:51.266 A:middle
Let's start with Glances.

00:30:51.886 --> 00:30:54.606 A:middle
The name says it all,
it speaks volumes.

00:30:55.246 --> 00:30:58.396 A:middle
Glances are scannable
summaries of the information

00:30:58.396 --> 00:31:00.426 A:middle
that people seek
out most frequently



00:30:58.396 --> 00:31:00.426 A:middle
that people seek
out most frequently

00:31:00.806 --> 00:31:02.106 A:middle
from their favorite apps.

00:31:02.856 --> 00:31:06.226 A:middle
Your Glance may only be seen
on screen for a brief moment

00:31:06.226 --> 00:31:08.956 A:middle
in time as people swipe
from one Glance to another.

00:31:09.596 --> 00:31:12.896 A:middle
So focus on showing only the
most essential information

00:31:12.896 --> 00:31:16.306 A:middle
from your app and display
it as clearly as possible.

00:31:17.126 --> 00:31:19.796 A:middle
The purpose of the Weather
Glance is very clear.

00:31:20.306 --> 00:31:22.516 A:middle
Show people the current
weather conditions

00:31:22.516 --> 00:31:23.716 A:middle
in their current location.

00:31:24.456 --> 00:31:27.666 A:middle
This information is timely and
it's contextually relevant,

00:31:27.666 --> 00:31:30.256 A:middle
and it is the information
that people seek

00:31:30.256 --> 00:31:32.566 A:middle
out most frequently
from the Weather app.

00:31:33.706 --> 00:31:36.176 A:middle
Usually it's the only thing
that they want to know.

00:31:36.936 --> 00:31:39.566 A:middle
If they want to know
more like the forecast,

00:31:39.936 --> 00:31:41.656 A:middle
tapping the glance
will deep link

00:31:41.736 --> 00:31:44.236 A:middle
to an appropriate detail
screen within the app.

00:31:45.386 --> 00:31:48.046 A:middle
So even though the Glance
only shows a little bit

00:31:48.046 --> 00:31:51.986 A:middle
of information, more information
is just one tap away.

00:31:53.076 --> 00:31:56.096 A:middle
Try to strike a similar
balance with your Glance.

00:31:56.896 --> 00:31:58.726 A:middle
Display the most
frequently sought

00:31:58.726 --> 00:32:01.006 A:middle
after information from your app.



00:31:58.726 --> 00:32:01.006 A:middle
after information from your app.

00:32:01.876 --> 00:32:05.506 A:middle
Show information that is timely
and contextually relevant.

00:32:06.536 --> 00:32:09.276 A:middle
And make it easy for people
to get more information

00:32:09.376 --> 00:32:10.316 A:middle
by deep linking

00:32:10.316 --> 00:32:13.536 A:middle
to an appropriate
screen within your app.

00:32:13.536 --> 00:32:16.666 A:middle
And in addition, it is important
to communicate as clearly

00:32:16.666 --> 00:32:18.116 A:middle
and as efficiently as possible.

00:32:18.116 --> 00:32:20.956 A:middle
Even if you are only
showing just a few key pieces

00:32:20.956 --> 00:32:23.786 A:middle
of information, some of that
data might be more important

00:32:23.786 --> 00:32:24.496 A:middle
than the rest.

00:32:24.716 --> 00:32:27.596 A:middle
In the Weather Glance,
we immediately focus

00:32:27.596 --> 00:32:30.616 A:middle
on the current temperature
because it's so much larger

00:32:30.616 --> 00:32:32.766 A:middle
and brighter than the
rest of the information.

00:32:33.396 --> 00:32:35.906 A:middle
When there's just a few
elements on the screen,

00:32:36.076 --> 00:32:38.366 A:middle
there's more space for you
to do something like that

00:32:38.706 --> 00:32:42.636 A:middle
to draw people's attention to
one really key piece of data.

00:32:43.756 --> 00:32:46.376 A:middle
Graphics are also
a really good way

00:32:46.376 --> 00:32:48.466 A:middle
to communicate clearly
and efficiently.

00:32:48.986 --> 00:32:50.806 A:middle
The icon here makes it clear

00:32:50.806 --> 00:32:52.956 A:middle
that it is partly
cloudy outside.

00:32:53.736 --> 00:32:57.056 A:middle
Animations and graphs
are also great

00:32:57.096 --> 00:32:59.686 A:middle
for communicating
efficiently in your Glance.



00:33:00.686 --> 00:33:02.706 A:middle
It is also usually a good idea

00:33:02.706 --> 00:33:04.986 A:middle
to left align content
in your Glance.

00:33:05.826 --> 00:33:08.686 A:middle
Left aligned text for
most languages, at least,

00:33:09.206 --> 00:33:12.046 A:middle
tends to be more scannable
and it looks more orderly,

00:33:12.576 --> 00:33:15.386 A:middle
and it will help your
Glance to feel right at home

00:33:15.386 --> 00:33:17.116 A:middle
in the overall Glance UI.

00:33:18.676 --> 00:33:21.516 A:middle
Now when you start to design
your Glances, it is important

00:33:21.516 --> 00:33:23.736 A:middle
to know that Glances are
constructed from templates.

00:33:25.086 --> 00:33:28.016 A:middle
Glances are made by
combining one upper template

00:33:28.086 --> 00:33:30.316 A:middle
and one lower template.

00:33:31.756 --> 00:33:33.156 A:middle
This is a modular system.

00:33:33.586 --> 00:33:37.176 A:middle
There are 12 upper templates
and 24 lower templates

00:33:37.176 --> 00:33:38.236 A:middle
for you to choose from.

00:33:39.246 --> 00:33:41.506 A:middle
To make your Glance, you
just pick one of each.

00:33:42.306 --> 00:33:45.306 A:middle
Now, Glance templates
partially determine the size

00:33:45.366 --> 00:33:48.156 A:middle
and appearance of text,
which helps to ensure

00:33:48.156 --> 00:33:49.626 A:middle
that they are highly legible.

00:33:50.436 --> 00:33:53.826 A:middle
And Glance are also designed to
follow a consistent layout grid.

00:33:54.426 --> 00:33:55.976 A:middle
This helps to provide an element

00:33:55.976 --> 00:33:58.046 A:middle
of consistency across
all Glances.

00:33:58.596 --> 00:34:02.046 A:middle
Without this structure, the
overall Glance UI would start



00:33:58.596 --> 00:34:02.046 A:middle
Without this structure, the
overall Glance UI would start

00:34:02.046 --> 00:34:05.156 A:middle
to feel really cobbled together,
and that wouldn't be very great.

00:34:06.406 --> 00:34:08.326 A:middle
Enough about Glances.

00:34:08.766 --> 00:34:10.275 A:middle
Let's move on to notifications.

00:34:10.846 --> 00:34:14.946 A:middle
Notifications are a key aspect
of many Apple Watch experiences.

00:34:15.726 --> 00:34:18.456 A:middle
Notifications are all about
lightweight interaction.

00:34:19.516 --> 00:34:21.476 A:middle
The purpose of a notification is

00:34:21.505 --> 00:34:24.666 A:middle
to communicate high value
information clearly,

00:34:24.786 --> 00:34:26.126 A:middle
quickly and succinctly.

00:34:26.806 --> 00:34:30.516 A:middle
In order to accomplish this,
you want to use as few words

00:34:30.516 --> 00:34:34.766 A:middle
as possible and avoid
any unnecessary details.

00:34:35.636 --> 00:34:38.246 A:middle
Now even though the height
of a notification can scale

00:34:38.246 --> 00:34:41.065 A:middle
to accommodate its contents,
people don't want to read a lot

00:34:41.065 --> 00:34:42.806 A:middle
of text on their Apple Watch.

00:34:43.545 --> 00:34:44.806 A:middle
Get to the point quickly.

00:34:45.786 --> 00:34:48.936 A:middle
The notification that Calendar
sends when a meeting has started

00:34:48.936 --> 00:34:50.886 A:middle
and maybe you're running
a little bit late,

00:34:51.516 --> 00:34:52.926 A:middle
that's a good example of this.

00:34:53.246 --> 00:34:56.536 A:middle
There is no unnecessary
information or fluffy language.

00:34:56.976 --> 00:34:59.456 A:middle
Thirty-three minutes
ago, which meeting?



00:35:00.756 --> 00:35:03.236 A:middle
Today. 4:30 to 5:30.

00:35:03.946 --> 00:35:09.756 A:middle
Not this. As with Glances, if
people want to know more detail,

00:35:10.146 --> 00:35:12.856 A:middle
your notification
can offer a deep link

00:35:13.036 --> 00:35:15.466 A:middle
into an appropriate
screen in your app.

00:35:16.696 --> 00:35:18.956 A:middle
Now, most notifications
contain only text.

00:35:19.356 --> 00:35:20.046 A:middle
And that's great.

00:35:20.476 --> 00:35:23.066 A:middle
But in some cases
you can use graphics

00:35:23.106 --> 00:35:24.446 A:middle
to communicate more quickly.

00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:27.076 A:middle
Like this notification
from the fitness

00:35:27.076 --> 00:35:28.946 A:middle
and diet tracker app Life Sum.

00:35:29.416 --> 00:35:32.566 A:middle
They use graphics for many of
the notifications they send.

00:35:33.216 --> 00:35:36.146 A:middle
Obviously this one is a
reminder to drink water.

00:35:37.276 --> 00:35:38.236 A:middle
But the real power

00:35:38.236 --> 00:35:41.256 A:middle
of notifications isn't
just how they inform people

00:35:41.466 --> 00:35:42.856 A:middle
about the things that matter.

00:35:43.256 --> 00:35:46.266 A:middle
They are also a convenient
way for people to take action.

00:35:47.126 --> 00:35:49.646 A:middle
By seeing actions
presented in a notification,

00:35:50.126 --> 00:35:52.336 A:middle
people know that it's
possible to take action

00:35:52.666 --> 00:35:55.196 A:middle
and they know what their
choices for acting are.

00:35:56.536 --> 00:35:59.866 A:middle
Interactive notifications
are really about triage.



00:36:00.326 --> 00:36:01.886 A:middle
You should think
about it in this way.

00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:05.276 A:middle
People receive timely
or urgent information

00:36:05.556 --> 00:36:07.256 A:middle
and they can take
immediate action.

00:36:07.966 --> 00:36:11.526 A:middle
Only display the most
relevant action or actions.

00:36:12.336 --> 00:36:15.936 A:middle
So, for example, the new message
notification gives you just one

00:36:15.936 --> 00:36:17.406 A:middle
option, to reply.

00:36:18.306 --> 00:36:20.416 A:middle
Now, other actions could
have been presented here,

00:36:20.666 --> 00:36:22.826 A:middle
but this is hands-down
the most likely choice

00:36:22.876 --> 00:36:24.316 A:middle
that anyone would want to make.

00:36:24.876 --> 00:36:28.376 A:middle
Okay. Enough about
notifications.

00:36:29.036 --> 00:36:31.816 A:middle
Let's turn to how you can
support lightweight interaction

00:36:32.106 --> 00:36:33.016 A:middle
in your apps.

00:36:33.756 --> 00:36:36.776 A:middle
Apps and games in Apple
Watch should be far simpler

00:36:36.806 --> 00:36:39.676 A:middle
than the typical
iPhone app or game.

00:36:40.946 --> 00:36:45.266 A:middle
You must always remember Apple
Watch is not a miniature iPhone.

00:36:45.626 --> 00:36:49.756 A:middle
I have seen countless developers
trying to take the entirety

00:36:49.756 --> 00:36:54.106 A:middle
of their iPhone app experience
and cram it into a Watch app.

00:36:54.746 --> 00:36:57.116 A:middle
That is a recipe for disaster.

00:36:57.536 --> 00:37:01.426 A:middle
It leads to overly complicated
apps that are difficult



00:36:57.536 --> 00:37:01.426 A:middle
It leads to overly complicated
apps that are difficult

00:37:01.426 --> 00:37:03.906 A:middle
or impossible to
use and navigate.

00:37:04.796 --> 00:37:07.846 A:middle
To be totally clear, making
an Apple Watch app to be

00:37:07.846 --> 00:37:10.046 A:middle
like your iPhone
app is a non-goal.

00:37:11.096 --> 00:37:14.576 A:middle
The goal instead should be
to design an Apple Watch app

00:37:14.576 --> 00:37:16.896 A:middle
that complements
your iPhone app.

00:37:17.466 --> 00:37:21.326 A:middle
This may involve hand picking
just one or two key functions

00:37:21.626 --> 00:37:23.356 A:middle
and bringing it over
to Apple Watch.

00:37:24.406 --> 00:37:27.296 A:middle
Or it could be creating an
entirely different experience

00:37:27.836 --> 00:37:28.726 A:middle
for Apple Watch.

00:37:29.856 --> 00:37:32.056 A:middle
Whatever you do, focus
on the essentials.

00:37:32.486 --> 00:37:35.666 A:middle
Don't present too much
information or functionality.

00:37:36.406 --> 00:37:39.576 A:middle
Only include the things
that people truly want quick

00:37:39.576 --> 00:37:41.096 A:middle
and convenient access to.

00:37:42.076 --> 00:37:43.736 A:middle
Let's look at a couple
of examples.

00:37:44.666 --> 00:37:48.526 A:middle
Green Kitchen on iOS is an
awesome cooking app with lots

00:37:48.526 --> 00:37:51.266 A:middle
of delicious recipes,
ingredient lists

00:37:51.386 --> 00:37:52.796 A:middle
and step-by-step instructions.

00:37:53.826 --> 00:37:57.676 A:middle
Technically they could have
done all of this on Apple Watch,

00:37:58.446 --> 00:38:01.106 A:middle
but they took a different
approach and focused



00:37:58.446 --> 00:38:01.106 A:middle
but they took a different
approach and focused

00:38:01.106 --> 00:38:03.706 A:middle
on something simple
which is timers.

00:38:04.516 --> 00:38:06.866 A:middle
While you are cooking with one
of their recipes, you'll notice

00:38:06.866 --> 00:38:09.826 A:middle
that the times are highlighted
in green, and if you tap one

00:38:09.826 --> 00:38:13.346 A:middle
of those times, it will start
a timer which you can monitor

00:38:13.346 --> 00:38:18.306 A:middle
on your iPhone but also
monitor it on your Apple Watch.

00:38:19.276 --> 00:38:21.806 A:middle
Their Apple Watch app is
a quick and convenient way

00:38:21.806 --> 00:38:24.456 A:middle
to see how much time is
left in the current step.

00:38:25.266 --> 00:38:26.326 A:middle
Of course you can choose

00:38:26.326 --> 00:38:29.616 A:middle
to receive notifications
when the timer is up.

00:38:30.546 --> 00:38:33.276 A:middle
Let's look at the
New York Times app.

00:38:33.346 --> 00:38:38.036 A:middle
Now, on the iPhone they have
tons and tons of content.

00:38:38.786 --> 00:38:40.656 A:middle
You can access all
of their editorials

00:38:40.656 --> 00:38:41.956 A:middle
and articles and more.

00:38:42.596 --> 00:38:46.426 A:middle
Again, doing this on Apple
Watch is technically possible,

00:38:46.426 --> 00:38:49.316 A:middle
but it would be a
terrible, terrible idea.

00:38:49.316 --> 00:38:50.006 A:middle
Don't do that.

00:38:50.706 --> 00:38:52.276 A:middle
Just browsing through the list

00:38:52.276 --> 00:38:54.936 A:middle
of sections alone would
take way too long.

00:38:55.326 --> 00:38:57.106 A:middle
No one in their right mind wants

00:38:57.106 --> 00:38:59.256 A:middle
to read a thousand word
article on their wrist.



00:39:00.326 --> 00:39:02.206 A:middle
Instead the New York Times app

00:39:02.206 --> 00:39:06.226 A:middle
for Apple Watch only shows
a curated set of top stories

00:39:06.916 --> 00:39:10.396 A:middle
that their editorial team
has hand crafted just

00:39:10.396 --> 00:39:11.406 A:middle
for the Apple Watch.

00:39:12.276 --> 00:39:14.856 A:middle
They only show what they
believe are the most important

00:39:14.856 --> 00:39:16.396 A:middle
and timely news stories.

00:39:17.246 --> 00:39:20.296 A:middle
Each story is really
just a quick synopsis.

00:39:20.856 --> 00:39:23.246 A:middle
It is not, they are not
displaying full articles.

00:39:24.206 --> 00:39:27.116 A:middle
Reading the full story
would take way more

00:39:27.346 --> 00:39:29.466 A:middle
than two to five seconds.

00:39:30.996 --> 00:39:33.976 A:middle
If people want to continue
reading, there's a save

00:39:33.976 --> 00:39:37.056 A:middle
for later action in the menu
so they can bookmark a story

00:39:37.056 --> 00:39:38.856 A:middle
and read it later on
the iPhone or iPad.

00:39:39.856 --> 00:39:42.536 A:middle
Or they can take
out their iPhone

00:39:42.956 --> 00:39:44.216 A:middle
and continue reading more.

00:39:44.846 --> 00:39:46.546 A:middle
It's natural behavior.

00:39:47.196 --> 00:39:51.236 A:middle
That is why it's so important
to implement hand-off.

00:39:52.326 --> 00:39:54.896 A:middle
When the New York Times reader
transitions from the Watch

00:39:54.896 --> 00:39:57.256 A:middle
to their iPhone, they may notice

00:39:57.256 --> 00:40:00.106 A:middle
on their lock screen the
New York Times app icon.



00:39:57.256 --> 00:40:00.106 A:middle
on their lock screen the
New York Times app icon.

00:40:00.936 --> 00:40:03.616 A:middle
Swiping that up will take
them directly to the story

00:40:03.616 --> 00:40:05.716 A:middle
that they are reading
on the AppleWatch.

00:40:06.956 --> 00:40:10.436 A:middle
Hand off makes it easy for
the New York Times reader

00:40:10.686 --> 00:40:13.676 A:middle
to move seamlessly from
their Watch to their iPhone

00:40:13.676 --> 00:40:14.696 A:middle
when they want to know more.

00:40:15.556 --> 00:40:18.136 A:middle
This benefits the New York
Times reader, of course,

00:40:18.676 --> 00:40:20.716 A:middle
but also benefits
the New York Times

00:40:20.716 --> 00:40:23.886 A:middle
because it keeps people
engaged with their experience,

00:40:23.886 --> 00:40:26.366 A:middle
their apps for a
longer period of time.

00:40:27.366 --> 00:40:29.706 A:middle
Hand-off is relatively new.

00:40:30.246 --> 00:40:33.406 A:middle
You may feel the need to
educate your users about it.

00:40:33.406 --> 00:40:36.016 A:middle
As a matter of fact, the
New York Times does this.

00:40:36.636 --> 00:40:39.746 A:middle
In the first launch onboarding
experience they show a tip

00:40:39.746 --> 00:40:41.146 A:middle
about how it works.

00:40:41.826 --> 00:40:45.206 A:middle
Otherwise, they just rely upon
people naturally discovering

00:40:45.206 --> 00:40:47.946 A:middle
this function on their own.

00:40:47.946 --> 00:40:50.066 A:middle
Now, other apps take
a different approach.

00:40:50.546 --> 00:40:50.826 A:middle
This is CNN.

00:40:50.826 --> 00:40:53.346 A:middle
Soon they will be
taking advantage

00:40:53.346 --> 00:40:55.696 A:middle
of the video play back
capabilities of the Apple Watch

00:40:56.136 --> 00:40:59.926 A:middle
to provide short video
clips from their content.



00:41:00.626 --> 00:41:03.506 A:middle
Now, they are going to
also provide a little bit

00:41:03.506 --> 00:41:06.216 A:middle
of instruction that
says people can continue

00:41:06.216 --> 00:41:08.526 A:middle
to watch the full
video on their iPhone.

00:41:09.246 --> 00:41:11.336 A:middle
That is really good
information to have

00:41:11.406 --> 00:41:13.136 A:middle
because without it
you wouldn't know

00:41:13.436 --> 00:41:15.276 A:middle
that there's a longer
version of the video.

00:41:15.826 --> 00:41:17.236 A:middle
This is useful information.

00:41:18.426 --> 00:41:21.606 A:middle
CNN also shows this little
monochromatic version

00:41:21.606 --> 00:41:24.546 A:middle
of their iOS icon which
is a pretty clever trick

00:41:24.546 --> 00:41:26.466 A:middle
for priming people to spot it

00:41:26.466 --> 00:41:29.946 A:middle
when they go over
to their iPhone.

00:41:30.046 --> 00:41:33.756 A:middle
Both CNN and the New York
Times provide good examples

00:41:34.106 --> 00:41:36.696 A:middle
of how you can communicate that
your app supports hand off.

00:41:37.486 --> 00:41:41.856 A:middle
However, over time this may
become less necessary as more

00:41:41.856 --> 00:41:43.956 A:middle
and more people will
expect that all

00:41:43.956 --> 00:41:46.016 A:middle
of your apps will
support hand-off.

00:41:46.696 --> 00:41:49.596 A:middle
It's up to you to decide
what's right for your app.

00:41:49.786 --> 00:41:52.386 A:middle
If you are concerned that people
won't realize there's more

00:41:52.386 --> 00:41:55.176 A:middle
information or functionality
which is available

00:41:55.176 --> 00:41:58.226 A:middle
on your iPhone app, by
all means, let them know.

00:41:58.356 --> 00:42:00.406 A:middle
That's helpful to your users.



00:41:58.356 --> 00:42:00.406 A:middle
That's helpful to your users.

00:42:00.886 --> 00:42:04.186 A:middle
Otherwise, just let people
discover it on their own.

00:42:05.176 --> 00:42:06.596 A:middle
Now, that said, there's
one thing

00:42:06.596 --> 00:42:09.616 A:middle
which is almost never required
when it comes to hand-off.

00:42:10.196 --> 00:42:12.076 A:middle
That is showing a
butt-in for hand-off.

00:42:12.806 --> 00:42:16.696 A:middle
Only in rare circumstances is
it ever necessary for people

00:42:16.696 --> 00:42:18.046 A:middle
to tap a button in order

00:42:18.046 --> 00:42:20.036 A:middle
to continue an activity
on their iPhone.

00:42:20.476 --> 00:42:22.656 A:middle
Hand-off should happen
automatically.

00:42:23.976 --> 00:42:26.456 A:middle
Now, there's one more aspect
of lightweight interaction

00:42:26.726 --> 00:42:28.126 A:middle
that I would like
to discuss with you.

00:42:28.776 --> 00:42:32.746 A:middle
It relates to health
apps and relates to --

00:42:32.976 --> 00:42:35.366 A:middle
when you are using
HealthKit to track a work out.

00:42:36.876 --> 00:42:39.816 A:middle
More specifically it's
about creating sessions

00:42:39.816 --> 00:42:41.226 A:middle
to keep your app
in the foreground

00:42:41.656 --> 00:42:44.326 A:middle
when you are tracking an
activity like going for a run.

00:42:45.306 --> 00:42:47.886 A:middle
Ordinarily when Apple
Watch has been sleeping

00:42:47.956 --> 00:42:52.326 A:middle
for ar short period of time, it
assumes that the user is done

00:42:52.326 --> 00:42:54.466 A:middle
with doing whatever
they were doing before,

00:42:54.956 --> 00:42:57.436 A:middle
no longer interested in
the app, and it will resume

00:42:57.506 --> 00:43:00.236 A:middle
to the clock face, not
the previously used app.



00:42:57.506 --> 00:43:00.236 A:middle
to the clock face, not
the previously used app.

00:43:01.276 --> 00:43:03.256 A:middle
But this changes when
an app is being used

00:43:03.256 --> 00:43:05.656 A:middle
to track an activity
like going for a run.

00:43:06.846 --> 00:43:09.396 A:middle
While that person is
running, they want to stay

00:43:09.396 --> 00:43:10.766 A:middle
in the activity tracker app,

00:43:11.406 --> 00:43:13.426 A:middle
raising the wrist
should allow them

00:43:13.426 --> 00:43:16.576 A:middle
to quickly check their
progress, which is why

00:43:16.576 --> 00:43:20.656 A:middle
in WatchOS 2 activity
tracker apps will remain

00:43:20.656 --> 00:43:23.016 A:middle
in the foreground while the
HealthKit workout session

00:43:23.016 --> 00:43:23.626 A:middle
is ongoing.

00:43:24.476 --> 00:43:28.496 A:middle
Implemented correctly, sessions
enable lightweight interaction

00:43:28.496 --> 00:43:30.266 A:middle
because simply by
raising your wrist,

00:43:30.736 --> 00:43:33.996 A:middle
you return to the app
you're most interested in.

00:43:33.996 --> 00:43:36.256 A:middle
People don't need to
continually navigate back

00:43:36.256 --> 00:43:37.586 A:middle
to the app from the home screen.

00:43:38.446 --> 00:43:40.856 A:middle
If you intend to
adopt this feature,

00:43:40.856 --> 00:43:43.896 A:middle
there are a few key
things you should consider

00:43:43.896 --> 00:43:44.666 A:middle
and keep in mind.

00:43:45.366 --> 00:43:49.396 A:middle
First and foremost, the person
using your app must always be

00:43:49.396 --> 00:43:50.056 A:middle
in control.

00:43:51.516 --> 00:43:54.916 A:middle
They must deliberately and
knowingly start a workout.

00:43:55.616 --> 00:43:58.666 A:middle
They must always understand
how to end a workout.

00:43:58.756 --> 00:44:02.086 A:middle
And when they look at the
app, it is a really good idea



00:43:58.756 --> 00:44:02.086 A:middle
And when they look at the
app, it is a really good idea

00:44:02.086 --> 00:44:04.276 A:middle
that they understand that
a session is ongoing.

00:44:04.936 --> 00:44:07.536 A:middle
Your app's UI should
be obviously different.

00:44:07.996 --> 00:44:09.296 A:middle
It should be clear to
people that they are

00:44:09.296 --> 00:44:10.916 A:middle
in a special modal state.

00:44:11.656 --> 00:44:14.886 A:middle
The Fitness app provides a good
example for you to reference.

00:44:15.716 --> 00:44:17.646 A:middle
To start a workout
in the Fitness app,

00:44:17.646 --> 00:44:19.066 A:middle
the user taps the start button.

00:44:19.466 --> 00:44:21.556 A:middle
The button literally says start.

00:44:21.776 --> 00:44:22.336 A:middle
It's clear.

00:44:22.816 --> 00:44:25.556 A:middle
After tapping the start button,
there's a three-second count

00:44:25.556 --> 00:44:27.626 A:middle
down that a session
is about to begin.

00:44:28.586 --> 00:44:31.106 A:middle
Ending a work out is
equally straight forward.

00:44:31.386 --> 00:44:32.856 A:middle
You just swipe to the first page

00:44:32.856 --> 00:44:34.656 A:middle
and tap the clearly
marked end button.

00:44:35.166 --> 00:44:38.576 A:middle
This is a consequence.

00:44:38.666 --> 00:44:40.646 A:middle
This is why I don't
set high expectations

00:44:40.646 --> 00:44:41.906 A:middle
for myself when I go for a run.

00:44:42.456 --> 00:44:47.686 A:middle
As a convenience, there's a
second end button in the menu,

00:44:48.186 --> 00:44:50.566 A:middle
but it's a good idea to not
rely upon people knowing

00:44:50.566 --> 00:44:54.026 A:middle
that your app has a menu in
order for them to end a session.

00:44:55.406 --> 00:44:56.956 A:middle
While the workout is ongoing,

00:44:57.066 --> 00:44:59.756 A:middle
the Fitness app UI is
clearly in a different state.

00:44:59.756 --> 00:45:02.546 A:middle
It is obvious, the
UI makes it obvious



00:44:59.756 --> 00:45:02.546 A:middle
It is obvious, the
UI makes it obvious

00:45:02.546 --> 00:45:03.846 A:middle
that it is recording a work out.

00:45:04.866 --> 00:45:07.456 A:middle
Sessions are about convenience.

00:45:07.506 --> 00:45:09.116 A:middle
They are not about
keeping people

00:45:09.116 --> 00:45:10.546 A:middle
in your app against their will.

00:45:11.226 --> 00:45:14.856 A:middle
If the session started
without the user's knowledge

00:45:14.856 --> 00:45:16.856 A:middle
or it's difficult for them
to figure out how to end it

00:45:17.166 --> 00:45:18.936 A:middle
or it is not clear
that one is ongoing,

00:45:18.986 --> 00:45:21.566 A:middle
they will likely feel
stuck in your app

00:45:21.566 --> 00:45:23.526 A:middle
and that is not a
great experience.

00:45:24.826 --> 00:45:28.016 A:middle
So let's take stock.

00:45:28.186 --> 00:45:30.536 A:middle
I think that was a lot of stuff.

00:45:30.536 --> 00:45:31.196 A:middle
I want to review.

00:45:31.966 --> 00:45:35.036 A:middle
Personal communication is
about applying what we know

00:45:35.036 --> 00:45:38.366 A:middle
about thoughtful and effective
interpersonal communication

00:45:38.706 --> 00:45:40.476 A:middle
to the design of your apps.

00:45:40.896 --> 00:45:43.986 A:middle
It is about being respectful
of people's time and attention

00:45:44.356 --> 00:45:46.906 A:middle
by being concise,
relevant and responsive

00:45:46.976 --> 00:45:49.916 A:middle
to the person's individual
preferences.

00:45:50.696 --> 00:45:52.906 A:middle
Holistic Design is about
blurring the boundaries

00:45:52.906 --> 00:45:54.746 A:middle
between software and hardware

00:45:55.096 --> 00:45:57.946 A:middle
by making your app's UI
practically indistinguishable

00:45:58.306 --> 00:45:59.276 A:middle
from the Watch bezel.



00:46:00.086 --> 00:46:03.356 A:middle
Utilizing the Force Touch
display to enable quick access

00:46:03.786 --> 00:46:06.156 A:middle
for contextual actions
or preferences.

00:46:07.076 --> 00:46:09.836 A:middle
Knowing that scrolling is
easy so there's no need

00:46:09.896 --> 00:46:13.536 A:middle
for cramped UIs, and using
the new Picker to enable quick

00:46:13.536 --> 00:46:16.316 A:middle
and accurate selections
in context.

00:46:16.896 --> 00:46:19.786 A:middle
And using haptic feedback
to create sophisticated

00:46:19.786 --> 00:46:24.206 A:middle
and more deeply life like
experiences in your app.

00:46:24.206 --> 00:46:27.436 A:middle
And lightweight interaction
is about offering people quick

00:46:27.436 --> 00:46:30.936 A:middle
and convenient access to
information and actions.

00:46:32.026 --> 00:46:35.116 A:middle
Now, these three themes
should be the foundation upon

00:46:35.116 --> 00:46:38.246 A:middle
which you design
your Apple Watch app.

00:46:41.056 --> 00:46:42.356 A:middle
But there's something
missing here.

00:46:42.356 --> 00:46:45.426 A:middle
There is something that
these three themes don't

00:46:45.586 --> 00:46:46.536 A:middle
adequately capture.

00:46:47.536 --> 00:46:49.806 A:middle
That is the role of
beauty and delight.

00:46:51.166 --> 00:46:55.306 A:middle
Apps that are beautiful and
delight us make our experience

00:46:55.306 --> 00:46:57.256 A:middle
with technology more
interesting,

00:46:57.776 --> 00:47:00.066 A:middle
more welcoming and more fun.



00:46:57.776 --> 00:47:00.066 A:middle
more welcoming and more fun.

00:47:01.176 --> 00:47:03.586 A:middle
Even though the Apple
Watch display is small,

00:47:03.666 --> 00:47:06.596 A:middle
there is still plenty of
space to make it beautiful.

00:47:07.456 --> 00:47:09.596 A:middle
Even though interaction
times are meant to be brief,

00:47:09.596 --> 00:47:11.796 A:middle
there's still plenty
of time to delight.

00:47:12.576 --> 00:47:16.076 A:middle
I would like to share with
you three of my favorite apps

00:47:16.516 --> 00:47:19.096 A:middle
that are really exemplars
of this concept.

00:47:20.516 --> 00:47:23.136 A:middle
Resound makes Bluetooth
enabled hearing aids

00:47:23.606 --> 00:47:25.616 A:middle
that could be controlled
by your Apple Watch.

00:47:26.376 --> 00:47:28.626 A:middle
This is a natural
fit for Apple Watch

00:47:28.666 --> 00:47:32.176 A:middle
because it is now really
convenient to discretely check

00:47:32.176 --> 00:47:34.596 A:middle
and adjust the settings
of your hearing aid.

00:47:35.306 --> 00:47:39.506 A:middle
There are various preset options
that you can choose from.

00:47:39.766 --> 00:47:42.646 A:middle
You can modify those with
fine grained controls

00:47:42.646 --> 00:47:46.046 A:middle
for noise reduction,
speech attenuation

00:47:46.366 --> 00:47:47.716 A:middle
and wind cancellation.

00:47:48.586 --> 00:47:51.706 A:middle
Now each of these settings
is beautifully expressed

00:47:51.856 --> 00:47:52.746 A:middle
with animation.

00:47:53.616 --> 00:47:55.376 A:middle
They could have just
used sliders, right?

00:47:56.136 --> 00:47:59.246 A:middle
But these animations are
gorgeous, and they do way more

00:47:59.246 --> 00:48:02.286 A:middle
to help people understand
what each setting does



00:47:59.246 --> 00:48:02.286 A:middle
to help people understand
what each setting does

00:48:02.506 --> 00:48:05.126 A:middle
and what the current value is.

00:48:05.816 --> 00:48:08.606 A:middle
Now, Pace Maker is
an awesome DJ app

00:48:08.906 --> 00:48:10.516 A:middle
that just won an
Apple design award,

00:48:11.046 --> 00:48:14.036 A:middle
and one of the reasons
why we awarded them is

00:48:14.036 --> 00:48:17.126 A:middle
because of their excellent
Apple Watch design concept.

00:48:17.996 --> 00:48:20.986 A:middle
Pace Maker turns your
watch into a remote.

00:48:20.986 --> 00:48:25.836 A:middle
It allows you to mix and pick
tracks when your iPhone is not

00:48:25.836 --> 00:48:27.686 A:middle
on you and docked
with your speaker.

00:48:28.986 --> 00:48:32.196 A:middle
Now, one thing that is really
cool is you can apply effects

00:48:32.636 --> 00:48:33.806 A:middle
while a song is playing.

00:48:34.616 --> 00:48:36.756 A:middle
In a second I'll
show you what happens

00:48:36.756 --> 00:48:38.146 A:middle
when you apply an effect.

00:48:38.146 --> 00:48:42.356 A:middle
I would like you to pay
attention to these animations

00:48:42.356 --> 00:48:44.146 A:middle
that they made for
these buttons.

00:48:45.516 --> 00:49:18.616 A:middle
[Music]



00:48:45.516 --> 00:49:18.616 A:middle
[Music]

00:49:19.116 --> 00:49:19.926 A:middle
One more time.

00:49:20.516 --> 00:49:26.986 A:middle
[Electronic music]

00:49:27.486 --> 00:49:29.056 A:middle
How cool is that?

00:49:29.476 --> 00:49:29.826 A:middle
Right?

00:49:30.016 --> 00:49:31.296 A:middle
[Applause]

00:49:31.296 --> 00:49:32.736 A:middle
Yeah, give it up for Pace Maker.

00:49:32.736 --> 00:49:35.566 A:middle
It is amazing.

00:49:37.176 --> 00:49:39.336 A:middle
Now, they could have just
highlighted those buttons

00:49:39.376 --> 00:49:41.436 A:middle
or drawn an outline around
them when they were active,

00:49:41.516 --> 00:49:43.216 A:middle
but they didn't do that.

00:49:43.716 --> 00:49:46.136 A:middle
They changed the
size, the shape.

00:49:47.086 --> 00:49:49.116 A:middle
They had them sync
up with the music.

00:49:49.776 --> 00:49:51.326 A:middle
I mean it's super creative.

00:49:51.896 --> 00:49:54.596 A:middle
It's meaningful, and it is
synched up to the music.

00:49:55.336 --> 00:49:55.956 A:middle
Really cool.

00:49:56.946 --> 00:49:58.416 A:middle
And finally, this is Toby.

00:49:59.276 --> 00:50:01.146 A:middle
Now, in Apple Watch
you can feed Toby.



00:49:59.276 --> 00:50:01.146 A:middle
Now, in Apple Watch
you can feed Toby.

00:50:01.706 --> 00:50:05.616 A:middle
When he's bored you
can play with Toby.

00:50:06.166 --> 00:50:12.006 A:middle
When he's tired you can
ask Toby to take a nap.

00:50:14.056 --> 00:50:15.776 A:middle
Good night, little guy.

00:50:15.816 --> 00:50:19.316 A:middle
You can even take Toby
for a walk when he needs

00:50:19.316 --> 00:50:21.766 A:middle
to go to the bathroom.

00:50:21.766 --> 00:50:24.836 A:middle
Each of these animations
is adorable.

00:50:24.866 --> 00:50:27.446 A:middle
They are these great
little moments.

00:50:27.776 --> 00:50:30.366 A:middle
Look at the way he's peeking
off from the side of the watch.

00:50:31.466 --> 00:50:32.566 A:middle
So engaging.

00:50:32.796 --> 00:50:33.926 A:middle
It's so charming.

00:50:34.606 --> 00:50:37.046 A:middle
But check this out.

00:50:37.046 --> 00:50:40.926 A:middle
Now, Toby can't be
on both your iPhone

00:50:41.346 --> 00:50:42.696 A:middle
and the Watch at the same time.

00:50:42.696 --> 00:50:45.166 A:middle
It is not physically
possible for a dog to be

00:50:45.166 --> 00:50:48.036 A:middle
in both places at once.

00:50:48.036 --> 00:50:53.426 A:middle
So in order to call Toby over to
your Watch you just Force Touch

00:50:53.456 --> 00:50:58.176 A:middle
press the display, use the
action, say, "Here, Toby."

00:50:58.676 --> 00:51:03.696 A:middle
Isn't that amazing?



00:50:58.676 --> 00:51:03.696 A:middle
Isn't that amazing?

00:51:08.446 --> 00:51:09.236 A:middle
I just love that.

00:51:10.596 --> 00:51:11.576 A:middle
So creative.

00:51:12.846 --> 00:51:14.166 A:middle
These apps demonstrate

00:51:14.166 --> 00:51:18.286 A:middle
that creative ideas thoughtfully
executed with great attention

00:51:18.316 --> 00:51:22.006 A:middle
to detail result in some
really fantastic experiences

00:51:22.006 --> 00:51:22.886 A:middle
for Apple Watch.

00:51:23.616 --> 00:51:26.336 A:middle
All three look fantastic
and do things

00:51:26.336 --> 00:51:28.576 A:middle
that are original
and unexpected.

00:51:29.476 --> 00:51:31.816 A:middle
And all three use
animation to great effect.

00:51:32.866 --> 00:51:35.316 A:middle
Which brings me to the last
thing I want to talk with you

00:51:35.776 --> 00:51:38.796 A:middle
about -- talk to you about
today and that is animation.

00:51:39.516 --> 00:51:42.716 A:middle
In watchOS 2 making great
animations just got a

00:51:42.716 --> 00:51:43.606 A:middle
lot easier.

00:51:44.126 --> 00:51:47.276 A:middle
Basic layout and appearance
properties are now animatable

00:51:47.276 --> 00:51:47.776 A:middle
at runtime.

00:51:48.696 --> 00:51:50.006 A:middle
You can animate properties,

00:51:50.046 --> 00:51:53.306 A:middle
like it controls its
height or its width.

00:51:54.566 --> 00:51:55.896 A:middle
You can adjust insets.

00:51:56.416 --> 00:51:59.126 A:middle
You can change alignments.



00:52:00.976 --> 00:52:02.366 A:middle
Background colors.

00:52:03.696 --> 00:52:04.526 A:middle
Tint colors.

00:52:05.096 --> 00:52:07.966 A:middle
And of course opacity.

00:52:09.306 --> 00:52:12.786 A:middle
Now, all of these
animations have easing applied

00:52:13.226 --> 00:52:16.366 A:middle
so the transitions between
different states are smooth

00:52:16.366 --> 00:52:17.066 A:middle
and natural.

00:52:18.046 --> 00:52:21.226 A:middle
By combining animations you
can do some pretty cool things.

00:52:21.826 --> 00:52:24.166 A:middle
For instance, you can
create animated bar charts

00:52:24.966 --> 00:52:27.626 A:middle
or smoothly animate
between different data sets.

00:52:28.646 --> 00:52:32.006 A:middle
You can recreate the number
animation from the activity app.

00:52:32.996 --> 00:52:35.656 A:middle
Or better yet, you
can combine this

00:52:35.656 --> 00:52:37.246 A:middle
with an image sequence
animation.

00:52:38.716 --> 00:52:40.666 A:middle
There are really
countless possibilities

00:52:41.036 --> 00:52:42.186 A:middle
for you to explore.

00:52:43.516 --> 00:52:47.076 A:middle
But as with haptics,
exercise restraint.

00:52:47.816 --> 00:52:50.986 A:middle
Animations on Apple Watch
should, of course, be quick.

00:52:51.596 --> 00:52:53.876 A:middle
They should never feel like they
are slowing you down or getting

00:52:53.876 --> 00:52:56.316 A:middle
in your way especially
on your Watch.

00:52:56.986 --> 00:52:58.536 A:middle
They should be these
little moments

00:52:58.576 --> 00:53:01.606 A:middle
that make your app more
informative and delightful.



00:52:58.576 --> 00:53:01.606 A:middle
that make your app more
informative and delightful.

00:53:02.646 --> 00:53:05.336 A:middle
Okay. So that's about
all the time I have.

00:53:05.776 --> 00:53:09.006 A:middle
For more information, these are
really great sessions I want you

00:53:09.006 --> 00:53:09.626 A:middle
to know about.

00:53:10.396 --> 00:53:12.816 A:middle
If you're an engineer, you
definitely want to check

00:53:12.816 --> 00:53:14.616 A:middle
out WatchKIt tips and tricks,

00:53:14.956 --> 00:53:16.536 A:middle
happens this Friday
in this room.

00:53:17.196 --> 00:53:19.006 A:middle
If you want to know
more about animation,

00:53:19.006 --> 00:53:20.356 A:middle
we have a whole session devoted

00:53:20.396 --> 00:53:22.876 A:middle
to the topic called
Designing with Animation.

00:53:23.816 --> 00:53:27.216 A:middle
Next, as in not next because
it was a couple hours ago,

00:53:27.216 --> 00:53:29.736 A:middle
but we had a great
presentation called Designing

00:53:29.736 --> 00:53:30.526 A:middle
for Future Hardware.

00:53:30.526 --> 00:53:33.466 A:middle
That's a fascinating look at
how you design for a device

00:53:33.466 --> 00:53:34.796 A:middle
that doesn't yet exist.

00:53:35.446 --> 00:53:37.326 A:middle
The video will be online
shortly, of course.

00:53:38.126 --> 00:53:42.086 A:middle
If you're into typography like
I am, you really do not want

00:53:42.086 --> 00:53:46.346 A:middle
to miss this session which
happens Friday here in Presidio.

00:53:46.346 --> 00:53:49.476 A:middle
It is one of the people
that designed San Francisco,

00:53:49.476 --> 00:53:51.666 A:middle
the new system font for
all of our platforms.

00:53:51.966 --> 00:53:55.356 A:middle
He goes into great detail about
the design of the typeface.

00:53:56.286 --> 00:53:59.556 A:middle
Finally, if you are not sick
of hearing my voice already,

00:53:59.556 --> 00:54:02.856 A:middle
we are going to be doing a
second entirely different talk



00:53:59.556 --> 00:54:02.856 A:middle
we are going to be doing a
second entirely different talk

00:54:02.856 --> 00:54:05.806 A:middle
about designing for Apple
Watch that happens just

00:54:05.806 --> 00:54:07.836 A:middle
after the type session.

00:54:08.906 --> 00:54:10.846 A:middle
And in the meantime I
encourage you to check

00:54:10.846 --> 00:54:13.326 A:middle
out the recently
redesigned Apple Watch human

00:54:13.326 --> 00:54:14.356 A:middle
interface guidelines.

00:54:14.956 --> 00:54:16.716 A:middle
It contains a lot
of information,

00:54:17.106 --> 00:54:19.106 A:middle
downloadable templates
and guidelines

00:54:19.106 --> 00:54:21.466 A:middle
that will help you jump
start the design process

00:54:21.796 --> 00:54:22.636 A:middle
for Apple Watch.

00:54:23.206 --> 00:54:26.426 A:middle
For further questions or to show
me the awesome apps you made

00:54:26.426 --> 00:54:29.296 A:middle
for Apple Watch or
any other platform,

00:54:29.596 --> 00:54:31.036 A:middle
feel free to shoot me an e-mail.

00:54:31.306 --> 00:54:32.566 A:middle
Thank you so much for your time.

00:54:32.566 --> 00:54:32.976 A:middle
It has been an honor.

00:54:33.508 --> 00:54:35.508 A:middle
[Applause]
