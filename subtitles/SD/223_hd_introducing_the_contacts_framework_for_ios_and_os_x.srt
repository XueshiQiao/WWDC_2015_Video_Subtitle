&gt;&gt; BRUCE STADNYK:
Good afternoon!

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:38.516 A:middle
I am Bruce Stadnyk from the iOS
contacts team and I'm excited

00:00:38.516 --> 00:00:41.646 A:middle
to introduce the new
Contacts Framework to you.

[ Applause ]

00:00:46.396 --> 00:00:47.276 A:middle
&gt;&gt; BRUCE STADNYK: If you are new

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:50.196 A:middle
to Apple's platforms you
will learn how easy it is

00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:52.266 A:middle
to use contacts in your app.

00:00:52.896 --> 00:00:54.876 A:middle
If you are an experienced
developer with Address Book,

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.546 A:middle
you will love this
new Framework.

00:00:59.756 --> 00:01:02.716 A:middle
So what is this new
Contacts Framework?



00:00:59.756 --> 00:01:02.716 A:middle
So what is this new
Contacts Framework?

00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:06.696 A:middle
Well, we have been listening
to your Address Book feedback

00:01:06.696 --> 00:01:09.546 A:middle
and today we are addressing
the most frequent request.

00:01:09.776 --> 00:01:13.946 A:middle
The Address Book Framework
provides an Objective-C API

00:01:13.946 --> 00:01:18.556 A:middle
to access contacts,
and the API is designed

00:01:18.556 --> 00:01:19.676 A:middle
to work well with Swift

00:01:20.516 --> 00:01:22.926 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:01:23.426 --> 00:01:25.336 A:middle
&gt;&gt; BRUCE STADNYK: We are as
excited about this as you are.

00:01:27.356 --> 00:01:30.306 A:middle
There are many design goals with
this new Contacts Framework.

00:01:30.796 --> 00:01:35.116 A:middle
I'm going to review a few of
the key ones with you now.

00:01:35.346 --> 00:01:38.316 A:middle
One, to address the
majority of apps

00:01:38.746 --> 00:01:42.716 A:middle
that are mostly get contacts
and do not modify contacts,

00:01:43.496 --> 00:01:46.926 A:middle
we have designed the API for
thread safe read-only usage.

00:01:48.656 --> 00:01:51.756 A:middle
This is done mostly with
immutable value objects

00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:53.476 A:middle
that do not reference
a data store.

00:01:55.476 --> 00:01:59.376 A:middle
This allows you to pass
contacts easily between queues

00:01:59.376 --> 00:02:05.036 A:middle
on your app and not have
unexpected I/O occur on them.



00:01:59.376 --> 00:02:05.036 A:middle
on your app and not have
unexpected I/O occur on them.

00:02:05.246 --> 00:02:07.966 A:middle
Another is to have
the same contacts API

00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:11.616 A:middle
on OS X, iOS and watchOS.

00:02:12.516 --> 00:02:15.026 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:02:15.526 --> 00:02:18.486 A:middle
&gt;&gt; BRUCE STADNYK: You learn one
API and then use the same code

00:02:18.486 --> 00:02:21.186 A:middle
to access contacts across
multiple Apple platforms.

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:26.386 A:middle
And, Address Book,
if you are using it,

00:02:26.856 --> 00:02:27.976 A:middle
it is being deprecated.

00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:35.676 A:middle
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:39.106 A:middle
&gt;&gt; BRUCE STADNYK: We don't
realize how much we take

00:02:39.106 --> 00:02:41.186 A:middle
for granted the contacts
on our devices.

00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:44.696 A:middle
For example when we
receive a phone call

00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:48.336 A:middle
and we only see a phone number,
we ask ourselves: Who is that?

00:02:49.396 --> 00:02:50.996 A:middle
Is it someone from our family?

00:02:51.776 --> 00:02:52.556 A:middle
Is it a friend?

00:02:53.326 --> 00:02:54.436 A:middle
Another telemarketer?

00:02:56.136 --> 00:02:58.936 A:middle
It is a much better experience
when a contact is displayed.

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:02.396 A:middle
Oh, it's John Apleseed,
one of my best friends.



00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:02.396 A:middle
Oh, it's John Apleseed,
one of my best friends.

00:03:05.076 --> 00:03:07.836 A:middle
So everyone has contacts
on their devices.

00:03:08.616 --> 00:03:11.236 A:middle
They help us to identify who
we are communicating with

00:03:11.836 --> 00:03:14.816 A:middle
and also help us to make
phone calls, send e-mails,

00:03:15.126 --> 00:03:17.046 A:middle
and initiate other
means of communication.

00:03:17.706 --> 00:03:21.836 A:middle
For example, I can speak
to my device and say: Hey,

00:03:21.836 --> 00:03:23.946 A:middle
Siri, call John Appleseed.

00:03:24.696 --> 00:03:26.206 A:middle
Okay. There we go.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; SIRI: Calling John
Appleseed, iPhone on speaker.

00:03:29.716 --> 00:03:32.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; BRUCE STADNYK: So
contacts are a central part

00:03:32.206 --> 00:03:33.976 A:middle
of the user experience
on our devices.

00:03:37.726 --> 00:03:40.566 A:middle
So how does the Contacts
Framework handle this

00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:41.566 A:middle
contact information?

00:03:42.566 --> 00:03:44.886 A:middle
Let's take a look at an
example with John Appleseed.

00:03:46.186 --> 00:03:47.726 A:middle
For those of you
experienced with Address Book,

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:48.896 A:middle
this is a quick review.

00:03:51.156 --> 00:03:54.996 A:middle
Here we have John's profile
picture, his first name,

00:03:56.146 --> 00:04:05.286 A:middle
last name, his home e-mail
address, work e-mail address,



00:03:56.146 --> 00:04:05.286 A:middle
last name, his home e-mail
address, work e-mail address,

00:04:06.276 --> 00:04:07.786 A:middle
and the phone number
for his iPhone.

00:04:11.636 --> 00:04:14.546 A:middle
These contact properties
represent this

00:04:14.576 --> 00:04:15.536 A:middle
contact information.

00:04:16.995 --> 00:04:19.416 A:middle
The profile image is
represented by image data.

00:04:21.086 --> 00:04:22.976 A:middle
The name is broken
into components.

00:04:23.516 --> 00:04:25.646 A:middle
So the first name is
represented by given name

00:04:25.646 --> 00:04:29.626 A:middle
and the last name
by family name.

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:32.776 A:middle
Both the home and work e-mail
addresses are represented

00:04:32.776 --> 00:04:33.736 A:middle
by e-mail addresses.

00:04:34.316 --> 00:04:38.886 A:middle
And the phone number is
represented by phone numbers.

00:04:40.736 --> 00:04:42.866 A:middle
There are many more
contact properties.

00:04:43.186 --> 00:04:45.756 A:middle
You can refer to the contacts
documentation for more details.

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:50.546 A:middle
Now, let's talk more
about this object.

00:04:52.976 --> 00:04:55.066 A:middle
This is the CNContact object.

00:04:56.776 --> 00:05:00.906 A:middle
It is an immutable value
object of contact properties.



00:04:56.776 --> 00:05:00.906 A:middle
It is an immutable value
object of contact properties.

00:05:02.126 --> 00:05:04.196 A:middle
It is modeled like NSDictionary.

00:05:05.176 --> 00:05:08.736 A:middle
It has a mutable
subclass, CNMuteableContact,

00:05:09.236 --> 00:05:11.186 A:middle
that you modify the
contact properties with.

00:05:12.616 --> 00:05:13.996 A:middle
You will see this
pattern throughout the

00:05:13.996 --> 00:05:14.906 A:middle
Contacts Framework.

00:05:18.556 --> 00:05:21.516 A:middle
For contact properties that
can have multiple values

00:05:21.876 --> 00:05:23.856 A:middle
like e-mail addresses,
or phone numbers,

00:05:24.606 --> 00:05:27.446 A:middle
an array of CNLabeledValue
is used.

00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:33.976 A:middle
CNLabeledValue is an immutable
Tuple of label and value,

00:05:35.256 --> 00:05:38.276 A:middle
where the label is a string,
and the value is an object.

00:05:38.726 --> 00:05:40.416 A:middle
Like string for an
e-mail address.

00:05:42.596 --> 00:05:45.906 A:middle
The value can be labeled
to help differentiate it

00:05:46.106 --> 00:05:47.806 A:middle
from the multiple
values for a property,

00:05:48.916 --> 00:05:52.116 A:middle
such as a home e-mail address,
or a work e-mail address.

00:05:53.096 --> 00:05:57.266 A:middle
For those of you
experienced with Address Book,

00:05:58.036 --> 00:06:02.496 A:middle
AB multivalue is replaced by
this array of CNLabeledValue.



00:05:58.036 --> 00:06:02.496 A:middle
AB multivalue is replaced by
this array of CNLabeledValue.

00:06:03.526 --> 00:06:06.306 A:middle
Yes, you heard that correctly,
AB multivalue is dead.

[ Applause ]

00:06:12.046 --> 00:06:12.936 A:middle
&gt;&gt; BRUCE STADNYK: Now I
would like to take a look

00:06:12.936 --> 00:06:15.656 A:middle
at an example of creating a new
contact with John Appleseed.

00:06:16.606 --> 00:06:18.146 A:middle
So first we import Contacts,

00:06:19.576 --> 00:06:21.596 A:middle
then we create a
mutable contact,

00:06:21.596 --> 00:06:25.136 A:middle
as we are going to
be adding to it.

00:06:25.386 --> 00:06:30.036 A:middle
We then set John's profile
picture as NSData to imageData,

00:06:30.836 --> 00:06:35.116 A:middle
and then we set his name to
givenName and familyName.

00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:41.106 A:middle
Now, for John's two
e-mail addresses,

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:45.816 A:middle
we create two CNLabeled
values, one with CNLabelHome,

00:06:46.336 --> 00:06:47.816 A:middle
the other with CNLabelWork.

00:06:48.816 --> 00:06:50.606 A:middle
These are some of
the predefined labels

00:06:50.606 --> 00:06:51.766 A:middle
in the Contacts Framework.

00:06:53.356 --> 00:06:55.576 A:middle
These predefined labels
have localized strings

00:06:55.576 --> 00:06:57.316 A:middle
that you can use
in your apps UI.

00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:00.536 A:middle
You can also create
your own custom labels.



00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:00.536 A:middle
You can also create
your own custom labels.

00:07:01.096 --> 00:07:05.766 A:middle
We take these two label values,
home e-mail and work e-mail,

00:07:06.236 --> 00:07:09.156 A:middle
place them in an array, and
set them on e-mail addresses.

00:07:09.776 --> 00:07:10.566 A:middle
It's that simple.

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:15.496 A:middle
And we can do the same thing
with John's phone number.

00:07:16.056 --> 00:07:17.676 A:middle
Again, we create
a CNLabeled value,

00:07:18.506 --> 00:07:23.526 A:middle
use the iPhone predefined label,
create a CNPhoneNumber object

00:07:23.676 --> 00:07:27.376 A:middle
as the value, place the
label value in array,

00:07:27.636 --> 00:07:28.896 A:middle
and set that to phone numbers.

00:07:32.636 --> 00:07:35.536 A:middle
I also know John's home address,
so I can add that as well.

00:07:35.536 --> 00:07:39.256 A:middle
I create a
CNMuteablePostalAddress,

00:07:39.866 --> 00:07:42.306 A:middle
set the appropriate information,

00:07:43.506 --> 00:07:46.056 A:middle
again create a labeled
value using LabelHome,

00:07:46.726 --> 00:07:49.376 A:middle
place that in array, and set
that to postal addresses.

00:07:53.296 --> 00:07:55.356 A:middle
Finally, I also know
his birthday,

00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:58.696 A:middle
so I can create an
NSDateComponent, set the day,

00:07:58.696 --> 00:07:59.816 A:middle
month, and year component,



00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:01.886 A:middle
and set that to the
birthday property.

00:08:03.156 --> 00:08:05.996 A:middle
Note that all date-related
properties

00:08:06.076 --> 00:08:09.386 A:middle
in the Contacts Framework
are NSDate components.

00:08:10.426 --> 00:08:14.366 A:middle
This allows flexibility
to have dates

00:08:14.366 --> 00:08:15.596 A:middle
such as year-less birthdays,

00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:17.366 A:middle
where you would omit
the year component.

00:08:22.076 --> 00:08:25.456 A:middle
The Contacts Framework is also
able to perform operations

00:08:25.456 --> 00:08:26.826 A:middle
on these contact objects.

00:08:27.806 --> 00:08:30.966 A:middle
Of interest here is
formatting contact data.

00:08:32.616 --> 00:08:35.956 A:middle
The CNContactFormatter will
format a contact's name.

00:08:35.956 --> 00:08:38.905 A:middle
In this example, we're
formatting the full name,

00:08:38.986 --> 00:08:40.275 A:middle
and get back John Appleseed.

00:08:41.775 --> 00:08:44.486 A:middle
CNContact Formatter
will correctly format

00:08:44.486 --> 00:08:45.486 A:middle
international names.

00:08:48.036 --> 00:08:51.366 A:middle
We also have a formatter,
CNPostalAddressFormatter

00:08:51.786 --> 00:08:54.496 A:middle
for formatting mailing
labels for postal addresses.

00:08:55.816 --> 00:08:57.726 A:middle
That returns back...that.

00:08:58.986 --> 00:09:02.896 A:middle
CNPostalAddressFormatter will
correctly format international



00:08:58.986 --> 00:09:02.896 A:middle
CNPostalAddressFormatter will
correctly format international

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:04.086 A:middle
postal addresses.

00:09:05.186 --> 00:09:06.936 A:middle
We recommend that you
use these Formatters

00:09:06.936 --> 00:09:08.356 A:middle
in your app when appropriate.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:14.126 A:middle
Now, I would like to
invite Dave up to the stage

00:09:14.126 --> 00:09:16.216 A:middle
to show you how you can
use Contacts in your app.

you, Bruce.

My name is Dave Dribin, and I
work on the OS X Contacts team.

00:09:29.716 --> 00:09:33.716 A:middle
Sorry. So Bruce just
showed you how to create

00:09:33.716 --> 00:09:35.976 A:middle
and modify CNContact
objects in code.

00:09:36.896 --> 00:09:39.346 A:middle
However, these already
has many contacts as part

00:09:39.346 --> 00:09:43.196 A:middle
of the Contacts app of
OS X, iOS and watchOS.

00:09:44.086 --> 00:09:46.446 A:middle
And Bruce also showed how
system apps can integrate

00:09:46.446 --> 00:09:49.816 A:middle
with these contacts to provide
a richer user experience.

00:09:50.366 --> 00:09:53.116 A:middle
For example, the phone app
can show the person's name

00:09:53.116 --> 00:09:54.636 A:middle
and photo instead of
just a phone number,

00:09:55.326 --> 00:09:57.596 A:middle
for an incoming phone call.

00:09:58.186 --> 00:10:00.096 A:middle
The Contacts Framework
allows you to provide



00:09:58.186 --> 00:10:00.096 A:middle
The Contacts Framework
allows you to provide

00:10:00.096 --> 00:10:01.976 A:middle
that same rich experience

So the class you
are going to use

00:10:06.116 --> 00:10:09.096 A:middle
to access a user's contacts
is called CNContactStore.

00:10:09.096 --> 00:10:11.096 A:middle
We are going to talk
about how to fetch

00:10:11.096 --> 00:10:12.596 A:middle
and save users' contacts.

00:10:13.476 --> 00:10:14.406 A:middle
Let's start off with fetching.

00:10:16.346 --> 00:10:17.216 A:middle
The main method you are going

00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:20.926 A:middle
to use is called unified
ContactsMatchingPredicate,

00:10:20.926 --> 00:10:21.636 A:middle
keysToFetch.

00:10:22.226 --> 00:10:25.406 A:middle
This is going to return an
array of CNContact objects.

00:10:25.956 --> 00:10:29.626 A:middle
The predicate in Keys to
Fetch are there in order

00:10:29.626 --> 00:10:32.126 A:middle
to help your app fetch as
efficiently as possible.

00:10:33.446 --> 00:10:34.526 A:middle
Let's start off with
the predicate.

00:10:35.736 --> 00:10:38.636 A:middle
The user might have hundreds,
or even thousands of contacts.

00:10:38.716 --> 00:10:41.486 A:middle
You might only be interested
in a small subset of those.

00:10:42.566 --> 00:10:44.686 A:middle
The predicate allows you to, ah,

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:46.676 A:middle
helps you limit the
number of results returned.

00:10:48.086 --> 00:10:49.276 A:middle
Now, for those that don't know,

00:10:49.366 --> 00:10:51.896 A:middle
NSPredicate is a standard
foundation-level object

00:10:51.896 --> 00:10:54.556 A:middle
that presents criteria
to be matched

00:10:54.556 --> 00:10:55.956 A:middle
against an object
while searching.

00:10:59.536 --> 00:11:02.936 A:middle
The Contacts Framework
provides predicates you can use



00:10:59.536 --> 00:11:02.936 A:middle
The Contacts Framework
provides predicates you can use

00:11:02.936 --> 00:11:03.926 A:middle
with the contact store.

00:11:03.986 --> 00:11:06.266 A:middle
And the contacts store
will evaluate these

00:11:06.266 --> 00:11:08.166 A:middle
against the predicate,
or the contact.

00:11:08.916 --> 00:11:12.066 A:middle
The example here is predicate
ForContactsMatchingName.

00:11:13.046 --> 00:11:15.966 A:middle
And this will match
each of the contacts

00:11:15.966 --> 00:11:18.146 A:middle
against the specified name,
in this case Appleseed.

00:11:19.016 --> 00:11:19.936 A:middle
Let's see a quick example.

00:11:23.226 --> 00:11:25.026 A:middle
Say the user has
these three contacts.

00:11:25.196 --> 00:11:28.236 A:middle
John Appleseed, Jane
Appleseed, and Craig Bromley.

00:11:29.556 --> 00:11:31.626 A:middle
The contacts store can
effectively evaluate this

00:11:31.686 --> 00:11:33.646 A:middle
predicate [John Appleseed]
against each

00:11:33.646 --> 00:11:34.356 A:middle
of the contacts [Jane
Appleseed; Craig Bromley]

00:11:34.356 --> 00:11:36.256 A:middle
and only return the
matching ones.

00:11:36.566 --> 00:11:38.036 A:middle
In this case John
and Jane are going

00:11:38.036 --> 00:11:39.616 A:middle
to be returned, but not Craig.

00:11:43.266 --> 00:11:45.336 A:middle
So the predicate allows
you to limit the number

00:11:45.466 --> 00:11:47.416 A:middle
of contacts returned,
but there's still a lot

00:11:47.416 --> 00:11:49.226 A:middle
of contact information
on a contact,

00:11:49.226 --> 00:11:51.496 A:middle
and you might only be interested
in a small subset of that,

00:11:52.436 --> 00:11:53.976 A:middle
and that's where
keysToFetch comes in.

00:11:57.596 --> 00:12:00.246 A:middle
KeysToFetch is an
array of strings.



00:11:57.596 --> 00:12:00.246 A:middle
KeysToFetch is an
array of strings.

00:12:00.606 --> 00:12:03.676 A:middle
And these are strings of keys,
in the key-value-coding sense.

00:12:04.216 --> 00:12:06.466 A:middle
So if you are just interested in
the given name and family name,

00:12:06.616 --> 00:12:08.446 A:middle
you could set up your
keysToFetch like this.

00:12:09.256 --> 00:12:11.656 A:middle
Of course, using string
literals is error prone.

00:12:11.786 --> 00:12:13.716 A:middle
We provide constants for this.

00:12:16.346 --> 00:12:18.206 A:middle
And what the Contact Store is
going to do is it's only going

00:12:18.206 --> 00:12:20.546 A:middle
to fetch the properties
that you specify.

00:12:21.646 --> 00:12:23.636 A:middle
In this case, given
name and family name.

00:12:24.626 --> 00:12:26.256 A:middle
So you can really
see how the predicate

00:12:26.256 --> 00:12:28.386 A:middle
in keysToFetch allows you
to scope down the amount

00:12:28.386 --> 00:12:30.256 A:middle
of information to returned
so that your app can be

00:12:30.256 --> 00:12:31.486 A:middle
as efficient as possible.

00:12:32.826 --> 00:12:33.876 A:middle
Let's go over a full example.

00:12:33.876 --> 00:12:37.866 A:middle
So here we are going to
start off with a predicate

00:12:37.866 --> 00:12:39.586 A:middle
and keysToFetch as
we had earlier,

00:12:40.846 --> 00:12:42.606 A:middle
but now you need a contacts
store to use these on.

00:12:42.976 --> 00:12:44.526 A:middle
And this is easy, you
can just create one

00:12:44.626 --> 00:12:45.826 A:middle
with the default initializer.

00:12:47.236 --> 00:12:49.716 A:middle
Then you call unified
ContactsMatchingPredicate,

00:12:49.716 --> 00:12:52.366 A:middle
keysToFetch with those values,
and assuming this works,

00:12:52.476 --> 00:12:55.016 A:middle
you're going to get back
an array of contacts,

00:12:55.956 --> 00:12:57.286 A:middle
and then you can use
them however you want.

00:12:57.286 --> 00:12:58.436 A:middle
Here we are just going to print

00:12:58.436 --> 00:12:59.876 A:middle
out the given name
and family name.



00:13:01.266 --> 00:13:02.576 A:middle
There's a couple of
important things I want

00:13:02.576 --> 00:13:03.406 A:middle
to talk about, about fetching.

00:13:04.036 --> 00:13:06.986 A:middle
The first one is
that the lifetime

00:13:06.986 --> 00:13:08.676 A:middle
of a CNContact is not tied

00:13:08.676 --> 00:13:10.586 A:middle
to the lifetime of
a CNContact store.

00:13:10.586 --> 00:13:13.296 A:middle
There is no need to keep a
strong reference to the Store

00:13:13.296 --> 00:13:15.256 A:middle
around after the
fetch completes.

00:13:16.066 --> 00:13:19.096 A:middle
It means the data on
the CNContact is, ah,

00:13:19.096 --> 00:13:22.166 A:middle
valid and it is from the time of
the fetch, basically a snapshot

00:13:22.166 --> 00:13:23.976 A:middle
from the time of the
fetch, and it is valid

00:13:23.976 --> 00:13:26.146 A:middle
for the lifetime
of that CNContact.

00:13:27.116 --> 00:13:28.506 A:middle
And the second important thing,

00:13:28.506 --> 00:13:30.006 A:middle
is that this is a
synchronous method,

00:13:30.076 --> 00:13:32.906 A:middle
and fetching contacts is a
relatively slow operation.

00:13:34.326 --> 00:13:37.826 A:middle
As such, you should really fetch
these on a background queue,

00:13:38.986 --> 00:13:40.646 A:middle
to keep your user
interface responsive.

00:13:41.896 --> 00:13:43.046 A:middle
And as Bruce mentioned earlier,

00:13:43.046 --> 00:13:46.786 A:middle
CNContacts are completely thread
safe, so it's safe to take these

00:13:46.786 --> 00:13:49.276 A:middle
from the background queue, and
move them over to the main queue

00:13:49.276 --> 00:13:51.106 A:middle
to update your user interface.

00:13:54.046 --> 00:13:55.376 A:middle
And another really
good reason to fetch

00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:57.536 A:middle
on a background queue
is data privacy.



00:14:02.796 --> 00:14:07.146 A:middle
So, users take the privacy of
their contacts very seriously.

00:14:07.676 --> 00:14:10.886 A:middle
And as such, we want to put
up a barrier between your app,

00:14:10.886 --> 00:14:12.006 A:middle
and the users contacts.

00:14:13.476 --> 00:14:17.206 A:middle
The very first time your
app accesses contacts

00:14:17.206 --> 00:14:20.236 A:middle
through the API, the OS is
going to show a dialogue box

00:14:20.236 --> 00:14:22.836 A:middle
or alert asking the user
to allow or deny access.

00:14:22.836 --> 00:14:23.986 A:middle
You have probably
seen these before.

00:14:25.356 --> 00:14:27.666 A:middle
This means that the first
time you call a method

00:14:27.666 --> 00:14:30.086 A:middle
on the contacts store, it
cannot provide the results

00:14:30.446 --> 00:14:33.636 A:middle
until the user responds,
and that can be a long time.

00:14:34.696 --> 00:14:38.006 A:middle
So while you can move your
contacts store access off

00:14:38.006 --> 00:14:41.076 A:middle
to a background queue
using GCD or NS operation,

00:14:41.526 --> 00:14:42.836 A:middle
we provide a helper method here,

00:14:42.836 --> 00:14:44.726 A:middle
an async method called
request access

00:14:44.726 --> 00:14:46.226 A:middle
for entity type completion
handler.

00:14:46.756 --> 00:14:51.006 A:middle
Now the user may deny access,
and your app should be able

00:14:51.006 --> 00:14:51.996 A:middle
to handle this gracefully.

00:14:51.996 --> 00:14:54.526 A:middle
And if the user allows access,

00:14:54.706 --> 00:14:56.766 A:middle
be sure to handle this
contact data with care.

00:14:57.626 --> 00:14:59.356 A:middle
Please see the privacy
in your app session

00:14:59.356 --> 00:14:59.906 A:middle
for more information.



00:15:02.256 --> 00:15:05.156 A:middle
I would like to talk a little
bit more about keysToFetch

00:15:05.156 --> 00:15:06.946 A:middle
and how they return
partial contacts.

00:15:09.206 --> 00:15:11.636 A:middle
So as I showed previously,
the keysToFetch allows you

00:15:11.636 --> 00:15:14.176 A:middle
to only fetch the properties
you are interested in.

00:15:14.716 --> 00:15:17.526 A:middle
In this case the given
name and family name.

00:15:17.676 --> 00:15:19.926 A:middle
What if you tried to access a
property you didn't request--

00:15:20.036 --> 00:15:20.986 A:middle
for example a phone number?

00:15:24.196 --> 00:15:26.086 A:middle
It's going to throw
an exception,

00:15:26.166 --> 00:15:27.766 A:middle
because that data is not there,

00:15:27.766 --> 00:15:30.336 A:middle
and we call these partial
contacts because only some

00:15:30.336 --> 00:15:31.616 A:middle
of the properties are available.

00:15:33.156 --> 00:15:35.086 A:middle
Now normally this isn't
a problem if you set

00:15:35.086 --> 00:15:37.536 A:middle
up your keysToFetch properly,as
we did in the previous examples,

00:15:38.086 --> 00:15:41.176 A:middle
but there are times you
are going to get a contact,

00:15:41.176 --> 00:15:42.146 A:middle
and you are unsure

00:15:42.146 --> 00:15:44.846 A:middle
which keysToFetch was
used when it was fetched.

00:15:45.506 --> 00:15:47.356 A:middle
In those cases, you are
going to want to check to see

00:15:47.356 --> 00:15:49.906 A:middle
if the key is available
before accessing the property,

00:15:50.526 --> 00:15:51.726 A:middle
just as you would
check the length

00:15:51.726 --> 00:15:54.096 A:middle
of an array before indexing
into it, to avoid an exception.

00:15:55.186 --> 00:15:57.986 A:middle
Here this example is using the
isKeyAvailable method to see

00:15:57.986 --> 00:15:59.596 A:middle
if the PhoneNumbers
key is available

00:15:59.596 --> 00:16:01.216 A:middle
for accessing the
phone numbers property.



00:15:59.596 --> 00:16:01.216 A:middle
for accessing the
phone numbers property.

00:16:01.216 --> 00:16:04.106 A:middle
You might be thinking
"well, that's great,

00:16:04.106 --> 00:16:06.066 A:middle
but I really wanted to
access those phone numbers."

00:16:06.836 --> 00:16:08.606 A:middle
In those cases, you can
re-fetch the contact

00:16:08.606 --> 00:16:09.866 A:middle
with the additional keysToFetch.

00:16:10.436 --> 00:16:11.536 A:middle
Let's see how that would work.

00:16:12.406 --> 00:16:15.156 A:middle
So, here we are setting
up keysToFetch,

00:16:15.156 --> 00:16:16.886 A:middle
but this time we're using
the phone numbers key,

00:16:17.896 --> 00:16:21.206 A:middle
and using a method called
unifiedContactWithIdentifier.

00:16:21.556 --> 00:16:23.776 A:middle
Now each contact
has a identifier

00:16:23.776 --> 00:16:26.416 A:middle
that uniquely identifies it,
and you can use to re-fetch

00:16:26.416 --> 00:16:29.336 A:middle
at a later point in time.

00:16:29.336 --> 00:16:31.026 A:middle
And then, once you re-fetch,

00:16:31.296 --> 00:16:32.696 A:middle
you can safely access
the phone numbers

00:16:32.696 --> 00:16:33.796 A:middle
on this re-fetched contact.

00:16:34.276 --> 00:16:37.306 A:middle
In partial contacts
it's important

00:16:37.306 --> 00:16:39.746 A:middle
to understand how they work
with the rest of the framework.

00:16:43.046 --> 00:16:45.476 A:middle
Now, the previous example showed
how we fetched the given name

00:16:45.476 --> 00:16:46.836 A:middle
and family name and
then printed them out,

00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:49.426 A:middle
to print the full name, but
that's really not ideal.

00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:51.626 A:middle
We should really use one
of the formatters, sorry,

00:16:51.776 --> 00:16:54.546 A:middle
the CNContact formatter
that Bruce showed earlier,

00:16:54.586 --> 00:16:57.276 A:middle
and the formatter may
access other properties

00:16:57.276 --> 00:16:59.496 A:middle
that you haven't fetched,
like name, prefix, or suffix.

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:01.766 A:middle
If they're not there, it's
going to throw an exception.



00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:01.766 A:middle
If they're not there, it's
going to throw an exception.

00:17:02.406 --> 00:17:06.356 A:middle
So, we could document all
the keys you need in order

00:17:06.356 --> 00:17:08.546 A:middle
to use the formatter, but that's
rather tedious and error prone.

00:17:09.016 --> 00:17:11.306 A:middle
So we've come up with the
concept of key descriptors.

00:17:12.556 --> 00:17:15.886 A:middle
And key descriptors
represent a set of keys

00:17:16.165 --> 00:17:18.126 A:middle
for a particular operation.

00:17:18.626 --> 00:17:20.736 A:middle
In this case, the formatter
knows which keys it needs

00:17:20.736 --> 00:17:23.226 A:middle
to do its job, so it is
providing the key descriptors

00:17:23.705 --> 00:17:26.175 A:middle
with the descriptor
ForRequiredKeysForStyle method,

00:17:26.376 --> 00:17:28.396 A:middle
and you can include this
directly in your keys to fetch.

00:17:29.346 --> 00:17:32.736 A:middle
And this tells the contact
store all of the properties

00:17:32.736 --> 00:17:34.146 A:middle
that it needs to fetch
for the formatter.

00:17:35.046 --> 00:17:36.226 A:middle
Let's see an example of this.

00:17:36.226 --> 00:17:40.676 A:middle
So in this example, we
want to fetch all contacts

00:17:40.676 --> 00:17:41.626 A:middle
with the name Appleseed,

00:17:41.796 --> 00:17:44.356 A:middle
and we want to print their
full name and e-mail addresses.

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:47.336 A:middle
We are going to set up the
predicate as we did before,

00:17:47.396 --> 00:17:49.526 A:middle
and set up the keysToFetch
a little bit differently.

00:17:49.566 --> 00:17:53.686 A:middle
We are going to start off with
descriptor for required keys

00:17:53.686 --> 00:17:55.156 A:middle
for style (.FullName).

00:17:55.156 --> 00:17:58.066 A:middle
And this is going to, uh,
allows us to get the full name,

00:17:58.106 --> 00:18:00.216 A:middle
using the Contact
Formatter later on.



00:17:58.106 --> 00:18:00.216 A:middle
using the Contact
Formatter later on.

00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:04.816 A:middle
You can also include the
CNContact e-mail addresses key,

00:18:04.816 --> 00:18:06.366 A:middle
because we want to print
the e-mail addresses.

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:09.116 A:middle
You can intermix key descriptors

00:18:09.386 --> 00:18:11.786 A:middle
and CNContact keys
in the same array.

00:18:12.416 --> 00:18:16.476 A:middle
With this setup, you fetch,
just as we did before,

00:18:16.476 --> 00:18:18.516 A:middle
calling unified contacts
matching predicate,

00:18:18.516 --> 00:18:21.886 A:middle
and then with the results,
you can get the full name

00:18:21.886 --> 00:18:23.906 A:middle
with the formatter and
the e-mail addresses.

00:18:26.476 --> 00:18:27.946 A:middle
So one other important point

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:30.216 A:middle
about fetching is
unified contacts.

00:18:31.286 --> 00:18:33.676 A:middle
You may have the same
contact in multiple accounts.

00:18:33.676 --> 00:18:35.096 A:middle
For example, you might
have a John Appleseed

00:18:35.206 --> 00:18:37.506 A:middle
in your iCloud account with
his work e-mail address

00:18:37.506 --> 00:18:39.536 A:middle
and phone number, but
you might also be friends

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:40.416 A:middle
with John on Facebook.

00:18:40.416 --> 00:18:42.516 A:middle
And that is going
to have an image,

00:18:42.966 --> 00:18:44.986 A:middle
home e-mail address,
and birthday.

00:18:45.596 --> 00:18:48.056 A:middle
So rather than display two
separate contacts there,

00:18:48.656 --> 00:18:51.256 A:middle
the contacts app is going
to use some heuristics

00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:54.426 A:middle
to link these together, and
display a single contact

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:55.706 A:middle
with the union of
the information,

00:18:55.706 --> 00:18:57.376 A:middle
and we call these
unified contacts.

00:18:57.936 --> 00:19:00.286 A:middle
And contacts apps
have been doing this



00:18:57.936 --> 00:19:00.286 A:middle
And contacts apps
have been doing this

00:19:00.286 --> 00:19:01.186 A:middle
for a few releases now.

00:19:02.206 --> 00:19:05.066 A:middle
The Contacts Framework will
return unified contacts

00:19:05.066 --> 00:19:07.546 A:middle
by default, as you may have
guessed from the method names.

00:19:08.806 --> 00:19:10.776 A:middle
So the good news is, that
means that you're going

00:19:10.776 --> 00:19:13.166 A:middle
to get the data back that
the user sees in the app.

00:19:14.276 --> 00:19:15.166 A:middle
The really great thing here is

00:19:15.166 --> 00:19:17.676 A:middle
that these are ordinary
CNContact objects, and they work

00:19:17.676 --> 00:19:19.736 A:middle
and act just like any
other CNContact object.

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:24.026 A:middle
you can even modify them and
save them and it will just work.

00:19:25.456 --> 00:19:27.936 A:middle
So speaking of saving, let's
go over a few code examples

00:19:28.366 --> 00:19:29.656 A:middle
on how to save contacts.

00:19:29.916 --> 00:19:33.296 A:middle
I'm going to start off
by adding a new contact.

00:19:35.086 --> 00:19:37.046 A:middle
So let's say you've got
a C immutable contact,

00:19:37.046 --> 00:19:39.016 A:middle
and you set it up with data,
as Bruce showed you earlier.

00:19:39.566 --> 00:19:41.996 A:middle
In order to get this into the
user's contacts, you are going

00:19:41.996 --> 00:19:44.036 A:middle
to use what's called a save
request, and you are going

00:19:44.036 --> 00:19:46.356 A:middle
to execute that save
request on a contact store.

00:19:46.976 --> 00:19:51.496 A:middle
The first thing you do is create
a new CNSaveRequest object,

00:19:51.496 --> 00:19:54.146 A:middle
and then you are going
to call add contact,

00:19:54.146 --> 00:19:55.656 A:middle
to container with identifier.

00:19:56.866 --> 00:19:58.726 A:middle
Now we don't have time
to talk about containers,

00:19:59.216 --> 00:20:01.696 A:middle
but the nil container identifier
means the default container,



00:19:59.216 --> 00:20:01.696 A:middle
but the nil container identifier
means the default container,

00:20:02.066 --> 00:20:02.836 A:middle
and, so please refer

00:20:02.836 --> 00:20:04.326 A:middle
to the documentation
for more information.

00:20:04.606 --> 00:20:08.056 A:middle
And save request just marks
a contact for being added.

00:20:08.056 --> 00:20:10.106 A:middle
It doesn't actually
apply this change yet.

00:20:10.476 --> 00:20:12.296 A:middle
For that you need to
call execute SaveRequest

00:20:12.326 --> 00:20:13.296 A:middle
on a contacts store.

00:20:13.796 --> 00:20:16.446 A:middle
Assuming this completes
successfully, this will be added

00:20:16.446 --> 00:20:17.406 A:middle
to the user's contacts.

00:20:21.076 --> 00:20:23.696 A:middle
Updating an existing
contact is very similar,

00:20:23.696 --> 00:20:25.476 A:middle
but now you are going to
be starting off with, say,

00:20:25.476 --> 00:20:27.656 A:middle
an immutable contact that
you got from a fetch.

00:20:29.136 --> 00:20:30.206 A:middle
So, the first thing
you are going to want

00:20:30.206 --> 00:20:32.236 A:middle
to do is create a mutable copy,

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:34.286 A:middle
and then make any
changes you want.

00:20:34.286 --> 00:20:36.846 A:middle
For example, here we are
adding in a new e-mail address.

00:20:36.846 --> 00:20:39.066 A:middle
Now, it is important
to note that,

00:20:39.066 --> 00:20:41.706 A:middle
when you make a mutable
copy of a partial contact,

00:20:42.096 --> 00:20:45.536 A:middle
only modify the property
that you had fetched.

00:20:49.086 --> 00:20:51.366 A:middle
And just as before, we
need to use a save request.

00:20:52.276 --> 00:20:54.036 A:middle
Create a new save request,
but this time we are going

00:20:54.036 --> 00:20:55.486 A:middle
to use the updateContact method.

00:20:56.616 --> 00:20:58.816 A:middle
And again, this just marks
the contact for being updated,

00:20:58.816 --> 00:21:00.266 A:middle
and doesn't actually
apply those changes



00:20:58.816 --> 00:21:00.266 A:middle
and doesn't actually
apply those changes

00:21:00.976 --> 00:21:02.676 A:middle
until you call
executeSaveRequest.

00:21:03.276 --> 00:21:07.036 A:middle
And, a couple of important
things about saving.

00:21:07.606 --> 00:21:10.786 A:middle
Number one is that the save
request can include multiple

00:21:10.786 --> 00:21:12.686 A:middle
changes, and when
you execute it,

00:21:12.686 --> 00:21:14.896 A:middle
all of them will be
applied during, um,

00:21:14.896 --> 00:21:15.836 A:middle
when it gets executed.

00:21:16.406 --> 00:21:21.336 A:middle
And the second is that the
save request requires mutable

00:21:21.336 --> 00:21:23.566 A:middle
contacts, so you want
to be careful not

00:21:23.566 --> 00:21:25.966 A:middle
to access these mutable
contacts on another thread,

00:21:26.056 --> 00:21:26.976 A:middle
while a save is in process.

00:21:29.316 --> 00:21:30.966 A:middle
So now that you know
how to fetch

00:21:31.256 --> 00:21:34.976 A:middle
and save a user's contacts,
I'll invite Julien up on stage

00:21:34.976 --> 00:21:37.456 A:middle
to talk about using contacts
in the user interface.

00:21:39.516 --> 00:21:43.106 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:43.606 --> 00:21:45.166 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JULIEN ROBERT:
Thank you, Dave.

00:21:47.356 --> 00:21:48.606 A:middle
Good afternoon.

00:21:48.606 --> 00:21:51.686 A:middle
I'm Julien and I'm an engineer
in the iOS contacts team.

00:21:52.676 --> 00:21:57.296 A:middle
And now that Bruce and
Dave made you experts

00:21:57.296 --> 00:22:00.886 A:middle
in the Contacts Framework, I
will talk about user interface



00:21:57.296 --> 00:22:00.886 A:middle
in the Contacts Framework, I
will talk about user interface

00:22:01.616 --> 00:22:06.186 A:middle
and show you how to pick and
display contacts in your app.

00:22:07.576 --> 00:22:10.276 A:middle
Coming along with Contacts
Framework we have a new UI

00:22:10.366 --> 00:22:13.416 A:middle
Framework called contacts UI.

00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:17.946 A:middle
It is available on both
iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan.

00:22:18.996 --> 00:22:23.406 A:middle
This provides you with two
clusters, first the picker,

00:22:23.646 --> 00:22:27.146 A:middle
which displays a list of
all the users contacts,

00:22:27.146 --> 00:22:30.136 A:middle
to let him selectively
import contact information

00:22:30.136 --> 00:22:31.586 A:middle
into your app.

00:22:32.286 --> 00:22:35.136 A:middle
And secondly, the
contact view controller,

00:22:35.546 --> 00:22:37.186 A:middle
which is used to
display a contact.

00:22:37.846 --> 00:22:40.536 A:middle
In the rest of this
presentation I will talk

00:22:40.536 --> 00:22:42.846 A:middle
about the iOS version
of the classes,

00:22:43.696 --> 00:22:46.626 A:middle
but the OS X counterparts
are pretty similar.

00:22:47.306 --> 00:22:50.846 A:middle
Let's talk about
picking contact first.

00:22:51.756 --> 00:22:54.416 A:middle
The class you use for
that is CNContact Picker

00:22:54.416 --> 00:22:55.166 A:middle
View Controller.

00:22:56.016 --> 00:22:58.896 A:middle
It is a direct replacement
of the class we had

00:22:58.946 --> 00:23:03.276 A:middle
in Address Book UI, AB People
Picker Navigation Controller.



00:22:58.946 --> 00:23:03.276 A:middle
in Address Book UI, AB People
Picker Navigation Controller.

00:23:04.616 --> 00:23:08.206 A:middle
As you can guess by its
name, it is a direct subclass

00:23:08.206 --> 00:23:11.546 A:middle
of UA View Controller but
you still must present it,

00:23:11.646 --> 00:23:13.696 A:middle
and not push it in a
navigation controller.

00:23:15.296 --> 00:23:17.736 A:middle
It is always out of process.

00:23:18.076 --> 00:23:22.186 A:middle
It has the great advantage
of not requiring the user

00:23:22.246 --> 00:23:25.146 A:middle
to let your app access
its contacts.

00:23:26.196 --> 00:23:29.266 A:middle
So when you present
a contact picker,

00:23:29.266 --> 00:23:32.976 A:middle
you will never see the dialogue
that Bruce -- that Dave showed.

00:23:35.656 --> 00:23:36.866 A:middle
One thing that is important is

00:23:36.866 --> 00:23:39.566 A:middle
that the contact picker may
return partial contacts.

00:23:40.016 --> 00:23:42.996 A:middle
For example, if you
set a limited set

00:23:43.426 --> 00:23:47.506 A:middle
of displayed property keys,
you will only get those keys

00:23:47.986 --> 00:23:49.516 A:middle
in the contact that
you get back.

00:23:50.256 --> 00:23:54.556 A:middle
And the behavior of the picker
is defined by two things,

00:23:55.166 --> 00:23:58.656 A:middle
first the delegate method that
you implement, and second,

00:23:58.656 --> 00:24:00.636 A:middle
the predicate that
you set on it.



00:23:58.656 --> 00:24:00.636 A:middle
the predicate that
you set on it.

00:24:00.946 --> 00:24:03.486 A:middle
And we are going to talk
about those just after.

00:24:04.386 --> 00:24:06.536 A:middle
But last but not
least the picker must

00:24:06.536 --> 00:24:07.856 A:middle
support multiselection.

00:24:09.516 --> 00:24:13.246 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:13.746 --> 00:24:16.016 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JULIEN ROBERT: Let's talk
about the delegate method first.

00:24:17.336 --> 00:24:20.326 A:middle
So if your app is interested
by a single contact,

00:24:20.326 --> 00:24:23.856 A:middle
and you want have this
familiar look of the picker,

00:24:24.856 --> 00:24:28.516 A:middle
you simply need to implement
the didSelectContact delegate

00:24:28.516 --> 00:24:31.596 A:middle
method, and you get
a CNContact back.

00:24:32.286 --> 00:24:34.496 A:middle
So again, these contacts
may be partial.

00:24:35.116 --> 00:24:38.536 A:middle
If you are interested
in a single property,

00:24:39.086 --> 00:24:41.646 A:middle
you implement a did Select
Contact Property delegate

00:24:41.646 --> 00:24:44.546 A:middle
method, and you get a
CNContactProperty object.

00:24:45.536 --> 00:24:48.016 A:middle
So, this object is actually
from the Contacts Framework

00:24:48.016 --> 00:24:50.876 A:middle
but we haven't seen it
before, so let's take a look.

00:24:52.386 --> 00:24:55.506 A:middle
It is a simple wrapper class
that contains the contact

00:24:55.536 --> 00:24:59.266 A:middle
that was selected, as well
as the key of the property

00:24:59.266 --> 00:25:00.886 A:middle
that was selected by the user.



00:24:59.266 --> 00:25:00.886 A:middle
that was selected by the user.

00:25:01.606 --> 00:25:04.786 A:middle
Its value and potentially,
the identifier,

00:25:04.786 --> 00:25:07.736 A:middle
is the property,
is labeled value.

00:25:10.046 --> 00:25:15.716 A:middle
But you may also be interested
in having multiple contacts.

00:25:15.716 --> 00:25:18.256 A:middle
And you would get
this appearance.

00:25:19.366 --> 00:25:20.666 A:middle
To do that is very simple.

00:25:20.666 --> 00:25:24.566 A:middle
You just implement the
didSelectContact delegate

00:25:24.566 --> 00:25:26.776 A:middle
method, and you get as expected,

00:25:26.776 --> 00:25:28.676 A:middle
an array of sent
contact objects.

00:25:30.056 --> 00:25:34.776 A:middle
This also works for properties,
you can get multiple of them

00:25:34.776 --> 00:25:37.446 A:middle
by implementing the
didSelectContactProperties

00:25:38.186 --> 00:25:41.626 A:middle
delegate method, and get an
array of CNContact properties.

00:25:43.186 --> 00:25:43.486 A:middle
All right.

00:25:44.766 --> 00:25:46.326 A:middle
So now let's talk
about predicates.

00:25:46.906 --> 00:25:50.766 A:middle
Predicates lets you customize
the behavior of the panel

00:25:50.766 --> 00:25:53.206 A:middle
and we have three of them.

00:25:53.706 --> 00:25:56.356 A:middle
The first one is predicate
for enabling contact.

00:25:57.066 --> 00:26:01.326 A:middle
This lets you decide which
contacts are available



00:25:57.066 --> 00:26:01.326 A:middle
This lets you decide which
contacts are available

00:26:01.326 --> 00:26:02.706 A:middle
to the user and which are not.

00:26:03.426 --> 00:26:05.946 A:middle
If I take the example
that we've seen earlier,

00:26:05.946 --> 00:26:09.716 A:middle
and if you want a user
to only select members

00:26:09.716 --> 00:26:12.176 A:middle
of the Parker family,
for example,

00:26:12.676 --> 00:26:16.026 A:middle
you would create a predicate
where you want to match contacts

00:26:16.026 --> 00:26:17.826 A:middle
with the Parker family name.

00:26:17.896 --> 00:26:22.136 A:middle
You set it as a
predicateForEnablingContact.

00:26:22.756 --> 00:26:24.606 A:middle
And once the picker
is represented,

00:26:24.606 --> 00:26:28.326 A:middle
you can see that you
can only select people

00:26:28.326 --> 00:26:30.486 A:middle
with the Parker family name.

00:26:31.636 --> 00:26:36.526 A:middle
The second one that we have is
predicate ForSelectionOfContact.

00:26:37.366 --> 00:26:41.706 A:middle
This one is evaluated when the
user will tap on the contact.

00:26:42.306 --> 00:26:43.866 A:middle
And if it evaluates to true,

00:26:43.866 --> 00:26:46.166 A:middle
then the contact is
returned to your app.

00:26:46.596 --> 00:26:50.576 A:middle
Otherwise we will
display the contact card.

00:26:50.806 --> 00:26:52.876 A:middle
Similarly for properties
we have predicate

00:26:52.876 --> 00:26:54.286 A:middle
ForSelectionOf Property.

00:26:55.386 --> 00:26:58.916 A:middle
And if it evaluates to true,
the property that is tapped

00:26:58.916 --> 00:27:01.246 A:middle
by the user will be
returned to your app,



00:26:58.916 --> 00:27:01.246 A:middle
by the user will be
returned to your app,

00:27:01.566 --> 00:27:03.646 A:middle
otherwise the default
action will be performed,

00:27:04.006 --> 00:27:06.826 A:middle
such as making a phone call
or creating a new e-mail.

00:27:08.026 --> 00:27:11.376 A:middle
One thing to note is that this
last predicate is evaluated

00:27:11.376 --> 00:27:13.186 A:middle
on [the] CNContactProperty
object,

00:27:13.726 --> 00:27:17.456 A:middle
whereas the first two are
evaluated on CNContact objects.

00:27:17.456 --> 00:27:22.586 A:middle
I would like to point out
that you need to be coherent

00:27:23.026 --> 00:27:24.916 A:middle
between the predicates you set

00:27:24.916 --> 00:27:26.766 A:middle
and the delegate methods
that you implement.

00:27:27.226 --> 00:27:29.796 A:middle
For example, you should only
implement the didSelectContact

00:27:29.796 --> 00:27:33.726 A:middle
delegate method, but set
the predicate for selection

00:27:33.876 --> 00:27:37.816 A:middle
of property predicate, then,
doesn't really make sense,

00:27:37.816 --> 00:27:40.406 A:middle
and you would see a log, and
your predicate will be ignored.

00:27:44.046 --> 00:27:46.956 A:middle
Right, so now that you
know how to pick contacts,

00:27:46.956 --> 00:27:48.806 A:middle
let's talk about
viewing them in your app.

00:27:49.946 --> 00:27:51.886 A:middle
So we now have just one class

00:27:51.886 --> 00:27:56.796 A:middle
to replace the three classes
what we had in Address Book UI.

00:27:56.996 --> 00:27:59.856 A:middle
But you can still get the
behavior that you want



00:28:00.446 --> 00:28:02.726 A:middle
by using the appropriate
creation method.

00:28:04.336 --> 00:28:07.546 A:middle
The first one is
viewControllerForContact,

00:28:07.916 --> 00:28:11.646 A:middle
which would give you a view
controller that is the same

00:28:11.706 --> 00:28:14.946 A:middle
as in contacts app, iPhone app.

00:28:15.856 --> 00:28:18.386 A:middle
If you want to create
a new contact,

00:28:18.386 --> 00:28:20.266 A:middle
you can use
viewControllerForNewContact,

00:28:20.266 --> 00:28:24.416 A:middle
and you get this View Controller
which is always in editing mode.

00:28:25.106 --> 00:28:28.906 A:middle
And lastly, if you
have a contact that is

00:28:28.906 --> 00:28:32.296 A:middle
from an unknown origin, such
as a vCard, for example,

00:28:32.656 --> 00:28:34.496 A:middle
you use
viewControllerForUnknownContact.

00:28:35.506 --> 00:28:40.056 A:middle
One thing we've added in iOS 9
is this update contact button

00:28:40.666 --> 00:28:42.816 A:middle
which will be displayed
automatically

00:28:43.046 --> 00:28:44.606 A:middle
if there is already a contact

00:28:44.606 --> 00:28:46.906 A:middle
in the user's contact
matching the name

00:28:47.326 --> 00:28:48.666 A:middle
of the contact you
are displaying.

00:28:49.056 --> 00:28:53.056 A:middle
And if the user taps on
it, it will display the UI

00:28:53.056 --> 00:28:55.266 A:middle
to update the existing contact
with the new information.

00:28:55.766 --> 00:29:01.156 A:middle
This Contact View Controller
is now always out of process,



00:28:55.766 --> 00:29:01.156 A:middle
This Contact View Controller
is now always out of process,

00:29:01.806 --> 00:29:03.036 A:middle
and the reason for that is

00:29:03.476 --> 00:29:05.796 A:middle
that we may add some
additional information

00:29:06.216 --> 00:29:11.046 A:middle
such as contacts data
that was found in mail.

00:29:11.246 --> 00:29:14.246 A:middle
And as Dave pointed
out, it is important

00:29:14.436 --> 00:29:17.636 A:middle
to fetch the contacts
using the right keys.

00:29:18.456 --> 00:29:21.006 A:middle
So if you want to display it in
the Contacts View Controller,

00:29:21.006 --> 00:29:24.496 A:middle
it must be fetched using the
descriptorForRequiredKeys

00:29:24.636 --> 00:29:25.856 A:middle
of the Contacts View Controller.

00:29:28.536 --> 00:29:32.076 A:middle
So let's look at a quick
code example on how

00:29:32.076 --> 00:29:34.496 A:middle
to display a contact
from an identifier.

00:29:35.456 --> 00:29:37.566 A:middle
First you would fetch
the contact

00:29:37.566 --> 00:29:39.626 A:middle
with the
descriptorForRequiredKeys

00:29:39.826 --> 00:29:41.166 A:middle
of the Contact View Controller.

00:29:42.746 --> 00:29:47.406 A:middle
Then you create the Contact
View Controller with forContact,

00:29:47.506 --> 00:29:51.846 A:middle
because we want a regular look
at the Contact View Controller.

00:29:51.846 --> 00:29:55.386 A:middle
If you already have a contact
store, you should set it

00:29:55.386 --> 00:29:58.736 A:middle
to the Contacts View Controller
so that we can reuse it.

00:29:59.286 --> 00:30:01.086 A:middle
Set self as a delegate.



00:29:59.286 --> 00:30:01.086 A:middle
Set self as a delegate.

00:30:02.326 --> 00:30:03.816 A:middle
Push the View Controller.

00:30:04.306 --> 00:30:07.706 A:middle
And then in your delegate
method you will get called

00:30:07.706 --> 00:30:09.136 A:middle
when the contact is modified.

00:30:09.766 --> 00:30:13.556 A:middle
Alright, so it is nice
to look at a code sample,

00:30:13.556 --> 00:30:17.846 A:middle
but what is better is [to]
build an app together,

00:30:18.556 --> 00:30:19.746 A:middle
let's do that now.

00:30:24.046 --> 00:30:27.006 A:middle
And the app we are going
to build is called Meow.

00:30:27.946 --> 00:30:32.406 A:middle
And it's an app that lets
you share your emotions

00:30:32.566 --> 00:30:35.976 A:middle
with your friends by
sending them cat sounds.

00:30:38.046 --> 00:30:43.086 A:middle
So if I run the app, you can see
at the top is a mood selector.

00:30:43.086 --> 00:30:47.276 A:middle
And then at the bottom is your
friends list, which is empty

00:30:47.276 --> 00:30:49.386 A:middle
for now, and this is what
we are going to build now.

00:30:50.836 --> 00:30:54.386 A:middle
The app is using an e-mail
address to send the cat sounds.

00:30:55.556 --> 00:31:00.026 A:middle
So what we need is just a
nickname and e-mail address.



00:30:55.556 --> 00:31:00.026 A:middle
So what we need is just a
nickname and e-mail address.

00:31:00.026 --> 00:31:04.716 A:middle
So if I hit save,
nothing happens

00:31:04.716 --> 00:31:06.666 A:middle
because it is not
implemented yet.

00:31:06.976 --> 00:31:09.996 A:middle
So this is what we
are going to do.

00:31:10.236 --> 00:31:14.616 A:middle
When I hit save, this
addBuddy function is called,

00:31:14.616 --> 00:31:16.566 A:middle
and we will implement it now.

00:31:17.836 --> 00:31:19.816 A:middle
First we create a
mutable contact

00:31:19.816 --> 00:31:21.596 A:middle
because we are going
to modify it.

00:31:22.066 --> 00:31:25.186 A:middle
Then we set the nickname to be
the value from the text field.

00:31:25.186 --> 00:31:30.736 A:middle
The emailAddresses
property is set as an array

00:31:31.366 --> 00:31:33.316 A:middle
of a single label value.

00:31:33.846 --> 00:31:36.386 A:middle
We have the value being
from the text field.

00:31:36.386 --> 00:31:41.306 A:middle
And finally we add this new
contact to our list of contacts.

00:31:42.326 --> 00:31:45.686 A:middle
So let's run and see
how it works now.

00:31:48.406 --> 00:31:51.756 A:middle
So I'm going to use prefilled
values, and add Emily

00:31:51.756 --> 00:31:55.096 A:middle
to my friends, OK, my family.

00:31:55.986 --> 00:31:58.246 A:middle
You can notice this
info button here.

00:31:58.246 --> 00:32:00.656 A:middle
And we want to show
the contact view



00:31:58.246 --> 00:32:00.656 A:middle
And we want to show
the contact view

00:32:01.036 --> 00:32:02.866 A:middle
when we click on
this info button.

00:32:04.156 --> 00:32:05.946 A:middle
So this is what we are
going to implement now.

00:32:09.056 --> 00:32:13.866 A:middle
So when I tap this button, the
showContact function is called.

00:32:14.516 --> 00:32:17.006 A:middle
So let's fill it in.

00:32:17.836 --> 00:32:21.106 A:middle
First we create a Contact View
Controller for the contact

00:32:21.416 --> 00:32:24.646 A:middle
that was, ah, that
we want to show.

00:32:25.236 --> 00:32:28.126 A:middle
Then we set the contacts store
to the one we already have.

00:32:28.126 --> 00:32:30.906 A:middle
And finally, we push
the View Controller.

00:32:34.836 --> 00:32:39.826 A:middle
Let's just try, and okay, we
can see the info for Emily.

00:32:40.596 --> 00:32:44.266 A:middle
Great. But what if we want
to add a contact in our list,

00:32:44.596 --> 00:32:46.326 A:middle
that is already in
the user's contacts?

00:32:47.436 --> 00:32:49.366 A:middle
So this is what we
are going to do here.

00:32:49.366 --> 00:32:52.516 A:middle
And for that we are going
to use the contact picker.

00:32:53.226 --> 00:32:58.896 A:middle
So this function is called
when I tap on addFromContacts.

00:32:58.896 --> 00:33:01.226 A:middle
And I am going to
implement it now.



00:32:58.896 --> 00:33:01.226 A:middle
And I am going to
implement it now.

00:33:01.696 --> 00:33:07.566 A:middle
First thing I'm doing is create
the contact picker controller.

00:33:08.206 --> 00:33:10.956 A:middle
Then since we are only
interested in e-mail addresses,

00:33:11.666 --> 00:33:14.636 A:middle
I limit the properties
to e-mail addresses.

00:33:16.256 --> 00:33:23.386 A:middle
Then we want, ah, to, the user
to select contacts who have only

00:33:23.896 --> 00:33:25.756 A:middle
at least one e-mail address.

00:33:25.886 --> 00:33:29.056 A:middle
We see this is the part of the
predicate that is doing that.

00:33:29.546 --> 00:33:32.406 A:middle
And who are not already
in our list of friends,

00:33:32.606 --> 00:33:36.046 A:middle
because we don't
want duplicates.

00:33:36.046 --> 00:33:38.916 A:middle
Finally, is the user,
is contact already,

00:33:39.206 --> 00:33:42.566 A:middle
[who] has exactly one e-mail
address, we don't need

00:33:42.566 --> 00:33:45.216 A:middle
to push the [card?], We want
it to be written directly.

00:33:46.026 --> 00:33:48.436 A:middle
This is what this
predicate is doing.

00:33:48.876 --> 00:33:53.616 A:middle
We set ourself as a delegate and
we present the View Controller.

00:33:55.356 --> 00:34:01.206 A:middle
We also need delegate methods
where we add the new contact



00:33:55.356 --> 00:34:01.206 A:middle
We also need delegate methods
where we add the new contact

00:34:01.206 --> 00:34:02.326 A:middle
to our list of contacts.

00:34:03.596 --> 00:34:04.976 A:middle
So it is straight now.

00:34:05.456 --> 00:34:11.676 A:middle
And if I select John Appleseed,
I know he has two e-mails.

00:34:12.366 --> 00:34:14.396 A:middle
So the contact card is pushed.

00:34:14.956 --> 00:34:17.556 A:middle
I would select one e-mail,
and we have John in our list.

00:34:19.016 --> 00:34:22.166 A:middle
If I add a new contact,
first you can see

00:34:22.166 --> 00:34:24.456 A:middle
that now John Appleseed
is unavailable

00:34:24.456 --> 00:34:26.396 A:middle
because he is already
in my friends list.

00:34:27.306 --> 00:34:31.116 A:middle
But if I select David, he
just has one e-mail address.

00:34:31.116 --> 00:34:32.696 A:middle
So the contact is
returned directly.

00:34:33.266 --> 00:34:38.456 A:middle
So what happens if I want
to show the card for John?

00:34:39.696 --> 00:34:41.045 A:middle
So we have an exception.

00:34:41.545 --> 00:34:44.876 A:middle
And the reason is that
because we were not careful

00:34:45.306 --> 00:34:48.815 A:middle
when presenting the
contact here,

00:34:49.056 --> 00:34:53.456 A:middle
because the contact picker
returned the partial contacts,

00:34:53.456 --> 00:34:56.146 A:middle
it is missing some keys for
the Contact View Controller.

00:34:56.146 --> 00:35:03.266 A:middle
So we are going to fix
that by first checking



00:34:56.146 --> 00:35:03.266 A:middle
So we are going to fix
that by first checking

00:35:03.266 --> 00:35:05.836 A:middle
if the contact has the
required keys to be used

00:35:06.296 --> 00:35:07.996 A:middle
in the Contact View Controller.

00:35:08.426 --> 00:35:12.516 A:middle
And if he does, we just use
the code that we had before.

00:35:13.306 --> 00:35:16.586 A:middle
But if he does not, we
will first ask the Store

00:35:16.586 --> 00:35:18.626 A:middle
to request access for contacts.

00:35:19.846 --> 00:35:23.426 A:middle
If the user grants access,
we are going to have

00:35:23.526 --> 00:35:27.026 A:middle
to re-fetch the contact
using its identifier.

00:35:27.026 --> 00:35:32.236 A:middle
And this time using the
keysToFetch, the descriptor

00:35:32.236 --> 00:35:35.536 A:middle
for recorded keys of the
CNContactViewController.

00:35:36.766 --> 00:35:40.306 A:middle
Then we call the same
function again but this time

00:35:40.306 --> 00:35:45.266 A:middle
with our complete
contacts ready to be used.

00:35:45.266 --> 00:35:48.966 A:middle
So let's try again.

00:35:48.966 --> 00:35:52.136 A:middle
So if I view the
contact card for Emily,

00:35:52.886 --> 00:35:54.186 A:middle
we have no dialogue showing

00:35:54.186 --> 00:35:58.936 A:middle
up because Emily
was created in code.

00:35:58.936 --> 00:36:00.366 A:middle
So she has all the fetch keys.



00:35:58.936 --> 00:36:00.366 A:middle
So she has all the fetch keys.

00:36:00.946 --> 00:36:04.776 A:middle
If I do the same on John,
I re-fetch is necessary.

00:36:05.526 --> 00:36:08.206 A:middle
So at this point your app will
access the user's contact.

00:36:09.476 --> 00:36:12.846 A:middle
So we say okay, and we can see
all the contact information

00:36:12.906 --> 00:36:13.306 A:middle
for John.

00:36:13.306 --> 00:36:13.946 A:middle
All right.

00:36:15.736 --> 00:36:19.276 A:middle
So this concludes our demo.

00:36:19.546 --> 00:36:20.946 A:middle
Which makes me a bit sad.

00:36:20.946 --> 00:36:24.246 A:middle
So I will share my
emotions with John.

00:36:24.246 --> 00:36:25.976 A:middle
(Sound of cat crying.)

00:36:26.516 --> 00:36:31.946 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:36:32.446 --> 00:36:33.936 A:middle
&gt;&gt; JULIEN ROBERT: And
I will call Bruce back

00:36:34.236 --> 00:36:35.416 A:middle
to conclude this presentation.

00:36:39.576 --> 00:36:40.926 A:middle
&gt;&gt; BRUCE STADNYK: Thank
you, Dave and Julien

00:36:40.926 --> 00:36:44.626 A:middle
for showing us how to
use contacts in our apps.

00:36:45.676 --> 00:36:49.396 A:middle
So you now have an Objective-C
API to access contacts,

00:36:49.856 --> 00:36:53.406 A:middle
and it works well with Swift.

00:36:54.056 --> 00:36:58.116 A:middle
The Contacts API is the same
across multiple Apple platforms.

00:36:58.916 --> 00:37:01.976 A:middle
Address book is being
