00:00:19.056 --> 00:00:20.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TODD FERNANDEZ: Good morning
and welcome to session 301.

00:00:21.316 --> 00:00:24.376 A:middle
I'm Todd Fernandez, and I manage
Apple's device management tools

00:00:24.376 --> 00:00:27.246 A:middle
engineering teams and help
coordinate our efforts

00:00:27.276 --> 00:00:29.416 A:middle
across the company
to support deploying

00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:30.766 A:middle
and managing Apple devices.

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:33.296 A:middle
I'm excited to be here
with you this morning

00:00:33.496 --> 00:00:36.306 A:middle
to represent the many teams
across Apple that have been hard

00:00:36.306 --> 00:00:39.586 A:middle
at work since we last met
and introduce what's new

00:00:39.586 --> 00:00:40.886 A:middle
in managing Apple devices.

00:00:43.406 --> 00:00:46.316 A:middle
Apple's commitment to education
and enterprise goes back

00:00:46.316 --> 00:00:47.546 A:middle
to the beginning of the company.

00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:49.696 A:middle
Serving the needs of educators

00:00:49.696 --> 00:00:51.456 A:middle
and students has been
an important part

00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:53.176 A:middle
of Apple throughout its history.

00:00:54.886 --> 00:00:58.156 A:middle
Today, there's a whole new world
of devices and content available

00:00:58.156 --> 00:00:59.326 A:middle
to teachers and students.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:00.176 --> 00:01:03.136 A:middle
Technology can now be completely
integrated, both inside

00:01:04.176 --> 00:01:05.626 A:middle
and outside of the classroom.

00:01:07.336 --> 00:01:10.106 A:middle
But those devices and content
are also critically important

00:01:10.106 --> 00:01:10.916 A:middle
in the enterprise.

00:01:11.456 --> 00:01:12.536 A:middle
Though Apple's success

00:01:12.536 --> 00:01:15.456 A:middle
in the enterprise today
dwarfs any past successes,

00:01:16.086 --> 00:01:18.646 A:middle
Apple's interest in fostering
increased productivity

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:21.756 A:middle
and enterprise started a long
time ago with the VisiCalc

00:01:21.756 --> 00:01:24.436 A:middle
on the Apple II and
continues through the myriad

00:01:24.436 --> 00:01:27.836 A:middle
of solutions now based on
iPhones, iPads, and Macs.

00:01:28.396 --> 00:01:31.206 A:middle
From the factory
floor to the office.

00:01:32.516 --> 00:01:34.746 A:middle
So how can we make it
even easier for schools

00:01:34.746 --> 00:01:37.256 A:middle
and businesses to take full
advantage of everything

00:01:37.256 --> 00:01:38.856 A:middle
that the Apple ecosystem offers?

00:01:39.816 --> 00:01:44.596 A:middle
Since the introduction of iPhone
and accelerating with iPad,

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:47.766 A:middle
Apple has created key
technologies and services

00:01:48.286 --> 00:01:49.876 A:middle
to enable schools and businesses

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:51.146 A:middle
to make the most
of their devices.

00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:54.486 A:middle
This year we are building
on that foundation

00:01:55.106 --> 00:01:57.976 A:middle
with a special emphasis on
shared device deployments.

00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:01.296 A:middle
Now, I need to take a moment
for a brief aside here.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:01.296 A:middle
Now, I need to take a moment
for a brief aside here.

00:02:01.506 --> 00:02:03.676 A:middle
I likely will be referring
to these two programs

00:02:03.716 --> 00:02:06.496 A:middle
by their three-letter
acronyms, DEP and VPP,

00:02:06.496 --> 00:02:07.636 A:middle
throughout this presentation,

00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:11.406 A:middle
but I owe marketing a dollar
every time I call a Device

00:02:11.406 --> 00:02:15.686 A:middle
Enrollment Program a dep. If
I slip, don't give me away.

00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:17.386 A:middle
I appreciate it.

00:02:18.356 --> 00:02:20.526 A:middle
All these device management
features really boil

00:02:20.526 --> 00:02:24.056 A:middle
down to helping you spend less
time with your devices looking

00:02:24.056 --> 00:02:27.646 A:middle
like this and more
time with your students

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:30.686 A:middle
and employees using them
to do things like this.

00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:35.316 A:middle
Now, today we are going to cover
the entire deployment process,

00:02:35.506 --> 00:02:38.226 A:middle
highlighting all the new
features in both OSs,

00:02:39.396 --> 00:02:41.556 A:middle
the services and
tools along the way.

00:02:43.016 --> 00:02:46.366 A:middle
The first step is to enroll your
devices for remote management.

00:02:46.716 --> 00:02:49.416 A:middle
Of course, the best way
to do that is using DEP,

00:02:49.416 --> 00:02:51.126 A:middle
the Device Enrollment Program.

00:02:52.096 --> 00:02:53.886 A:middle
Before we jump into the
new features, though,

00:02:54.116 --> 00:02:56.686 A:middle
I want to take a moment
to highlight two changes

00:02:56.686 --> 00:02:58.026 A:middle
that have already taken place.

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:01.136 A:middle
The first is that we've expanded

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:01.136 A:middle
The first is that we've expanded

00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:03.796 A:middle
from our initial
launch in two countries.

00:03:04.616 --> 00:03:07.556 A:middle
The program is now available in
26 countries around the world.

00:03:08.846 --> 00:03:11.506 A:middle
And we've dramatically
shortened the time it takes

00:03:11.686 --> 00:03:14.566 A:middle
to get replacement
devices into the program.

00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:18.006 A:middle
So that's great.

00:03:18.126 --> 00:03:20.386 A:middle
Now let's talk about what
is new and coming this year.

00:03:21.716 --> 00:03:23.086 A:middle
The first feature I want to talk

00:03:23.086 --> 00:03:25.956 A:middle
about is called Enrollment
Optimization.

00:03:26.086 --> 00:03:28.126 A:middle
You might be thinking,
what does that mean?

00:03:28.126 --> 00:03:29.296 A:middle
It's actually very simple.

00:03:29.956 --> 00:03:32.726 A:middle
This is a way for the MDM
server managing the device

00:03:33.326 --> 00:03:35.156 A:middle
to keep the device
in Setup Assistant

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:36.486 A:middle
until it is fully configured.

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:40.476 A:middle
This ensures that before
a user can use the device,

00:03:40.726 --> 00:03:42.736 A:middle
all the settings,
accounts, and restrictions

00:03:42.736 --> 00:03:44.136 A:middle
that the organization
wants to have

00:03:44.136 --> 00:03:46.356 A:middle
in place are actually in place.

00:03:47.006 --> 00:03:49.976 A:middle
So how does it work?

00:03:50.176 --> 00:03:53.106 A:middle
There's a new key that is
part of the DEP settings

00:03:53.636 --> 00:03:56.176 A:middle
that specifies that you
want the device to wait

00:03:56.176 --> 00:03:57.226 A:middle
until it's fully configured.

00:03:58.346 --> 00:04:01.976 A:middle
When the device obtains its
Device Enrollment Program

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.346 --> 00:04:01.976 A:middle
When the device obtains its
Device Enrollment Program

00:04:01.976 --> 00:04:05.436 A:middle
settings from the service,
when it is enrolling

00:04:05.436 --> 00:04:08.366 A:middle
with the MDM server, it passes
that state back to the server.

00:04:08.866 --> 00:04:12.406 A:middle
The server then knows it can
take as many MDM commands

00:04:12.406 --> 00:04:14.256 A:middle
and install as many
configuration profiles

00:04:14.256 --> 00:04:17.036 A:middle
as necessary to fully
configure that device.

00:04:18.176 --> 00:04:19.646 A:middle
Once the device is
fully configured,

00:04:20.346 --> 00:04:22.796 A:middle
the server sends a New
Device Configured command

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:25.496 A:middle
to the device, allowing
it to exit Setup Assistant

00:04:25.686 --> 00:04:27.486 A:middle
and be used by the end user.

00:04:28.046 --> 00:04:33.886 A:middle
This is available in both
iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan.

00:04:34.386 --> 00:04:37.176 A:middle
Next I want to talk about
a feature specific to OS X

00:04:38.216 --> 00:04:41.336 A:middle
that gives you more control
over how accounts are created,

00:04:41.336 --> 00:04:44.376 A:middle
or not created as the case
may be, during enrollment.

00:04:45.016 --> 00:04:49.546 A:middle
In fact, you can now prevent
user creation entirely

00:04:49.546 --> 00:04:53.096 A:middle
if you just want to use
network accounts on your Macs.

00:04:53.096 --> 00:04:55.356 A:middle
This works great with
Enrollment Optimization

00:04:55.676 --> 00:04:57.306 A:middle
if you set a passcode policy.

00:04:57.836 --> 00:04:59.186 A:middle
That policy will be enforced

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:00.796 A:middle
when the user is creating
their new account.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:00.796 A:middle
when the user is creating
their new account.

00:05:02.136 --> 00:05:05.746 A:middle
One of the most important
changes is that now instead

00:05:05.746 --> 00:05:09.806 A:middle
of the user creating an admin
account during DEP enrollment,

00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:12.316 A:middle
you can specify that that
account will be a standard

00:05:12.316 --> 00:05:14.816 A:middle
account, which is typically
what you want in education.

00:05:15.266 --> 00:05:18.266 A:middle
However, because
OS X, of course,

00:05:18.326 --> 00:05:22.096 A:middle
requires an admin account to be
on the system, if you specify

00:05:22.096 --> 00:05:23.616 A:middle
that the standard
account will be created,

00:05:23.616 --> 00:05:27.026 A:middle
you can also create an admin
account behind the scenes

00:05:27.506 --> 00:05:28.296 A:middle
that you can later use

00:05:28.296 --> 00:05:30.596 A:middle
for remote management
via ARD or other tools.

00:05:31.296 --> 00:05:33.726 A:middle
And you can optionally
hide that admin account

00:05:33.726 --> 00:05:35.516 A:middle
from any standard
users on the system.

00:05:36.316 --> 00:05:39.016 A:middle
All these settings can be
configured using a new MDM

00:05:39.016 --> 00:05:41.956 A:middle
command called Setup
Configuration, which works well

00:05:41.956 --> 00:05:45.316 A:middle
in conjunction with Enrollment
Optimization [applause].

00:05:47.066 --> 00:05:47.426 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TODD FERNANDEZ:
This is great.

00:05:47.426 --> 00:05:49.846 A:middle
It will be very key in
education in particular.

00:05:50.156 --> 00:05:53.866 A:middle
Now let's turn to iOS 9
and to a feature again

00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:56.196 A:middle
with a somewhat ambiguous
name, but I'll explain.

00:05:56.656 --> 00:05:58.016 A:middle
Also very simple to explain.

00:05:58.826 --> 00:06:01.536 A:middle
Automated Enrollment is a
way to enroll your devices

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.826 --> 00:06:01.536 A:middle
Automated Enrollment is a
way to enroll your devices

00:06:01.656 --> 00:06:03.916 A:middle
in MDM using the Device
Enrollment Program

00:06:04.036 --> 00:06:07.416 A:middle
without anyone tapping
on the device.

00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:10.256 A:middle
How does it work?

00:06:10.476 --> 00:06:13.446 A:middle
Well, the first step is you
configure your DEP settings

00:06:13.446 --> 00:06:14.276 A:middle
like you would today,

00:06:15.066 --> 00:06:17.826 A:middle
but instead of having a
user get the device and walk

00:06:17.826 --> 00:06:21.166 A:middle
through the Setup Assistant,
you will connect the device

00:06:21.166 --> 00:06:23.756 A:middle
to Apple Configurator,
which will tell the device

00:06:24.216 --> 00:06:26.396 A:middle
"configure yourself
using your DEP settings."

00:06:27.456 --> 00:06:29.146 A:middle
The device obtains
those settings

00:06:30.076 --> 00:06:32.786 A:middle
and fully configures itself
all the way to the Home screen.

00:06:32.856 --> 00:06:34.376 A:middle
It's ready for the user to use

00:06:34.646 --> 00:06:36.216 A:middle
without anyone touching
the device.

00:06:37.176 --> 00:06:39.246 A:middle
This is a great feature
for shared deployments

00:06:39.246 --> 00:06:42.846 A:middle
in particular, enabling you
to configure a cart of iPads

00:06:42.846 --> 00:06:45.516 A:middle
without touching them beyond
connecting the USB cable.

00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:52.166 A:middle
This is not a new
feature per se,

00:06:52.426 --> 00:06:55.096 A:middle
but we've expanded the number
of Setup Assistant panes

00:06:55.096 --> 00:06:57.306 A:middle
that you can choose
to skip as part

00:06:57.306 --> 00:06:59.106 A:middle
of your Device Enrollment
Program settings.

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:01.836 A:middle
Over the past year, we
rolled out these three panes,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:01.836 A:middle
Over the past year, we
rolled out these three panes,

00:07:02.326 --> 00:07:06.476 A:middle
but in iOS 9 you can also remove
the new Move From Android option

00:07:06.546 --> 00:07:09.106 A:middle
on the setup pane if
your enterprise wants

00:07:09.106 --> 00:07:11.016 A:middle
to make sure there's no
corporate data leaking

00:07:11.016 --> 00:07:13.906 A:middle
from their Android devices
while they're transitioning

00:07:13.906 --> 00:07:14.946 A:middle
to an iOS device.

00:07:15.856 --> 00:07:16.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TODD FERNANDEZ:
Finally I would

00:07:16.516 --> 00:07:19.726 A:middle
like to highlight something
I mentioned last year, that,

00:07:21.586 --> 00:07:24.066 A:middle
analogous to what the
MDM server can obtain

00:07:24.066 --> 00:07:26.166 A:middle
from the iTunes Store,
to get the Store Bag,

00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:29.086 A:middle
which tells you all the
APIs and URLs you can use

00:07:29.146 --> 00:07:32.846 A:middle
to control the VPP
program and other tasks,

00:07:33.996 --> 00:07:36.896 A:middle
MDM servers can implement
what we call MDMServiceConfig,

00:07:37.586 --> 00:07:40.146 A:middle
which will tell other device
management tools, for example,

00:07:40.146 --> 00:07:43.586 A:middle
Configurator, what kinds
of services it provides,

00:07:43.906 --> 00:07:46.786 A:middle
the most important being
the DEP enrollment URL.

00:07:47.716 --> 00:07:48.646 A:middle
Why is that important?

00:07:48.646 --> 00:07:50.926 A:middle
In fact, the Profile
Manager version

00:07:50.926 --> 00:07:53.926 A:middle
that we seeded this
week supports this,

00:07:54.316 --> 00:07:56.756 A:middle
and Apple Configurator we
seeded this week supports it.

00:07:57.226 --> 00:07:59.866 A:middle
And enables Configurator user,
instead of having to type

00:07:59.866 --> 00:08:03.256 A:middle
in the entire URL, can
just type in the host name

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:59.866 --> 00:08:03.256 A:middle
in the entire URL, can
just type in the host name

00:08:03.256 --> 00:08:06.236 A:middle
of the MDM server and
obtain the URL for the user.

00:08:06.826 --> 00:08:10.476 A:middle
So that brings us to the end
of the enrollment section.

00:08:10.476 --> 00:08:12.156 A:middle
We now have our devices
enrolled, they're ready

00:08:12.156 --> 00:08:13.026 A:middle
for remote management.

00:08:13.706 --> 00:08:16.806 A:middle
The next thing we want to
do is deploy the great apps

00:08:17.326 --> 00:08:19.056 A:middle
from the App Store
and other sources.

00:08:20.206 --> 00:08:23.006 A:middle
Of course, there are,
what did we say yesterday?

00:08:23.006 --> 00:08:24.576 A:middle
A million and a half
apps in the App Store.

00:08:25.196 --> 00:08:28.076 A:middle
There are also a large number
of B2B apps in the App Store.

00:08:28.906 --> 00:08:30.506 A:middle
There are in-house
enterprise apps

00:08:30.506 --> 00:08:32.135 A:middle
that your organizations
may be creating,

00:08:32.756 --> 00:08:35.996 A:middle
and developers may be using
ad hoc apps to distribute,

00:08:35.996 --> 00:08:37.535 A:middle
for beta testing
or other purposes,

00:08:37.606 --> 00:08:38.946 A:middle
using provisioning profiles.

00:08:39.846 --> 00:08:42.785 A:middle
I will talk primarily today
about the first three,

00:08:43.145 --> 00:08:44.746 A:middle
but there is something
towards the end

00:08:44.746 --> 00:08:47.016 A:middle
of the presentation also
potentially relevant

00:08:47.016 --> 00:08:48.206 A:middle
for that fourth type.

00:08:48.816 --> 00:08:51.616 A:middle
There are many different ways
to distribute apps to users,

00:08:52.106 --> 00:08:55.736 A:middle
but today I'm going to
primarily focus on Apple's tools

00:08:55.786 --> 00:08:57.066 A:middle
as well as MDM in general.

00:08:57.516 --> 00:09:01.286 A:middle
Finally, there are three
different ways to purchase apps.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:57.516 --> 00:09:01.286 A:middle
Finally, there are three
different ways to purchase apps.

00:09:02.016 --> 00:09:03.366 A:middle
Your users, of course,
can just go

00:09:03.366 --> 00:09:04.426 A:middle
to the App Store and buy them.

00:09:05.686 --> 00:09:07.326 A:middle
We have VPP redemption codes,

00:09:07.456 --> 00:09:09.306 A:middle
which transfer ownership
to the user.

00:09:10.146 --> 00:09:11.446 A:middle
Finally two years ago,

00:09:11.446 --> 00:09:13.546 A:middle
we introduced VPP
managed distribution

00:09:13.596 --> 00:09:17.086 A:middle
to give organizations greater
control and preserve ownership

00:09:17.086 --> 00:09:20.336 A:middle
of the apps they buy under
the Volume Purchase Program.

00:09:21.126 --> 00:09:24.126 A:middle
That's what I want to spend
our time right now on.

00:09:24.746 --> 00:09:28.966 A:middle
There are three big new changes
that I want to highlight today,

00:09:28.966 --> 00:09:30.626 A:middle
each one larger than the last.

00:09:31.316 --> 00:09:35.156 A:middle
The first is similar to the
Device Enrollment Program.

00:09:35.246 --> 00:09:37.476 A:middle
Over the past year we
expanded from 10 countries

00:09:37.596 --> 00:09:39.226 A:middle
to the same 26 countries

00:09:39.306 --> 00:09:41.176 A:middle
where the Device Enrollment
Program is available.

00:09:41.796 --> 00:09:42.746 A:middle
That's great.

00:09:43.386 --> 00:09:44.316 A:middle
But the second item I want

00:09:44.316 --> 00:09:47.746 A:middle
to mention is bigger
and builds on this.

00:09:47.746 --> 00:09:50.176 A:middle
We now have multinational
app assignment as part

00:09:50.176 --> 00:09:51.636 A:middle
of VPP managed distribution.

00:09:52.006 --> 00:09:52.936 A:middle
What does that mean [applause]?

00:09:54.406 --> 00:09:56.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TODD FERNANDEZ:
Maybe you know already!

00:09:56.826 --> 00:09:58.376 A:middle
We can go right through
this slide quickly.

00:09:58.946 --> 00:10:02.236 A:middle
What that means is you can
purchase your VPP apps in any

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:58.946 --> 00:10:02.236 A:middle
What that means is you can
purchase your VPP apps in any

00:10:02.236 --> 00:10:06.346 A:middle
of those 26 countries, but
distribute them to any country

00:10:06.346 --> 00:10:07.836 A:middle
where that app is
in the App Store.

00:10:08.326 --> 00:10:09.606 A:middle
So to make it concrete,

00:10:09.716 --> 00:10:12.206 A:middle
if you are a multinational
company headquartered in France,

00:10:12.506 --> 00:10:15.216 A:middle
you can buy all your apps in
France but distribute them

00:10:15.216 --> 00:10:18.016 A:middle
to your users in the U.S.,
Canada, or even Kenya,

00:10:18.016 --> 00:10:20.356 A:middle
as long as that app is in
the App Store in Kenya.

00:10:21.536 --> 00:10:22.826 A:middle
We think this is
going to be huge.

00:10:23.226 --> 00:10:26.626 A:middle
Believe it or not, the next
one is even bigger than this.

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:30.366 A:middle
You can now assign your VPP mass
distribution apps to devices.

00:10:31.516 --> 00:10:35.606 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:36.106 --> 00:10:36.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TODD FERNANDEZ: Thank you.

00:10:36.666 --> 00:10:37.506 A:middle
We appreciate that.

00:10:38.046 --> 00:10:40.476 A:middle
So previously you could
assign them to users,

00:10:40.476 --> 00:10:42.556 A:middle
and iTunes Store Apple ID.

00:10:43.016 --> 00:10:44.986 A:middle
What is different about
device assignments?

00:10:45.786 --> 00:10:48.156 A:middle
Now there is no invitation
process if you want

00:10:48.156 --> 00:10:49.276 A:middle
to use device assignments

00:10:49.426 --> 00:10:51.866 A:middle
because there's no Apple ID
required on the device in order

00:10:51.866 --> 00:10:55.936 A:middle
to distribute the apps,
install them, and run.

00:10:56.136 --> 00:10:59.716 A:middle
Even if there is an iTunes Apple
ID configured on the device,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:00.196 --> 00:11:02.316 A:middle
these apps will not appear in
the user's purchase history

00:11:02.316 --> 00:11:04.136 A:middle
because they are not
assigned to that user.

00:11:04.976 --> 00:11:08.346 A:middle
That further means there is
no way for the user to manage

00:11:08.346 --> 00:11:12.196 A:middle
that app, or install it, or
update it in the device UI.

00:11:12.196 --> 00:11:14.636 A:middle
It's completely at the
discretion of the administrator

00:11:14.636 --> 00:11:16.806 A:middle
and the MDM server to
control that timing.

00:11:17.386 --> 00:11:20.176 A:middle
A final difference I want
to highlight is that,

00:11:20.176 --> 00:11:23.286 A:middle
in contrast to user assignments,
where that app can be installed

00:11:23.286 --> 00:11:26.526 A:middle
on any device where that iTunes
Store Apple ID is configured,

00:11:26.526 --> 00:11:29.096 A:middle
if you are using device
assignments you need

00:11:29.096 --> 00:11:32.766 A:middle
to purchase a copy for each
device, and you app developers

00:11:32.766 --> 00:11:34.276 A:middle
out there should be
happy about that.

00:11:34.436 --> 00:11:35.186 A:middle
More sales!

00:11:36.896 --> 00:11:40.096 A:middle
But I also want to repeat,
there is no Apple ID required

00:11:40.096 --> 00:11:41.936 A:middle
on the device in
order to install apps.

00:11:42.516 --> 00:11:48.056 A:middle
[ Cheers &amp; Applause ]

00:11:48.556 --> 00:11:49.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TODD FERNANDEZ:
Another big step forward

00:11:49.956 --> 00:11:52.156 A:middle
to make shared device
deployments much easier.

00:11:54.236 --> 00:11:55.856 A:middle
So what has remained the same?

00:11:56.636 --> 00:11:58.846 A:middle
The purchasing experience
is exactly the same.

00:11:59.376 --> 00:12:03.066 A:middle
You purchase VPP managed
distribution licenses

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.376 --> 00:12:03.066 A:middle
You purchase VPP managed
distribution licenses

00:12:03.066 --> 00:12:08.106 A:middle
on the VPP store, and they can
be freely reassigned to a user

00:12:08.106 --> 00:12:10.706 A:middle
or a device and later
revoked and assigned

00:12:10.706 --> 00:12:11.996 A:middle
to a different user or device.

00:12:13.056 --> 00:12:14.376 A:middle
We've also worked very hard

00:12:14.376 --> 00:12:17.306 A:middle
to make sure there's a smooth
transition for all of the apps

00:12:17.306 --> 00:12:20.196 A:middle
that have already been installed
based on user assignments.

00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:24.346 A:middle
If you wish, you can transfer
and transition that assignment

00:12:24.346 --> 00:12:27.366 A:middle
to a device assignment without
having to reinstall the app

00:12:27.546 --> 00:12:28.966 A:middle
or risk losing user data.

00:12:29.346 --> 00:12:31.706 A:middle
The app stays in place,
as does the user data.

00:12:32.516 --> 00:12:38.686 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:39.186 --> 00:12:40.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TODD FERNANDEZ: So what does
this mean for app developers?

00:12:41.726 --> 00:12:42.826 A:middle
It is actually pretty simple.

00:12:43.266 --> 00:12:46.416 A:middle
First of all, early next month,
iTunes Connect will allow you

00:12:46.416 --> 00:12:49.566 A:middle
to opt in to allow your
app to be distributed

00:12:49.566 --> 00:12:50.626 A:middle
as a device assignment.

00:12:52.046 --> 00:12:53.166 A:middle
This is probably a good idea.

00:12:53.166 --> 00:12:56.246 A:middle
Remember that piece I mentioned,
you might sell more copies?

00:12:57.146 --> 00:13:00.486 A:middle
Also, if your app is
checking the receipt to ensure

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:57.146 --> 00:13:00.486 A:middle
Also, if your app is
checking the receipt to ensure

00:13:00.486 --> 00:13:04.486 A:middle
that it is running on a device
where a user is configured

00:13:04.486 --> 00:13:06.296 A:middle
that is the same user
the app is assigned to,

00:13:06.686 --> 00:13:08.586 A:middle
you'll want to update
that checking to do

00:13:08.586 --> 00:13:10.386 A:middle
that to make sure it's
running on the device

00:13:10.426 --> 00:13:12.836 A:middle
that it's been assigned to.

00:13:12.996 --> 00:13:14.376 A:middle
Secondly, I want to make a pitch

00:13:14.376 --> 00:13:16.836 A:middle
that device assignments
are a great feature

00:13:16.836 --> 00:13:19.506 A:middle
for shared device
deployments, but another one

00:13:19.506 --> 00:13:22.466 A:middle
for you app developers is to
move, if you haven't already,

00:13:22.746 --> 00:13:25.066 A:middle
to store your app's data
and settings in the cloud,

00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:27.456 A:middle
whether it's Apple's
cloud with iCloud Drive

00:13:27.456 --> 00:13:29.166 A:middle
if you're document-based,
or CloudKit,

00:13:29.646 --> 00:13:31.116 A:middle
or your own cloud-based storage.

00:13:32.436 --> 00:13:35.936 A:middle
This will help your app fit in
better in shared deployments.

00:13:36.446 --> 00:13:39.266 A:middle
There are a number of sessions
this week that will show you how

00:13:39.266 --> 00:13:40.856 A:middle
to do that with our
own solutions.

00:13:41.376 --> 00:13:42.666 A:middle
I encourage you to
check those out.

00:13:42.666 --> 00:13:46.866 A:middle
I also want to highlight
a change

00:13:46.866 --> 00:13:49.366 A:middle
to the caching server
feature of OS X server,

00:13:49.516 --> 00:13:55.886 A:middle
which already caches
OS updates and apps.

00:13:56.546 --> 00:14:01.666 A:middle
It now caches also iCloud data,
including Drive documents,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:56.546 --> 00:14:01.666 A:middle
It now caches also iCloud data,
including Drive documents,

00:14:01.816 --> 00:14:04.366 A:middle
CloudKit data, and iCloud
photo library photos.

00:14:04.366 --> 00:14:07.456 A:middle
And those of you who have
now heard about App Thinning

00:14:07.456 --> 00:14:10.196 A:middle
and on-demand resources, it
will also cache those as well.

00:14:11.416 --> 00:14:13.816 A:middle
It just preheats the cache
of cloud data on your network

00:14:13.816 --> 00:14:16.056 A:middle
to give you better performance
and reduce your bandwidth,

00:14:16.696 --> 00:14:18.566 A:middle
and of course all of the data

00:14:18.696 --> 00:14:21.596 A:middle
in the cache is encrypted
using keys only present

00:14:21.596 --> 00:14:22.786 A:middle
on the client device.

00:14:23.346 --> 00:14:28.116 A:middle
So turning to what this
means for MDM developers,

00:14:28.986 --> 00:14:31.986 A:middle
if you are supporting VPP
managed distribution already,

00:14:32.536 --> 00:14:34.406 A:middle
there are a few changes
to the iTunes Store APIs,

00:14:34.706 --> 00:14:36.046 A:middle
which I'll cover in a moment.

00:14:37.096 --> 00:14:39.236 A:middle
You will use the same
Install Application command

00:14:39.236 --> 00:14:42.166 A:middle
to the device to tell
it to install this app.

00:14:42.956 --> 00:14:45.686 A:middle
You obviously should now
support assigning apps

00:14:45.686 --> 00:14:47.046 A:middle
to devices and device groups.

00:14:47.776 --> 00:14:50.066 A:middle
We've built all of
this to make it easier

00:14:50.066 --> 00:14:52.506 A:middle
to centralize the app's
management workflows.

00:14:52.506 --> 00:14:54.906 A:middle
It will be much more reliable
with device assignments

00:14:54.906 --> 00:14:58.636 A:middle
to be able if you wish to unify
the assignment in the Store

00:14:58.676 --> 00:15:00.306 A:middle
with the installation
command to the device.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:58.676 --> 00:15:00.306 A:middle
with the installation
command to the device.

00:15:00.306 --> 00:15:06.386 A:middle
So what are the changes for the
Install Application command?

00:15:07.426 --> 00:15:10.026 A:middle
Well, if the app is not
installed, it will install it.

00:15:11.016 --> 00:15:13.386 A:middle
If it already has been
installed by the MDM server

00:15:13.476 --> 00:15:15.116 A:middle
and is managed, it
will update it.

00:15:16.046 --> 00:15:18.086 A:middle
If the user already
installed the app so it's

00:15:18.476 --> 00:15:21.396 A:middle
in an unmanaged state, the
installation will fail,

00:15:21.606 --> 00:15:23.316 A:middle
so your server will
need to handle that case

00:15:23.316 --> 00:15:24.406 A:middle
and respond appropriately.

00:15:25.826 --> 00:15:28.696 A:middle
For those of you who are already
supporting this for OS X,

00:15:28.696 --> 00:15:31.796 A:middle
hopefully all of you, for
device assignments you want

00:15:31.846 --> 00:15:34.446 A:middle
to use the same purchase method
you have been using on OS X,

00:15:34.656 --> 00:15:37.406 A:middle
purchase method one for
iOS device assignments.

00:15:38.886 --> 00:15:40.146 A:middle
That's the command
to the device.

00:15:40.146 --> 00:15:42.416 A:middle
Now let's turn to the
command for the iTunes Store

00:15:42.416 --> 00:15:46.146 A:middle
to update its records on which
app is assigned to which device.

00:15:47.556 --> 00:15:50.856 A:middle
There are two new APIs that
should make implementing support

00:15:50.856 --> 00:15:53.126 A:middle
for VPP managed distribution
much easier.

00:15:53.806 --> 00:15:59.216 A:middle
The first supersedes the
separate commands to associate

00:15:59.216 --> 00:16:01.246 A:middle
and disassociate
licenses with users.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:59.216 --> 00:16:01.246 A:middle
and disassociate
licenses with users.

00:16:01.866 --> 00:16:05.596 A:middle
And it allows you to, with
one call for a single app,

00:16:06.266 --> 00:16:09.846 A:middle
to associate with any
number of users or devices

00:16:09.846 --> 00:16:12.106 A:middle
and disassociate any
number of users or devices.

00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:13.896 A:middle
This will make it
very easy to implement

00:16:13.896 --> 00:16:15.726 A:middle
that smooth migration
I mentioned earlier.

00:16:17.096 --> 00:16:21.956 A:middle
The second API gives you
an easy way to get the list

00:16:21.956 --> 00:16:24.946 A:middle
of apps the organization has
purchased, including the number

00:16:24.946 --> 00:16:26.906 A:middle
of licenses of each app
that they have purchased

00:16:26.906 --> 00:16:28.586 A:middle
without having to
fetch the entire list

00:16:28.586 --> 00:16:30.446 A:middle
of every single license
they purchased.

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:35.056 A:middle
This will make it much easier to
build a responsive app library

00:16:35.056 --> 00:16:36.036 A:middle
in your admin console.

00:16:36.036 --> 00:16:41.116 A:middle
Moving on to an existing API

00:16:41.116 --> 00:16:43.296 A:middle
that has gotten several
new fields.

00:16:44.756 --> 00:16:48.126 A:middle
There are max limits for
the number of licenses

00:16:48.126 --> 00:16:52.206 A:middle
that manage VPP licenses,
API just mentioned.

00:16:52.996 --> 00:16:55.666 A:middle
You want to respect these values
when you're calling that API

00:16:56.726 --> 00:16:58.586 A:middle
to not call with
more than that number

00:16:58.586 --> 00:17:01.766 A:middle
of licenses in a single call.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:58.586 --> 00:17:01.766 A:middle
of licenses in a single call.

00:17:01.976 --> 00:17:05.415 A:middle
We also have added a new
Retry After header because,

00:17:05.606 --> 00:17:06.965 A:middle
how can I say this delicately?

00:17:06.965 --> 00:17:07.506 A:middle
I'll be blunt.

00:17:08.346 --> 00:17:12.526 A:middle
Some of you, and we know who
you are, have some MDM solutions

00:17:12.526 --> 00:17:15.566 A:middle
that let's just say they
send a few too many requests

00:17:15.566 --> 00:17:16.465 A:middle
to the iTunes store.

00:17:17.486 --> 00:17:21.596 A:middle
We need you to fix that but
also respect this header

00:17:22.066 --> 00:17:24.955 A:middle
because if your solution
continues to do that,

00:17:24.955 --> 00:17:29.006 A:middle
we will send this header and
we may, if you ignore it,

00:17:29.696 --> 00:17:32.536 A:middle
create longer delays in
rejecting your commands

00:17:32.536 --> 00:17:35.566 A:middle
and potentially even suspend
the account of your customer.

00:17:36.826 --> 00:17:39.256 A:middle
So please, adopt this.

00:17:39.256 --> 00:17:41.416 A:middle
All right.

00:17:41.906 --> 00:17:44.646 A:middle
So moving away from strictly
VPP managed distribution

00:17:44.646 --> 00:17:46.936 A:middle
to some more general
app distribution topics.

00:17:47.646 --> 00:17:48.796 A:middle
There are a few things
that are new.

00:17:48.796 --> 00:17:51.086 A:middle
Really, they are
just more convenient.

00:17:51.646 --> 00:17:54.626 A:middle
The first is reiterating
the point I made earlier

00:17:54.626 --> 00:17:57.436 A:middle
that we've made a very
smooth migration from user

00:17:57.436 --> 00:18:00.186 A:middle
to device assignments to leave
the app and data in place.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:57.436 --> 00:18:00.186 A:middle
to device assignments to leave
the app and data in place.

00:18:01.066 --> 00:18:04.906 A:middle
Secondly, if the app has
already been installed unmanaged

00:18:04.906 --> 00:18:07.696 A:middle
by the user, it is now
possible to convert that app

00:18:07.696 --> 00:18:09.926 A:middle
to managed state without
having to reinstall

00:18:09.926 --> 00:18:10.866 A:middle
or lose user data [applause].

00:18:15.046 --> 00:18:16.696 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TODD FERNANDEZ: I'll give
you the details in a moment,

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:21.356 A:middle
but the third change is that
you can now install apps via MDM

00:18:21.356 --> 00:18:23.806 A:middle
or Configurator even if
you disabled the App Store.

00:18:24.856 --> 00:18:27.856 A:middle
Great improvement for
education in particular.

00:18:29.016 --> 00:18:29.876 A:middle
How does this work?

00:18:31.196 --> 00:18:34.366 A:middle
Changing an app from unmanaged
state to managed state is

00:18:34.366 --> 00:18:37.016 A:middle
as simple as sending a new
Install Application command,

00:18:37.226 --> 00:18:40.036 A:middle
with this new field, Change
Management State equals Managed.

00:18:40.386 --> 00:18:44.006 A:middle
And this will happen silently
on a supervised device.

00:18:44.006 --> 00:18:44.826 A:middle
That's it.

00:18:45.496 --> 00:18:48.436 A:middle
If it's an unsupervised
device, you can use this,

00:18:48.566 --> 00:18:50.736 A:middle
but the user will be
prompted to accept the change.

00:18:52.126 --> 00:18:55.016 A:middle
Once that change has happened,
managed open in will consider

00:18:55.016 --> 00:18:57.096 A:middle
that app to be managed and
all of that data will be

00:18:57.096 --> 00:19:00.626 A:middle
within the managed sphere,
just as if it had always been.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:57.096 --> 00:19:00.626 A:middle
within the managed sphere,
just as if it had always been.

00:19:01.416 --> 00:19:03.126 A:middle
If the app is not
installed at all,

00:19:03.126 --> 00:19:04.236 A:middle
and you're passing this call,

00:19:04.236 --> 00:19:06.296 A:middle
it will still install
the app as a managed app.

00:19:08.506 --> 00:19:09.766 A:middle
That's great.

00:19:10.096 --> 00:19:14.136 A:middle
This works for App Store apps,
all the different types of apps.

00:19:14.176 --> 00:19:17.796 A:middle
Let's talk about changes
for enterprise apps.

00:19:17.796 --> 00:19:21.406 A:middle
We've created in iOS 9 a new
UI flow to make it easier

00:19:21.406 --> 00:19:22.876 A:middle
for the user to understand

00:19:22.876 --> 00:19:24.776 A:middle
when they are installing
an enterprise app

00:19:24.776 --> 00:19:25.956 A:middle
from a new developer.

00:19:26.636 --> 00:19:28.556 A:middle
I'll show you what
that looks like.

00:19:29.556 --> 00:19:31.906 A:middle
We also made it easier for
you to avoid your users

00:19:31.906 --> 00:19:35.046 A:middle
from ever having to see that
great new user experience

00:19:35.496 --> 00:19:37.976 A:middle
because you can prevent
them from trusting new apps

00:19:38.086 --> 00:19:41.556 A:middle
from other developers so that
they can only use your in-house

00:19:41.556 --> 00:19:43.386 A:middle
enterprise apps.

00:19:43.386 --> 00:19:45.536 A:middle
And if they have enrolled
with your MDM server,

00:19:45.926 --> 00:19:49.766 A:middle
they have implicitly given their
trust to you as a developer,

00:19:49.766 --> 00:19:52.926 A:middle
and so any apps that
you install the MDM

00:19:52.926 --> 00:19:55.276 A:middle
that are your enterprise
in-house apps will be

00:19:55.276 --> 00:19:56.106 A:middle
installed silently.

00:19:57.516 --> 00:20:01.576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:57.516 --> 00:20:01.576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:02.076 --> 00:20:03.726 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TODD FERNANDEZ: So if
it is an enterprise app

00:20:03.726 --> 00:20:05.546 A:middle
from a developer that
they haven't trusted yet,

00:20:05.546 --> 00:20:06.476 A:middle
what does that look like?

00:20:07.876 --> 00:20:09.036 A:middle
Well, it looks like this.

00:20:09.076 --> 00:20:13.766 A:middle
After they installed the app
and launch it, they can dismiss

00:20:13.826 --> 00:20:18.256 A:middle
that alert and then switch over
to Settings and the profiles

00:20:18.256 --> 00:20:20.426 A:middle
and remote management
area of Settings,

00:20:20.426 --> 00:20:23.666 A:middle
which was changed quite a
bit and improved in iOS 8,

00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:26.226 A:middle
they can trust the app.

00:20:27.006 --> 00:20:27.886 A:middle
And that's it.

00:20:27.886 --> 00:20:29.536 A:middle
And then any further apps

00:20:29.536 --> 00:20:31.856 A:middle
from that developer will
be automatically trusted,

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:35.176 A:middle
but they can also always come
back here and remove that trust.

00:20:35.946 --> 00:20:37.336 A:middle
It's just that easy.

00:20:38.186 --> 00:20:41.336 A:middle
Let's now turn to B2B apps.

00:20:42.816 --> 00:20:45.166 A:middle
Those of you who have
worked on MDM console

00:20:45.166 --> 00:20:48.036 A:middle
or have used one know
that it's really great.

00:20:48.036 --> 00:20:51.226 A:middle
You can have an app library
that has the nice app metadata

00:20:51.226 --> 00:20:54.126 A:middle
with the icon, the app name,
and any other details about it.

00:20:54.766 --> 00:20:58.726 A:middle
But if it's a B2B app, it
looks something more like this.

00:20:58.866 --> 00:21:02.786 A:middle
Wa Wa. Well, I really
have good news for you.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:58.866 --> 00:21:02.786 A:middle
Wa Wa. Well, I really
have good news for you.

00:21:02.786 --> 00:21:05.636 A:middle
Later this summer
you will be able

00:21:05.636 --> 00:21:08.376 A:middle
to get the same app metadata
for B2B apps that you can

00:21:08.376 --> 00:21:09.466 A:middle
for App Store apps today.

00:21:09.666 --> 00:21:11.766 A:middle
So you can make a nice
experience for your users.

00:21:12.266 --> 00:21:15.436 A:middle
What's more, that will also
allow you to get the metadata

00:21:15.436 --> 00:21:17.506 A:middle
for any apps that have been
removed from the App Store.

00:21:17.866 --> 00:21:22.276 A:middle
I thought you would be
more enthusiastic about it.

00:21:22.276 --> 00:21:23.586 A:middle
Where are all the MDM
developers [applause]?

00:21:26.456 --> 00:21:27.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TODD FERNANDEZ: All right.

00:21:27.666 --> 00:21:30.206 A:middle
At this point, we reached the
end of our distribution section.

00:21:30.396 --> 00:21:33.846 A:middle
I would like to ask Shruti Gupta
to come up here and demo a bunch

00:21:33.846 --> 00:21:37.026 A:middle
of these features on Macs
running OS X El Capitan.

00:21:37.806 --> 00:21:39.086 A:middle
Take it away.

00:21:44.086 --> 00:21:44.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; SHRUTI GUPTA: Good
morning, everyone.

00:21:44.956 --> 00:21:47.796 A:middle
I am each excited to show
you some of the cool features

00:21:47.796 --> 00:21:48.976 A:middle
that Todd talked about.

00:21:49.836 --> 00:21:52.766 A:middle
The first thing I will demo
are the new enhancements

00:21:52.766 --> 00:21:55.506 A:middle
that we have made in account
creation and password policy.

00:21:56.086 --> 00:22:02.326 A:middle
So here is my profile
manager in OS X server.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:56.086 --> 00:22:02.326 A:middle
So here is my profile
manager in OS X server.

00:22:02.646 --> 00:22:07.396 A:middle
I am using this profile manager
server as my MDM solution

00:22:08.116 --> 00:22:10.116 A:middle
where I have a couple of
Macs that are registered

00:22:10.116 --> 00:22:11.536 A:middle
in Device Enrollment Program.

00:22:11.536 --> 00:22:13.476 A:middle
If you look at the settings,

00:22:13.476 --> 00:22:16.676 A:middle
you can see that I've
already created DEP profile

00:22:16.676 --> 00:22:17.476 A:middle
for the device group.

00:22:17.686 --> 00:22:21.666 A:middle
I have skipped all the
Setup Assistant panes except

00:22:21.666 --> 00:22:23.056 A:middle
for the local account setup.

00:22:24.276 --> 00:22:26.006 A:middle
This is a new feature
that would force the user

00:22:26.006 --> 00:22:27.886 A:middle
to create a standard
user account.

00:22:28.286 --> 00:22:31.306 A:middle
Since OS X requires
an administer account,

00:22:31.306 --> 00:22:33.746 A:middle
I provided administrator
credentials here.

00:22:33.986 --> 00:22:35.646 A:middle
You have the ability to show

00:22:35.646 --> 00:22:37.886 A:middle
or hide this administrator
account from the user.

00:22:38.456 --> 00:22:40.616 A:middle
For today's demonstration
purpose I will hide the

00:22:40.616 --> 00:22:41.686 A:middle
administrator account.

00:22:42.456 --> 00:22:47.576 A:middle
I have also configured a
passcode profile for these Macs

00:22:47.906 --> 00:22:49.496 A:middle
that would require the user

00:22:49.496 --> 00:22:51.816 A:middle
to use a complex password
during this setup time.

00:22:52.396 --> 00:22:54.106 A:middle
What does this look
like on the client?

00:22:54.106 --> 00:22:54.896 A:middle
Let's take a look.

00:22:55.956 --> 00:22:58.936 A:middle
So here is my Mac that
is registered in DEP

00:22:58.936 --> 00:23:02.556 A:middle
and has been booted for the
first time OS X El Capitan,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:58.936 --> 00:23:02.556 A:middle
and has been booted for the
first time OS X El Capitan,

00:23:02.646 --> 00:23:04.886 A:middle
mimicking out-of-box
user experience.

00:23:05.186 --> 00:23:06.316 A:middle
Let's go through the setup.

00:23:06.316 --> 00:23:10.746 A:middle
I select the United States
for my country, U.S. keyboard.

00:23:12.056 --> 00:23:16.706 A:middle
Here we are at the configuration
pane, which you will see only

00:23:16.706 --> 00:23:21.436 A:middle
if the systems are configured
in DEP. So we come to them.

00:23:21.436 --> 00:23:23.416 A:middle
Now, the MDM server is
prompting me to authenticate

00:23:23.416 --> 00:23:24.946 A:middle
that my directory
server credentials.

00:23:25.446 --> 00:23:28.016 A:middle
I will enter my user
name, Shruti,

00:23:28.766 --> 00:23:30.546 A:middle
and my password, hello kitty.

00:23:30.996 --> 00:23:34.956 A:middle
So what it is doing right now,

00:23:34.956 --> 00:23:37.346 A:middle
it is enrolling this
Mac in the MDM.

00:23:37.496 --> 00:23:40.036 A:middle
It is going to fetch all the
configuration profiles ever

00:23:40.036 --> 00:23:43.056 A:middle
configured for this
Mac from my MDM server.

00:23:43.886 --> 00:23:45.756 A:middle
We are at the user account pane.

00:23:45.886 --> 00:23:49.436 A:middle
You will see we've populated
some of the information

00:23:49.436 --> 00:23:50.516 A:middle
from the previous login.

00:23:50.716 --> 00:23:55.306 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and enter
my full name here, and let's see

00:23:55.306 --> 00:23:57.046 A:middle
if it likes my hello
kitty password.

00:23:57.676 --> 00:24:01.856 A:middle
Oh, looks like I need to use
a more secure password based

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:57.676 --> 00:24:01.856 A:middle
Oh, looks like I need to use
a more secure password based

00:24:01.856 --> 00:24:03.726 A:middle
on the passcode policy
that we set earlier.

00:24:04.006 --> 00:24:06.496 A:middle
I will enter a new
password here.

00:24:07.776 --> 00:24:11.016 A:middle
What is cool about this is, it
gives you immediate feedback

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:12.456 A:middle
as I'm entering the password.

00:24:13.796 --> 00:24:16.826 A:middle
I'm going to complete the
Password Verification field

00:24:16.826 --> 00:24:18.016 A:middle
and continue.

00:24:18.786 --> 00:24:22.146 A:middle
So it is creating the
user account as well

00:24:22.146 --> 00:24:25.096 A:middle
as the hidden administrator
account in the background.

00:24:25.666 --> 00:24:28.546 A:middle
I'm going to select the time
zone now, and you'll notice

00:24:28.546 --> 00:24:29.926 A:middle
that I didn't have
to go through any

00:24:29.926 --> 00:24:32.776 A:middle
of the location services pane
or the iCloud sign in pane

00:24:32.776 --> 00:24:37.336 A:middle
because we configured it to skip
all those Setup Assistant panes.

00:24:37.336 --> 00:24:39.526 A:middle
Here, our account is all set up.

00:24:39.726 --> 00:24:41.946 A:middle
Let's see what kind of
account really got created.

00:24:42.246 --> 00:24:43.926 A:middle
I will launch System
Preferences,

00:24:44.606 --> 00:24:46.676 A:middle
go to Users and Groups.

00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:50.596 A:middle
You can see it is a
standard user account.

00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:53.396 A:middle
The administrator
account is not visible.

00:24:53.586 --> 00:24:56.706 A:middle
Just to prove that administrator
account really got created,

00:24:56.876 --> 00:24:58.236 A:middle
I'm going to unlock the pane

00:24:58.236 --> 00:24:59.716 A:middle
with my administrator
credentials

00:24:59.716 --> 00:25:01.936 A:middle
that I provided on
the MDM server.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:59.716 --> 00:25:01.936 A:middle
that I provided on
the MDM server.

00:25:02.326 --> 00:25:05.396 A:middle
Ta-da! You can see that
it's unlocked successfully.

00:25:06.556 --> 00:25:09.586 A:middle
The next thing I'm going to demo
is one of the coolest features,

00:25:09.586 --> 00:25:11.876 A:middle
and I'm sure many of you
have been waiting for,

00:25:12.046 --> 00:25:14.726 A:middle
being able to assign
VPP app to the devices

00:25:15.006 --> 00:25:18.136 A:middle
without requiring the user to
log in with their Apple ID.

00:25:19.546 --> 00:25:25.986 A:middle
So I'm going to push a VPP app
to this Mac, which is going

00:25:25.986 --> 00:25:28.546 A:middle
to be Apple Configurator app.

00:25:31.276 --> 00:25:34.156 A:middle
So while it pushes
the app, let's see,

00:25:34.156 --> 00:25:37.136 A:middle
check in the App Store
that I'm not signed in.

00:25:37.136 --> 00:25:40.076 A:middle
So we look at the Store menu.

00:25:40.076 --> 00:25:41.766 A:middle
You can see that I'm
not signed in here.

00:25:41.766 --> 00:25:43.776 A:middle
If you notice, the app
has already started

00:25:43.776 --> 00:25:45.006 A:middle
to install in the LaunchPad.

00:25:45.066 --> 00:25:48.306 A:middle
There is our Apple
Configurator app.

00:25:48.436 --> 00:25:55.446 A:middle
Thank you, back to Todd.

00:25:55.446 --> 00:25:55.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TODD FERNANDEZ: All right.

00:25:55.896 --> 00:25:56.786 A:middle
Thank you very much, Shruti.

00:25:57.716 --> 00:25:58.826 A:middle
So what did we just see?

00:25:59.076 --> 00:26:01.886 A:middle
Shruti installed a passcode
policy before the user account

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.076 --> 00:26:01.886 A:middle
Shruti installed a passcode
policy before the user account

00:26:01.886 --> 00:26:03.696 A:middle
was created, and it
was respected while

00:26:03.696 --> 00:26:04.886 A:middle
that user account was created.

00:26:05.556 --> 00:26:06.766 A:middle
It was a standard user account

00:26:06.766 --> 00:26:08.426 A:middle
that was created instead
of an admin account.

00:26:09.146 --> 00:26:12.576 A:middle
She also created an admin
account that she could use

00:26:12.576 --> 00:26:17.136 A:middle
if she needed to log in directly
on the Mac or remotely later.

00:26:18.206 --> 00:26:21.696 A:middle
She also showed you assigning
a VPP app to a device.

00:26:24.056 --> 00:26:26.886 A:middle
So let's move on to the third
section of today's session

00:26:27.536 --> 00:26:30.216 A:middle
and talk about ongoing
management of devices.

00:26:30.806 --> 00:26:33.276 A:middle
First, I would like
to highlight the fact

00:26:33.276 --> 00:26:36.976 A:middle
that iOS 9 supports
Exchange ActiveSync 16,

00:26:37.546 --> 00:26:38.996 A:middle
specifically a number
of improvements

00:26:38.996 --> 00:26:41.806 A:middle
to calendar support,
including improved reliability

00:26:41.806 --> 00:26:44.886 A:middle
for a number of common tasks
and support for attachments

00:26:44.976 --> 00:26:46.116 A:middle
in physical locations.

00:26:46.326 --> 00:26:51.836 A:middle
Now let's turn to our own
MDM protocol and profiles.

00:26:52.326 --> 00:26:54.216 A:middle
There are a number of
new commands and queries,

00:26:54.456 --> 00:26:57.866 A:middle
and the ones I want to highlight
at the top, there's a new query

00:26:57.866 --> 00:27:00.306 A:middle
that tells you what software
updates are available

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:57.866 --> 00:27:00.306 A:middle
that tells you what software
updates are available

00:27:00.306 --> 00:27:04.286 A:middle
for that device and a command
that will tell the iOS device

00:27:04.286 --> 00:27:08.306 A:middle
to update to the latest
iOS for any devices in DEP.

00:27:09.516 --> 00:27:12.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:13.046 --> 00:27:14.576 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TODD FERNANDEZ: Including
being able to tell the devices

00:27:14.576 --> 00:27:17.886 A:middle
to download and stage the update
so you can then command them all

00:27:17.886 --> 00:27:19.016 A:middle
to update at the same time.

00:27:20.716 --> 00:27:23.336 A:middle
I've already talked about the
remaining commands and queries

00:27:23.336 --> 00:27:27.016 A:middle
in the enrollment section
and the distribution section.

00:27:27.016 --> 00:27:28.536 A:middle
So I won't spend any
more time on those.

00:27:29.496 --> 00:27:32.196 A:middle
Now let's turn to what's new
with configuration profiles.

00:27:32.676 --> 00:27:35.616 A:middle
There are two new payloads,
network usage rules,

00:27:35.876 --> 00:27:37.426 A:middle
which allows an organization

00:27:37.426 --> 00:27:39.906 A:middle
to control how their
managed apps use the network,

00:27:40.366 --> 00:27:42.676 A:middle
whether they're allowed
to use cell data or roam.

00:27:43.746 --> 00:27:47.666 A:middle
The OS X server account
payload configures whether apps

00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:50.596 A:middle
that support the document
provider API can access

00:27:50.596 --> 00:27:52.516 A:middle
documents on their
OS X server account.

00:27:53.456 --> 00:27:54.716 A:middle
There are a number of
other settings added

00:27:54.716 --> 00:27:57.806 A:middle
to existing payloads,
including a lot of changes

00:27:57.836 --> 00:28:02.106 A:middle
in the IKEv2 VPN connection
type, more about that later,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:57.836 --> 00:28:02.106 A:middle
in the IKEv2 VPN connection
type, more about that later,

00:28:02.806 --> 00:28:05.036 A:middle
and a large number
of new restrictions.

00:28:05.106 --> 00:28:06.056 A:middle
So let's look at those.

00:28:07.186 --> 00:28:08.796 A:middle
There are a handful
that are applicable

00:28:08.796 --> 00:28:12.036 A:middle
on unsupervised devices,
including the ability

00:28:12.036 --> 00:28:14.746 A:middle
to prevent users from trusting
additional enterprise app

00:28:14.986 --> 00:28:16.296 A:middle
authors that I mentioned
earlier.

00:28:17.656 --> 00:28:21.946 A:middle
We also now allow you to
tell AirDrop to be treated

00:28:21.946 --> 00:28:23.796 A:middle
as an unmanaged destination
[applause].

00:28:25.136 --> 00:28:25.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TODD FERNANDEZ: All right!

00:28:25.596 --> 00:28:27.216 A:middle
But the final thing I want

00:28:27.216 --> 00:28:30.546 A:middle
to highlight here are
the three restrictions,

00:28:30.586 --> 00:28:32.856 A:middle
third from the bottom,
modify device name,

00:28:32.856 --> 00:28:34.136 A:middle
passcode, and wallpaper.

00:28:34.676 --> 00:28:37.526 A:middle
These are particularly useful
in shared device deployments.

00:28:37.526 --> 00:28:40.026 A:middle
If you have, say, some
might say creative,

00:28:40.486 --> 00:28:43.506 A:middle
others might say malicious,
students who like to mess

00:28:43.506 --> 00:28:45.686 A:middle
with their devices, you
can now prevent them

00:28:45.686 --> 00:28:48.076 A:middle
from changing the device
name, setting a passcode,

00:28:48.076 --> 00:28:49.216 A:middle
or changing the wallpaper.

00:28:50.516 --> 00:28:53.606 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:54.106 --> 00:28:54.836 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TODD FERNANDEZ:
One final note

00:28:54.836 --> 00:28:57.996 A:middle
about configuration profile
restrictions in iOS 9.

00:28:58.506 --> 00:29:00.216 A:middle
There are a number
of restrictions,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.506 --> 00:29:00.216 A:middle
There are a number
of restrictions,

00:29:00.216 --> 00:29:03.666 A:middle
these nine in fact, created
before supervision existed.

00:29:04.046 --> 00:29:07.566 A:middle
And in fact, they really
should only be applicable

00:29:07.566 --> 00:29:08.806 A:middle
on supervised devices.

00:29:09.306 --> 00:29:12.806 A:middle
So this is your early warning
that they are still applicable

00:29:12.806 --> 00:29:16.816 A:middle
or they still are honored on
unsupervised devices in iOS 9,

00:29:17.326 --> 00:29:19.016 A:middle
but in an iOS version

00:29:19.016 --> 00:29:21.206 A:middle
to be named later they
will be only honored

00:29:21.206 --> 00:29:22.476 A:middle
on supervised devices.

00:29:22.476 --> 00:29:25.006 A:middle
Now let's turn to OS X.

00:29:26.596 --> 00:29:31.016 A:middle
Just like in iOS 9, OS X El
Capitan gives you a new query

00:29:31.016 --> 00:29:33.376 A:middle
that tells you what software
updates are available

00:29:33.376 --> 00:29:36.336 A:middle
for that Mac, and you can
tell it to install one or more

00:29:36.336 --> 00:29:37.746 A:middle
of those updates if the Mac is

00:29:37.746 --> 00:29:43.846 A:middle
in DEP. The device information
query achieves parity with iOS

00:29:44.256 --> 00:29:47.076 A:middle
and you can now obtain, if
you are using user assignments

00:29:47.076 --> 00:29:49.426 A:middle
for VPP managed distribution,
you can now see

00:29:49.426 --> 00:29:51.456 A:middle
which account is
configured on that device.

00:29:52.826 --> 00:29:54.506 A:middle
We already talked about
setup configuration

00:29:54.506 --> 00:29:57.006 A:middle
and device-configured commands
in the enrollment section.

00:29:58.086 --> 00:30:00.806 A:middle
There's also an active
managed users query,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:58.086 --> 00:30:00.806 A:middle
There's also an active
managed users query,

00:30:00.946 --> 00:30:04.206 A:middle
which will tell the server
which users are logged in

00:30:04.206 --> 00:30:07.246 A:middle
and actively using the
Mac so you can clean

00:30:07.246 --> 00:30:09.226 A:middle
up obsolete unused sessions.

00:30:09.746 --> 00:30:15.386 A:middle
There are also some changes
to configuration profiles.

00:30:15.786 --> 00:30:17.896 A:middle
There's a new payload to
configure an Ethernet proxy

00:30:18.726 --> 00:30:21.436 A:middle
and a number of settings
for other payloads,

00:30:21.436 --> 00:30:23.146 A:middle
including a handful
of restrictions

00:30:23.266 --> 00:30:25.296 A:middle
that were previously
available on iOS

00:30:25.296 --> 00:30:30.446 A:middle
and now also are
available on OS X.

00:30:30.476 --> 00:30:33.316 A:middle
As I alluded to earlier, there
are a lot of changes in VPN

00:30:33.316 --> 00:30:35.086 A:middle
and enterprise network
connectivity.

00:30:35.366 --> 00:30:36.966 A:middle
I encourage you to come

00:30:36.966 --> 00:30:38.676 A:middle
and checkout their
session Friday morning

00:30:38.676 --> 00:30:39.596 A:middle
and learn all about that.

00:30:40.096 --> 00:30:41.886 A:middle
I will not steal
their thunder here.

00:30:43.436 --> 00:30:46.276 A:middle
That brings us to the end
of the management section.

00:30:46.276 --> 00:30:48.146 A:middle
I would like to ask
Shruti to show you some

00:30:48.146 --> 00:30:49.386 A:middle
of these features on iOS.

00:30:50.516 --> 00:30:54.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:55.046 --> 00:30:55.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; SHRUTI GUPTA:
Thank you, Todd.

00:30:55.886 --> 00:30:56.646 A:middle
Hello again.

00:30:56.886 --> 00:31:00.306 A:middle
So I'm going to demo some of
the new features on iOS now.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:56.886 --> 00:31:00.306 A:middle
So I'm going to demo some of
the new features on iOS now.

00:31:01.016 --> 00:31:05.036 A:middle
So here is my device
that is running iOS 9.

00:31:05.036 --> 00:31:09.216 A:middle
It is already enrolled in DEP.
If you look at the settings,

00:31:09.216 --> 00:31:12.206 A:middle
you can see that I can currently
set a passcode on this device.

00:31:12.726 --> 00:31:14.536 A:middle
I can change the wallpaper.

00:31:14.536 --> 00:31:18.936 A:middle
And if I go to General,
About, Name,

00:31:19.186 --> 00:31:21.466 A:middle
you can see that I can
edit the device name too.

00:31:21.466 --> 00:31:25.436 A:middle
Let's go to restrict these
settings using our MDM server.

00:31:26.046 --> 00:31:30.626 A:middle
So the server is now sending the
push notification to the device.

00:31:30.626 --> 00:31:33.746 A:middle
Keep your eyes on the screen
as the settings get updated.

00:31:34.316 --> 00:31:35.936 A:middle
There you go, you can see

00:31:36.256 --> 00:31:38.736 A:middle
that I can no longer set
a passcode on this device.

00:31:38.806 --> 00:31:40.636 A:middle
I cannot change the wallpaper.

00:31:40.926 --> 00:31:42.806 A:middle
If I try to tap on
the Name field,

00:31:42.806 --> 00:31:44.756 A:middle
I cannot change the
device name either.

00:31:46.136 --> 00:31:48.986 A:middle
Earlier we saw VPP
app assignment on Mac.

00:31:49.376 --> 00:31:53.736 A:middle
Now we are going to see VPP app
assignment on the iOS device.

00:31:53.736 --> 00:31:58.256 A:middle
I am going to push a
VPP app to this device,

00:31:58.256 --> 00:32:01.166 A:middle
which is going to be WWDC app.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:58.256 --> 00:32:01.166 A:middle
which is going to be WWDC app.

00:32:01.166 --> 00:32:03.686 A:middle
Let's confirm I'm not signed

00:32:03.686 --> 00:32:05.826 A:middle
into the App Store here
while it's pushing the app

00:32:05.826 --> 00:32:06.566 A:middle
from the server.

00:32:07.116 --> 00:32:08.476 A:middle
I go to App Store Settings,

00:32:08.546 --> 00:32:11.016 A:middle
you can see that I'm not
signed in with my Apple ID.

00:32:11.866 --> 00:32:15.076 A:middle
If you go to the Home
screen, you'll notice

00:32:15.076 --> 00:32:16.746 A:middle
that App Store does
not exist there.

00:32:16.746 --> 00:32:19.176 A:middle
That is because I
restricted the App Store

00:32:19.176 --> 00:32:20.846 A:middle
from installing apps
on this device.

00:32:21.166 --> 00:32:23.696 A:middle
&gt;&gt; SHRUTI GUPTA: I guess
I'll give it back to Todd.

00:32:24.236 --> 00:32:24.606 A:middle
Thank you.

00:32:25.516 --> 00:32:28.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:32:29.046 --> 00:32:29.696 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TODD FERNANDEZ:
Thank you, Shruti.

00:32:29.696 --> 00:32:30.666 A:middle
You trust us, right?

00:32:31.696 --> 00:32:32.446 A:middle
It works great.

00:32:32.446 --> 00:32:33.846 A:middle
All right.

00:32:34.156 --> 00:32:35.966 A:middle
So what did Shruti
just show you?

00:32:35.966 --> 00:32:38.716 A:middle
Again taking advantage of
the three new restrictions

00:32:38.716 --> 00:32:41.666 A:middle
to prevent students and
others from changing things

00:32:41.666 --> 00:32:43.406 A:middle
on the device that you
don't want them to change,

00:32:44.016 --> 00:32:47.766 A:middle
and being able to assign apps
to devices and install apps

00:32:47.766 --> 00:32:50.126 A:middle
on devices even when the
App Store is disabled.

00:32:50.166 --> 00:32:53.776 A:middle
So let's turn to
our fourth section

00:32:53.876 --> 00:32:55.616 A:middle
and talk a few minutes
about tools.

00:32:56.156 --> 00:32:59.156 A:middle
The first tools that
I want to highlight,

00:32:59.926 --> 00:33:01.776 A:middle
I hope that you MDM
develops are aware of.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:59.926 --> 00:33:01.776 A:middle
I hope that you MDM
develops are aware of.

00:33:01.846 --> 00:33:03.396 A:middle
If not, this is your moment.

00:33:03.836 --> 00:33:05.946 A:middle
We created over the
past year simulators

00:33:05.946 --> 00:33:07.686 A:middle
for both the Device
Enrollment Program

00:33:07.686 --> 00:33:09.146 A:middle
and the Volume Purchase Program.

00:33:09.796 --> 00:33:11.406 A:middle
It allows you to
simulate large numbers

00:33:11.406 --> 00:33:13.786 A:middle
of devices hitting
your server as well

00:33:13.786 --> 00:33:16.496 A:middle
as all the service errors that
may be difficult to simulate

00:33:16.496 --> 00:33:18.766 A:middle
in any other way and
test your handling

00:33:18.766 --> 00:33:19.806 A:middle
to make sure it's robust.

00:33:20.866 --> 00:33:22.506 A:middle
Both simulators are
available for download

00:33:22.506 --> 00:33:23.706 A:middle
on the Developer portal,

00:33:23.946 --> 00:33:25.686 A:middle
and we've released
new versions this week

00:33:25.686 --> 00:33:26.996 A:middle
that support all
the new features

00:33:26.996 --> 00:33:27.976 A:middle
that we talked about today.

00:33:28.686 --> 00:33:31.186 A:middle
Please, download and
use them to make sure

00:33:31.186 --> 00:33:35.226 A:middle
that your implementations
are as robust as they can be.

00:33:35.476 --> 00:33:37.806 A:middle
We use them to test our own
device management tools.

00:33:38.316 --> 00:33:42.556 A:middle
For example, Profile
Manager, which, of course,

00:33:42.556 --> 00:33:44.596 A:middle
has been updated to support
all these new features.

00:33:44.676 --> 00:33:48.376 A:middle
Shruti showed you its support
for several of them today.

00:33:49.166 --> 00:33:51.346 A:middle
Apple Configurator plays a role

00:33:51.346 --> 00:33:54.296 A:middle
in automated enrollment using
the Device Enrollment Program.

00:33:55.676 --> 00:33:57.636 A:middle
I want to talk about
Configurator.

00:33:58.286 --> 00:33:59.746 A:middle
Here is Configurator.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:00.486 --> 00:34:01.986 A:middle
Has the three workflows.

00:34:02.646 --> 00:34:04.836 A:middle
Prepare, you can configure
how the devices are prepared

00:34:04.836 --> 00:34:06.636 A:middle
and supervised, and assign them.

00:34:07.196 --> 00:34:10.956 A:middle
It was initially the only
way to supervise devices.

00:34:11.226 --> 00:34:13.676 A:middle
You can install VPP apps
using redemption codes.

00:34:13.676 --> 00:34:14.866 A:middle
You can install profiles.

00:34:15.706 --> 00:34:17.446 A:middle
It maintains and
builds up a database

00:34:17.446 --> 00:34:20.496 A:middle
as you supervise
devices, and import apps

00:34:20.496 --> 00:34:22.606 A:middle
from iTunes, and
create profiles.

00:34:23.906 --> 00:34:26.505 A:middle
We received feedback
over the last three years

00:34:27.025 --> 00:34:29.585 A:middle
and learned a lot about
managing iOS devices

00:34:29.585 --> 00:34:30.795 A:middle
over the last seven years.

00:34:31.485 --> 00:34:34.616 A:middle
I am thrilled to tell you we
have completely reinvented Apple

00:34:34.616 --> 00:34:38.656 A:middle
Configurator and created
Apple Configurator 2.

00:34:39.516 --> 00:34:43.545 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:34:44.045 --> 00:34:44.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TODD FERNANDEZ: So
what were our goals

00:34:44.826 --> 00:34:46.775 A:middle
in creating Apple
Configurator 2?

00:34:47.956 --> 00:34:50.235 A:middle
We wanted to invert
the user experience

00:34:50.406 --> 00:34:52.096 A:middle
and put your devices
front and center.

00:34:52.096 --> 00:34:54.496 A:middle
That's what you are looking at
in your cart or on your desk,

00:34:54.696 --> 00:34:57.106 A:middle
and show you the state
your devices are in,

00:34:57.106 --> 00:34:59.316 A:middle
which makes it easier for you
to understand what you can do

00:34:59.316 --> 00:35:00.536 A:middle
with them and what
is going to happen.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:59.316 --> 00:35:00.536 A:middle
with them and what
is going to happen.

00:35:01.516 --> 00:35:05.316 A:middle
We've broken apart the workflows
and given you discrete tasks

00:35:05.506 --> 00:35:07.596 A:middle
so you can perform
exactly what you need to do

00:35:07.596 --> 00:35:09.556 A:middle
on a specific group
of devices right now.

00:35:10.636 --> 00:35:13.286 A:middle
While at the same time
making it very easy

00:35:13.376 --> 00:35:16.986 A:middle
to combine those discrete
tasks into custom workflows

00:35:17.196 --> 00:35:18.486 A:middle
to prepare your devices

00:35:18.546 --> 00:35:21.436 A:middle
and manage them just the
way you want [applause].

00:35:25.336 --> 00:35:26.576 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TODD FERNANDEZ: We
also heard that many

00:35:26.576 --> 00:35:28.486 A:middle
of you are using multiple
Configurator stations,

00:35:28.486 --> 00:35:30.536 A:middle
some even hundreds in a
large school district.

00:35:30.956 --> 00:35:34.326 A:middle
You want to better be able to
share data between the stations

00:35:34.326 --> 00:35:36.196 A:middle
and freely move devices
between them.

00:35:37.676 --> 00:35:41.096 A:middle
We also of course want Apple
Configurator to be a great tool

00:35:41.096 --> 00:35:42.766 A:middle
for managing a small
number of devices

00:35:42.766 --> 00:35:44.616 A:middle
in a classroom, or
a cart, or a lab.

00:35:45.166 --> 00:35:47.126 A:middle
But we also want it to
be a great companion

00:35:47.126 --> 00:35:49.826 A:middle
to the Device Enrollment
Program and an MDM server,

00:35:49.826 --> 00:35:51.776 A:middle
which is doing the bulk
of the remote management.

00:35:51.856 --> 00:35:53.726 A:middle
But you might want to
use Apple Configurator

00:35:53.726 --> 00:35:56.236 A:middle
for a few tasks here and there.

00:35:56.286 --> 00:35:58.146 A:middle
Instead of me talking
about it anymore,

00:35:58.146 --> 00:35:59.686 A:middle
I would like to invite
Enrique Osuna

00:35:59.836 --> 00:36:02.096 A:middle

Configurator 2.

&gt;&gt; ENRIQUE OSUNA: Thanks, Todd.

00:36:10.046 --> 00:36:11.356 A:middle
I'm excited to be
here to talk to you

00:36:11.356 --> 00:36:12.486 A:middle
about Apple Configurator 2.

00:36:12.486 --> 00:36:14.576 A:middle
Why don't we go ahead
and get started.

00:36:15.596 --> 00:36:17.536 A:middle
The first thing you'll see

00:36:17.536 --> 00:36:19.186 A:middle
when you launch Apple
Configurator is the

00:36:19.186 --> 00:36:20.076 A:middle
Devices window.

00:36:20.416 --> 00:36:23.566 A:middle
This Devices window has all
of your connected devices.

00:36:24.056 --> 00:36:26.726 A:middle
Each of the connected devices
are represented by this icon.

00:36:27.256 --> 00:36:28.936 A:middle
These particular
icons have an image

00:36:28.936 --> 00:36:30.026 A:middle
of the device's Home screen.

00:36:30.536 --> 00:36:31.546 A:middle
This is Configurator's way

00:36:31.546 --> 00:36:33.926 A:middle
to tell you these devices
have been prepared.

00:36:34.876 --> 00:36:37.826 A:middle
Everywhere in Configurator where
you see a collection of icons,

00:36:38.476 --> 00:36:40.286 A:middle
you can also view the
same data as a list.

00:36:40.996 --> 00:36:42.766 A:middle
You can get there by
clicking on the View button

00:36:42.766 --> 00:36:45.356 A:middle
in the toolbar and
clicking on List.

00:36:46.946 --> 00:36:48.806 A:middle
Here, you see the
same connected devices

00:36:49.236 --> 00:36:50.666 A:middle
with additional information.

00:36:51.826 --> 00:36:54.796 A:middle
To go back to the collection of
icons, click on the View button,

00:36:54.796 --> 00:36:56.776 A:middle
and back to Collection.

00:36:58.036 --> 00:37:00.786 A:middle
One of the key features that
Todd mentioned was the ability

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:58.036 --> 00:37:00.786 A:middle
One of the key features that
Todd mentioned was the ability

00:37:00.786 --> 00:37:03.616 A:middle
to perform discrete tasks
on connected devices.

00:37:04.386 --> 00:37:06.446 A:middle
These tasks are found
in the Actions menu.

00:37:07.356 --> 00:37:10.796 A:middle
In the Actions menu you can
do things like add, remove,

00:37:10.796 --> 00:37:15.026 A:middle
modify existing content as well
as back up and prepare devices.

00:37:15.576 --> 00:37:17.716 A:middle
We will talk more about
prepare in a second.

00:37:18.636 --> 00:37:21.926 A:middle
In the Devices window you
see a big toolbar at the top.

00:37:22.276 --> 00:37:24.996 A:middle
The toolbar has all of the
common actions of Configurator,

00:37:25.476 --> 00:37:26.766 A:middle
such as the Update button here.

00:37:27.286 --> 00:37:29.796 A:middle
In the upper right-hand corner

00:37:29.796 --> 00:37:32.436 A:middle
of these connected devices
you see this big red badge.

00:37:33.006 --> 00:37:34.806 A:middle
What this red badge indicates is

00:37:34.806 --> 00:37:36.296 A:middle
that these devices
require an update.

00:37:37.206 --> 00:37:39.326 A:middle
I'll go ahead and see what
updates are available.

00:37:39.416 --> 00:37:40.686 A:middle
Let me select all my devices.

00:37:43.156 --> 00:37:44.836 A:middle
Click on the Update
button in the toolbar.

00:37:44.916 --> 00:37:48.876 A:middle
Now what Configurator is doing
is contacting the iTunes Store,

00:37:49.886 --> 00:37:52.816 A:middle
figuring out if there's
any iOS or app updates.

00:37:53.286 --> 00:37:55.326 A:middle
Now, you can see that
Configurator has identified

00:37:55.326 --> 00:37:58.576 A:middle
that the WWDC app on my
devices need an update.

00:37:59.076 --> 00:38:01.526 A:middle
So I can update that app by
clicking the Update button.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:59.076 --> 00:38:01.526 A:middle
So I can update that app by
clicking the Update button.

00:38:02.596 --> 00:38:07.806 A:middle
Configurator is contacting the
Store, downloading the apps,

00:38:07.806 --> 00:38:09.576 A:middle
and actually installing
them onto the devices.

00:38:10.226 --> 00:38:13.416 A:middle
For those who didn't notice,
I didn't have to launch iTunes

00:38:13.416 --> 00:38:14.646 A:middle
in this entire transaction.

00:38:15.516 --> 00:38:19.796 A:middle
[ Cheers &amp; Applause ]

00:38:20.296 --> 00:38:22.696 A:middle
&gt;&gt; ENRIQUE OSUNA: Configurator
no longer has a database of apps

00:38:23.026 --> 00:38:24.296 A:middle
that you have to
manage or maintain.

00:38:24.296 --> 00:38:28.206 A:middle
Now, as Configurator is
finishing up the app install,

00:38:28.436 --> 00:38:30.876 A:middle
you'll notice the big
red badge that was

00:38:30.876 --> 00:38:33.546 A:middle
in the upper right-hand corner
should start disappearing

00:38:33.546 --> 00:38:34.126 A:middle
here shortly.

00:38:35.226 --> 00:38:37.666 A:middle
This is an indicator that
these devices no longer require

00:38:37.666 --> 00:38:37.956 A:middle
an update.

00:38:46.046 --> 00:38:48.506 A:middle
Now, right before
this presentation,

00:38:48.506 --> 00:38:50.986 A:middle
I was actually having some
problems on one of my pads.

00:38:50.986 --> 00:38:54.106 A:middle
It was probably that one, trying
to get on to the WiFi network.

00:38:54.596 --> 00:38:57.296 A:middle
Let's look at what
might be going on.

00:38:57.296 --> 00:38:59.636 A:middle
If I double-click on
one of these devices,

00:38:59.896 --> 00:39:03.396 A:middle
Configurator launches you into
this new UI that allows you

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:59.896 --> 00:39:03.396 A:middle
Configurator launches you into
this new UI that allows you

00:39:03.396 --> 00:39:05.126 A:middle
to see some information
about your device.

00:39:05.606 --> 00:39:08.816 A:middle
You can find things like the
device's name, serial number,

00:39:08.886 --> 00:39:10.916 A:middle
as well as organization
information.

00:39:11.646 --> 00:39:14.156 A:middle
In the left sidebar,
you can find apps.

00:39:14.626 --> 00:39:16.266 A:middle
These are the apps
actually installed

00:39:16.266 --> 00:39:18.896 A:middle
on my device, as
well as profiles.

00:39:19.126 --> 00:39:22.156 A:middle
These are the profiles that
are installed on my device.

00:39:22.696 --> 00:39:25.596 A:middle
Unfortunately, this device
is missing my WiFi profile.

00:39:25.776 --> 00:39:28.116 A:middle
I'm sure I have other
devices in my cart

00:39:28.116 --> 00:39:30.116 A:middle
that are missing
a profile as well.

00:39:30.116 --> 00:39:32.276 A:middle
Let's go ahead and see if
we can't figure it out.

00:39:32.276 --> 00:39:35.416 A:middle
I can go back to all
my devices by clicking

00:39:35.416 --> 00:39:36.716 A:middle
on the Back button
in the toolbar.

00:39:37.896 --> 00:39:39.166 A:middle
Here are my connected devices.

00:39:39.166 --> 00:39:42.216 A:middle
If I go to the Search field
in the upper right-hand corner

00:39:43.396 --> 00:39:44.836 A:middle
and start typing WiFi,

00:39:47.896 --> 00:39:50.716 A:middle
Configurator offers me
this fancy suggestion

00:39:51.416 --> 00:39:54.306 A:middle
of all the devices that have
the WiFi profile installed.

00:39:54.306 --> 00:39:56.746 A:middle
The problem that I have is not

00:39:56.746 --> 00:39:58.786 A:middle
which devices have the
profile already installed.

00:39:59.106 --> 00:40:01.126 A:middle
It's the devices that don't
have the profile installed.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.106 --> 00:40:01.126 A:middle
It's the devices that don't
have the profile installed.

00:40:01.126 --> 00:40:03.466 A:middle
If I click on the token
in the Search field

00:40:03.496 --> 00:40:06.196 A:middle
and it says profile
is not installed,

00:40:06.196 --> 00:40:09.996 A:middle
Configurator will show me the
two pads missing the profile.

00:40:10.356 --> 00:40:11.886 A:middle
Let me fix the problem.

00:40:12.296 --> 00:40:15.896 A:middle
I'll select both devices,
click on the Add button

00:40:15.896 --> 00:40:18.516 A:middle
in the toolbar, and
click on Profiles.

00:40:18.516 --> 00:40:23.546 A:middle
Configurator 2 no longer
has a database of profiles.

00:40:24.046 --> 00:40:26.426 A:middle
These profiles can be found
anywhere on your disk.

00:40:26.426 --> 00:40:28.536 A:middle
Let's navigate to the desktop.

00:40:28.946 --> 00:40:30.846 A:middle
Here I have my WiFi profile.

00:40:31.206 --> 00:40:35.876 A:middle
What is neat, you can have these
profiles on mounted volumes

00:40:35.876 --> 00:40:37.166 A:middle
and even in your iCloud drive.

00:40:37.166 --> 00:40:41.846 A:middle
Now that Configurator is done,
I can clear the Search field

00:40:42.236 --> 00:40:43.796 A:middle
and I can see my
connected devices again.

00:40:44.256 --> 00:40:46.186 A:middle
Another cool feature

00:40:46.186 --> 00:40:49.166 A:middle
of Configurator 2 is the
ability to tag a device.

00:40:49.546 --> 00:40:53.286 A:middle
Tagging a device allows you to
create device groups, but again,

00:40:53.286 --> 00:40:55.096 A:middle
without a database of devices.

00:40:55.096 --> 00:40:56.796 A:middle
I can show you that right now.

00:40:57.326 --> 00:41:01.006 A:middle
If I select a couple of these
devices, go to the toolbar,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:57.326 --> 00:41:01.006 A:middle
If I select a couple of these
devices, go to the toolbar,

00:41:01.006 --> 00:41:04.726 A:middle
and click on the Tag button
and select a few of these tags.

00:41:06.376 --> 00:41:07.376 A:middle
Press the Return key.

00:41:08.036 --> 00:41:09.676 A:middle
What Configurator
is doing is writing

00:41:09.676 --> 00:41:10.966 A:middle
that tag to these devices.

00:41:11.486 --> 00:41:13.096 A:middle
What is neat about the tags,

00:41:13.096 --> 00:41:15.606 A:middle
it is actually written
to the device.

00:41:15.606 --> 00:41:18.696 A:middle
When you transport this device
to another Configurator station,

00:41:19.046 --> 00:41:20.836 A:middle
those same tags appear
there as well.

00:41:22.336 --> 00:41:24.126 A:middle
If I go back to the
same Search field

00:41:24.126 --> 00:41:26.626 A:middle
in the upper right-hand corner
and start looking for my tag,

00:41:28.146 --> 00:41:30.166 A:middle
I start getting a
suggestion, fourth grade,

00:41:30.166 --> 00:41:31.436 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead
and click on that.

00:41:32.366 --> 00:41:35.636 A:middle
Now Configurator is
showing me just the pads

00:41:35.636 --> 00:41:37.416 A:middle
that are tagged with
fourth grade.

00:41:37.486 --> 00:41:39.976 A:middle
Right under the Search field --

00:41:40.516 --> 00:41:43.696 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:41:44.196 --> 00:41:45.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; ENRIQUE OSUNA:
Under the Search field,

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:46.156 A:middle
there's a Save button.

00:41:47.156 --> 00:41:50.246 A:middle
Configurator allows me to save
this search for later use.

00:41:50.886 --> 00:41:52.336 A:middle
Let me click on the Save button.

00:41:53.026 --> 00:41:55.456 A:middle
You'll notice a new entry in
the favorites bar right here.

00:41:56.446 --> 00:41:58.326 A:middle
Now, whenever I add
another device

00:41:58.376 --> 00:42:01.216 A:middle
that has the fourth grade tag
attached to it, it will appear

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:58.376 --> 00:42:01.216 A:middle
that has the fourth grade tag
attached to it, it will appear

00:42:01.216 --> 00:42:02.056 A:middle
in this particular view.

00:42:03.566 --> 00:42:06.946 A:middle
So one last thing that I want
to do is rename my devices.

00:42:07.106 --> 00:42:09.996 A:middle
Let's go back to all devices
right here in the favorites bar.

00:42:09.996 --> 00:42:13.176 A:middle
And let me select
all of my devices.

00:42:14.706 --> 00:42:17.206 A:middle
Go to the Actions menu.

00:42:17.206 --> 00:42:19.316 A:middle
Modify. Device name.

00:42:20.126 --> 00:42:21.126 A:middle
Like Configurator 1,

00:42:21.126 --> 00:42:23.806 A:middle
Configurator 2 can
rename your devices.

00:42:24.236 --> 00:42:27.866 A:middle
We offer you an opportunity
to provide static text.

00:42:28.046 --> 00:42:31.826 A:middle
Let me go ahead and give
it some static text.

00:42:31.946 --> 00:42:34.736 A:middle
And in Configurator 1,
we introduced a feature

00:42:34.936 --> 00:42:37.886 A:middle
that allowed you to append
an autoincrementing number

00:42:37.886 --> 00:42:38.756 A:middle
to the field.

00:42:39.336 --> 00:42:41.716 A:middle
In Configurator 2, we kind
of let you do that too,

00:42:41.716 --> 00:42:44.946 A:middle
but we do that through what
we like to call a token.

00:42:45.136 --> 00:42:49.306 A:middle
These tokens can be put
anywhere in the name.

00:42:49.986 --> 00:42:52.056 A:middle
Here you see the
autoincrementing number.

00:42:52.946 --> 00:42:54.766 A:middle
You see other information
about the device,

00:42:54.766 --> 00:42:59.446 A:middle
like the device's serial
number, type, and capacity.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:00.176 --> 00:43:02.316 A:middle
For this demonstration,
I like to use type

00:43:03.746 --> 00:43:05.046 A:middle
and the autoincrementing number.

00:43:06.396 --> 00:43:07.456 A:middle
Now I click on Rename.

00:43:07.936 --> 00:43:11.316 A:middle
Configurator is now going
through all these devices,

00:43:11.846 --> 00:43:14.326 A:middle
grabbing those bits of
information off the devic,

00:43:14.796 --> 00:43:17.226 A:middle
and creating a name and putting
it back on to the device.

00:43:17.656 --> 00:43:21.126 A:middle
As you can see, my devices are
named Townships Schools iPad 1

00:43:21.126 --> 00:43:23.336 A:middle
through 5.

00:43:23.336 --> 00:43:24.646 A:middle
All these devices
are configured.

00:43:25.166 --> 00:43:31.226 A:middle
I have a brand-new cart of
devices I would like to add.

00:43:31.226 --> 00:43:35.106 A:middle
These are pads that are right
out of the box and almost ready

00:43:35.106 --> 00:43:36.806 A:middle
to go as soon as
Configurator is done with them.

00:43:37.436 --> 00:43:39.926 A:middle
The first thing that you'll
notice is this big white Device

00:43:39.966 --> 00:43:42.606 A:middle
icon, what that represents is

00:43:42.606 --> 00:43:44.656 A:middle
that these devices are
ready to be prepared.

00:43:44.716 --> 00:43:47.226 A:middle
I would like to show you
that prepare right now.

00:43:47.686 --> 00:43:49.436 A:middle
Let me click on one
of these devices.

00:43:51.066 --> 00:43:52.686 A:middle
Click on the Prepare
button in the toolbar.

00:43:53.596 --> 00:43:55.876 A:middle
In Configurator 2, there's
two prepare workflows.

00:43:56.226 --> 00:43:59.166 A:middle
One is manual, and the other
is the automated enrollment

00:43:59.166 --> 00:44:01.656 A:middle
that Todd talked about
earlier in the presentation.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:59.166 --> 00:44:01.656 A:middle
that Todd talked about
earlier in the presentation.

00:44:02.676 --> 00:44:04.056 A:middle
For this demonstration,

00:44:04.056 --> 00:44:07.416 A:middle
I'm going to do these
iPads using manual.

00:44:07.636 --> 00:44:08.646 A:middle
I'll click on Next.

00:44:09.666 --> 00:44:10.916 A:middle
Here is my opportunity

00:44:10.916 --> 00:44:13.166 A:middle
to manually enroll
the devices into MDM.

00:44:13.596 --> 00:44:15.306 A:middle
I don't have an MDM
server with me today,

00:44:15.306 --> 00:44:16.636 A:middle
so I will go ahead
and click on Next.

00:44:17.906 --> 00:44:19.626 A:middle
Here, Configurator is
asking me if I want

00:44:19.626 --> 00:44:21.676 A:middle
to supervise my devices
to my organization,

00:44:21.676 --> 00:44:23.706 A:middle
and I absolutely do
to take advantage

00:44:23.706 --> 00:44:26.126 A:middle
of the new iOS 9
supervise only features.

00:44:26.696 --> 00:44:27.386 A:middle
Click on Next.

00:44:28.336 --> 00:44:31.656 A:middle
This is the organization that is
associated with the supervision.

00:44:32.226 --> 00:44:32.806 A:middle
This looks good.

00:44:32.806 --> 00:44:37.436 A:middle
Next. And this final
pane is my opportunity

00:44:37.436 --> 00:44:39.716 A:middle
of skipping iOS Setup
Assistant panes

00:44:39.986 --> 00:44:42.426 A:middle
on the device once I hand
my device back to my users.

00:44:42.866 --> 00:44:46.676 A:middle
For this demonstration, I want
to not show any of the panes.

00:44:46.676 --> 00:44:48.456 A:middle
I'll go ahead and
click on Prepare.

00:44:48.866 --> 00:44:51.526 A:middle
Configurator is now preparing
and supervising these devices.

00:44:51.956 --> 00:44:55.196 A:middle
I still have to tag, add some
profiles, and add some apps

00:44:55.246 --> 00:44:59.106 A:middle
to this device, which
actually is a lengthy process.

00:44:59.526 --> 00:45:02.426 A:middle
So, what we did in Configurator
2 is automated this process

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:59.526 --> 00:45:02.426 A:middle
So, what we did in Configurator
2 is automated this process

00:45:02.426 --> 00:45:04.186 A:middle
with what we call blueprints.

00:45:04.516 --> 00:45:06.086 A:middle
I'll show you what a
blueprint is right now.

00:45:06.736 --> 00:45:08.846 A:middle
If I click on the Apply
button in the toolbar,

00:45:08.846 --> 00:45:11.816 A:middle
and click on Edit Blueprints,
Configurator takes you

00:45:11.816 --> 00:45:14.576 A:middle
into this special mode where
you can create a new blueprint,

00:45:14.996 --> 00:45:16.296 A:middle
and I'm going to do that.

00:45:16.486 --> 00:45:17.866 A:middle
Click New Blueprint.

00:45:18.436 --> 00:45:19.966 A:middle
Let me give it a
name I can remember.

00:45:26.016 --> 00:45:27.036 A:middle
And press Return.

00:45:27.926 --> 00:45:30.196 A:middle
Now, what's really cool
about these blueprints is

00:45:30.196 --> 00:45:31.796 A:middle
that they act just
like a device.

00:45:32.126 --> 00:45:34.706 A:middle
Anything that I can do
on a connected device,

00:45:34.706 --> 00:45:36.106 A:middle
I can actually do
on a blueprint.

00:45:36.436 --> 00:45:39.786 A:middle
What the blueprint does,
it records those actions,

00:45:39.786 --> 00:45:41.866 A:middle
and then later on I can
replay those actions.

00:45:42.226 --> 00:45:44.776 A:middle
Let me do the first
thing, which is prepare.

00:45:45.226 --> 00:45:46.286 A:middle
If I click on the blueprint,

00:45:46.986 --> 00:45:48.746 A:middle
I press on the Prepare
button in the toolbar.

00:45:49.536 --> 00:45:52.156 A:middle
Configurator offers me the
same view we had earlier

00:45:52.156 --> 00:45:53.406 A:middle
when we clicked Prepare.

00:45:53.556 --> 00:45:55.426 A:middle
Configurator remembered
my last options.

00:45:55.496 --> 00:45:57.816 A:middle
And these options are fine.

00:45:57.816 --> 00:46:00.606 A:middle
I am breeze through
these setup panes.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:57.816 --> 00:46:00.606 A:middle
I am breeze through
these setup panes.

00:46:01.846 --> 00:46:03.326 A:middle
Click on Next.

00:46:04.056 --> 00:46:05.336 A:middle
Until we get to prepare.

00:46:05.336 --> 00:46:09.346 A:middle
Now that the blueprint
is prepared,

00:46:09.346 --> 00:46:11.086 A:middle
I want to add some tags.

00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:13.926 A:middle
Click on the Tag
button in the toolbar.

00:46:14.936 --> 00:46:16.136 A:middle
Select a couple of tags.

00:46:16.796 --> 00:46:17.356 A:middle
Press Return.

00:46:18.136 --> 00:46:21.166 A:middle
You will immediately notice
the Blueprints label is updated

00:46:21.166 --> 00:46:22.236 A:middle
with my new tags.

00:46:23.996 --> 00:46:25.276 A:middle
I want to add an app.

00:46:26.116 --> 00:46:27.856 A:middle
Click the add button
in the toolbar.

00:46:28.816 --> 00:46:33.276 A:middle
Apps. Now what you see here
is all the VPP apps associated

00:46:33.276 --> 00:46:34.416 A:middle
with my VPP account.

00:46:34.906 --> 00:46:37.866 A:middle
I want to go ahead
and push the WWDC app

00:46:37.986 --> 00:46:39.906 A:middle
to a part of this blueprint.

00:46:39.906 --> 00:46:46.076 A:middle
I click on WWDC, Add Apps,
and then finally I want

00:46:46.076 --> 00:46:47.296 A:middle
to add my WiFi profile.

00:46:47.346 --> 00:46:50.136 A:middle
The same Add button, Profiles,

00:46:51.096 --> 00:46:54.416 A:middle
Configurator remembered the
last spot I was at for profile.

00:46:54.416 --> 00:46:58.236 A:middle
I'll click on my WiFi profile.

00:46:59.076 --> 00:47:01.066 A:middle
Add profiles.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:59.076 --> 00:47:01.066 A:middle
Add profiles.

00:47:01.066 --> 00:47:02.326 A:middle
Now, like inspecting the device,

00:47:02.326 --> 00:47:03.566 A:middle
you can also inspect
a blueprint.

00:47:03.566 --> 00:47:06.476 A:middle
If I double-click on this
blueprint, I'm presented

00:47:06.476 --> 00:47:08.526 A:middle
with this blueprint inspector.

00:47:08.886 --> 00:47:11.566 A:middle
Here you can see additional
information about the blueprint

00:47:11.796 --> 00:47:15.296 A:middle
such as its name, its
storage requirements,

00:47:16.016 --> 00:47:19.086 A:middle
here with the storage bar at
the top of this inspector,

00:47:19.486 --> 00:47:22.056 A:middle
as well as the prepare
options I highlighted earlier

00:47:22.056 --> 00:47:23.726 A:middle
and the tags that I've set.

00:47:24.416 --> 00:47:28.096 A:middle
Like a device inspector, you can
also inspect the apps associated

00:47:28.096 --> 00:47:31.196 A:middle
with this blueprint and
the profiles associated

00:47:31.196 --> 00:47:31.766 A:middle
with this blueprint.

00:47:33.386 --> 00:47:34.226 A:middle
Now I'm almost done.

00:47:34.226 --> 00:47:37.006 A:middle
I just need to rename
the devices associated

00:47:37.006 --> 00:47:37.586 A:middle
with this blueprint.

00:47:37.586 --> 00:47:38.606 A:middle
So I go back to Info.

00:47:40.196 --> 00:47:41.206 A:middle
Click on Actions.

00:47:42.596 --> 00:47:45.336 A:middle
Modify. Device Name.

00:47:46.096 --> 00:47:48.466 A:middle
Configurator remembered
my last rename options.

00:47:48.876 --> 00:47:51.266 A:middle
Those worked fine, so
I'll click on Rename.

00:47:51.676 --> 00:47:55.526 A:middle
You notice here in the blueprint
the device name options show

00:47:55.526 --> 00:47:55.896 A:middle
up here.

00:47:56.616 --> 00:47:57.626 A:middle
Great, this blueprint is done.

00:47:57.626 --> 00:48:00.816 A:middle
In the lower right-hand corner,
I can click on the Done button.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:57.626 --> 00:48:00.816 A:middle
In the lower right-hand corner,
I can click on the Done button.

00:48:03.096 --> 00:48:05.786 A:middle
Now I want to apply that
blueprint to these devices

00:48:05.786 --> 00:48:07.036 A:middle
that are ready to be prepared.

00:48:07.036 --> 00:48:08.516 A:middle
Let me select those devices.

00:48:10.126 --> 00:48:12.756 A:middle
Go back to that same Apply
button that we went to earlier.

00:48:13.456 --> 00:48:15.176 A:middle
Now you see an entry
for my blueprint.

00:48:15.976 --> 00:48:18.906 A:middle
If I tap on that entry,
Configurator is now going

00:48:18.906 --> 00:48:21.006 A:middle
through the actions I
saved in that blueprint

00:48:21.316 --> 00:48:22.736 A:middle
and replaying them
on to the devices.

00:48:23.276 --> 00:48:24.766 A:middle
This is Apple Configurator 2.

00:48:25.056 --> 00:48:25.806 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:48:26.436 --> 00:48:26.926 A:middle
Back to Todd.

[ Applause ]

00:48:35.046 --> 00:48:35.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TODD FERNANDEZ: Thank
you very much, Enrique.

00:48:36.936 --> 00:48:38.516 A:middle
So Enrique has showed you how

00:48:38.516 --> 00:48:40.656 A:middle
to configure devices using
Apple Configurator 2,

00:48:40.876 --> 00:48:42.676 A:middle
including installing VPP apps.

00:48:43.376 --> 00:48:44.866 A:middle
I'll talk more about
that in a moment.

00:48:45.386 --> 00:48:48.006 A:middle
You can create device tags
that travel with the devices

00:48:48.006 --> 00:48:50.646 A:middle
between multiple Configurator
stations using tags.

00:48:51.516 --> 00:48:54.856 A:middle
He showed you how to
build and use a blueprint

00:48:55.066 --> 00:48:59.046 A:middle
to create a custom workflow
and replay the set of actions

00:48:59.176 --> 00:49:03.966 A:middle
that you want on any
number of further devices.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

that you want on any
number of further devices.

00:49:04.046 --> 00:49:05.506 A:middle
However, there's even
more automation options

00:49:05.506 --> 00:49:06.556 A:middle
that we didn't show you here.

00:49:07.046 --> 00:49:08.846 A:middle
In addition to blueprints
in the UI,

00:49:09.486 --> 00:49:10.936 A:middle
there's also a command-line
tool.

00:49:11.396 --> 00:49:14.196 A:middle
There's a scripting library
and suite of automation actions

00:49:14.196 --> 00:49:17.156 A:middle
for you to easily integrate
Configurator's functionality

00:49:17.286 --> 00:49:17.976 A:middle
into your workflows.

00:49:21.446 --> 00:49:22.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; TODD FERNANDEZ:
You're in for a treat

00:49:22.666 --> 00:49:25.106 A:middle
because Sal Soghoian is
going to talk about that

00:49:25.106 --> 00:49:27.156 A:middle
on Thursday afternoon,
how to use Automator

00:49:27.156 --> 00:49:28.326 A:middle
and Configurator together

00:49:28.326 --> 00:49:30.386 A:middle
to automate your device
management workflows.

00:49:31.766 --> 00:49:34.416 A:middle
Enrique showed you a lot of
what Apple Configurator 2 can do

00:49:34.536 --> 00:49:35.426 A:middle
but there's more.

00:49:36.636 --> 00:49:40.926 A:middle
I mentioned multiple station
support, all of those profiles

00:49:40.926 --> 00:49:44.246 A:middle
that you can find anywhere on
your Mac can be saved in iCloud

00:49:44.246 --> 00:49:46.496 A:middle
in addition to other
Configurator settings.

00:49:47.286 --> 00:49:48.836 A:middle
I mentioned the automation
tools.

00:49:49.696 --> 00:49:52.476 A:middle
While Enrique showed you the
cool additions to renaming

00:49:52.776 --> 00:49:54.396 A:middle
that Apple Configurator 2 has,

00:49:54.736 --> 00:49:56.366 A:middle
there are also some great
enhancements to being able

00:49:56.366 --> 00:49:58.866 A:middle
to set wallpaper, which
is no longer a preference,

00:49:58.956 --> 00:50:01.326 A:middle
but can be done as a command
on any number of devices.

but can be done as a command
on any number of devices.

00:50:01.666 --> 00:50:03.776 A:middle
There are cool tricks
if you look

00:50:03.776 --> 00:50:04.976 A:middle
at the options in there as well.

00:50:06.296 --> 00:50:07.566 A:middle
Definitely check it out.

00:50:07.566 --> 00:50:10.906 A:middle
We released the beta yesterday,
and it's available for you

00:50:10.906 --> 00:50:12.436 A:middle
to download from
the Developer portal

00:50:12.436 --> 00:50:13.946 A:middle
and we will also
have it in the Lab.

00:50:14.526 --> 00:50:17.906 A:middle
That brings us to the end
of our fourth section.

00:50:19.636 --> 00:50:22.116 A:middle
And I just want to sum up
quickly for you administrators

00:50:22.276 --> 00:50:24.476 A:middle
that if you are using
wireless remote management,

00:50:24.476 --> 00:50:25.906 A:middle
use the Device Enrollment
Program

00:50:25.906 --> 00:50:28.456 A:middle
or Configurator using
automated enrollment

00:50:28.596 --> 00:50:31.666 A:middle
to get your devices enrolled
in MDM or use Configurator

00:50:31.776 --> 00:50:34.306 A:middle
to manage your devices if
you are not going to use MDM.

00:50:35.236 --> 00:50:37.716 A:middle
You can use VPP managed
distribution now not only

00:50:37.716 --> 00:50:40.926 A:middle
to distribute apps to
users but also to devices.

00:50:41.796 --> 00:50:44.346 A:middle
As I mentioned the Configurator
2 beta is available now.

00:50:45.586 --> 00:50:48.236 A:middle
Turning to developers,
again, you app developers,

00:50:48.236 --> 00:50:51.276 A:middle
please early next month in
iTunes Connect you will be able

00:50:51.276 --> 00:50:53.346 A:middle
to opt in to device
assignments for your apps.

00:50:54.256 --> 00:50:57.776 A:middle
MDM developers, please support
VPP managed distribution device

00:50:57.776 --> 00:50:59.766 A:middle
assignments, your customers
will appreciate that.
