&gt;&gt; OLIVIER BONNET: Good
afternoon and welcome

00:00:31.686 --> 00:00:34.416 A:middle
to Session 704 What's
New in CloudKit.

00:00:35.156 --> 00:00:36.246 A:middle
My name is Olivier.

00:00:36.246 --> 00:00:39.006 A:middle
I'm the Engineering Manager
for the iCloud Client teams.

00:00:39.976 --> 00:00:44.656 A:middle
So a year ago we introduced
CloudKits a brand new framework

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:48.476 A:middle
for you as developers to
harness of the power of iCloud.

00:00:49.156 --> 00:00:54.056 A:middle
We built a number of
the iOS 8 new features

00:00:54.056 --> 00:00:55.186 A:middle
on top of CloudKits.

00:00:55.526 --> 00:00:59.266 A:middle
Most visibly iCloud Drive and
iCloud Photo Library were built

00:00:59.736 --> 00:01:03.536 A:middle
from the ground up on top of
CloudKit but Mail Drop, HomeKit,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.736 --> 00:01:03.536 A:middle
from the ground up on top of
CloudKit but Mail Drop, HomeKit,

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:07.226 A:middle
Safari history syncing, and
call history syncing were also

00:01:07.226 --> 00:01:08.056 A:middle
using CloudKit.

00:01:08.576 --> 00:01:12.416 A:middle
So a year later,
what have we seen?

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:17.106 A:middle
We have uploaded over
240 billion records.

00:01:18.176 --> 00:01:22.426 A:middle
We saved over 250 petabytes
of assets and that's coming

00:01:22.426 --> 00:01:25.156 A:middle
from over 300 million users.

00:01:26.516 --> 00:01:28.326 A:middle
So really, we couldn't
be happier

00:01:28.326 --> 00:01:32.716 A:middle
with how this has turned
out, with how reliable

00:01:32.716 --> 00:01:34.566 A:middle
and stable CloudKit
has been for us.

00:01:35.356 --> 00:01:39.856 A:middle
So this year, we're going to add
a couple more features to that.

00:01:40.476 --> 00:01:44.006 A:middle
Notes is now using
CloudKit on iOS,

00:01:44.276 --> 00:01:47.716 A:middle
and OS X to synchronize your
notes between your devices.

00:01:48.936 --> 00:01:50.806 A:middle
The new app we introduces
yesterday,

00:01:50.806 --> 00:01:55.146 A:middle
News is entirely built on
the CloudKit public database.

00:01:56.296 --> 00:01:59.506 A:middle
Even the WWDC app is now
using CloudKit this year.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:00.016 --> 00:02:02.276 A:middle
And last but not
least iCloud Backup,

00:02:03.016 --> 00:02:06.406 A:middle
was ported in iOS
9 to use CloudKit.

00:02:07.216 --> 00:02:09.636 A:middle
So this is actually -- this
one is actually a bigger deal

00:02:09.636 --> 00:02:12.306 A:middle
than it seems because iCloud
Backup is our biggest service

00:02:12.786 --> 00:02:16.396 A:middle
in terms of number of users,
amount of data, and the number

00:02:16.396 --> 00:02:19.796 A:middle
of requests per seconds.

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:22.776 A:middle
We've also heard some good
feedback from you as developers.

00:02:23.316 --> 00:02:26.616 A:middle
For instance, from Hipstamatic,
"With CloudKit, we were able

00:02:26.616 --> 00:02:28.066 A:middle
to focus on building our app,

00:02:28.216 --> 00:02:30.036 A:middle
and even squeeze
in a few extras."

00:02:30.656 --> 00:02:33.036 A:middle
So that is exactly
why we built CloudKit.

00:02:33.876 --> 00:02:37.386 A:middle
To enable you as developers to
focus on building great apps,

00:02:37.536 --> 00:02:40.596 A:middle
building awesome user
experience, without having

00:02:40.596 --> 00:02:43.286 A:middle
to set up a server, without
having to operate it,

00:02:43.676 --> 00:02:46.486 A:middle
without having to
be on call 24/7.

00:02:47.956 --> 00:02:52.306 A:middle
AgileBits is using CloudKit to
synchronize one password data.

00:02:52.306 --> 00:02:53.326 A:middle
They're happy with it.

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:56.086 A:middle
Here's what they're saying:
"CloudKit is very fast,

00:02:56.086 --> 00:02:59.786 A:middle
efficient, and makes it easy to
detect and troubleshoot errors."

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:00.486 --> 00:03:05.586 A:middle
Again, that was one of our
design goals with CloudKit.

00:03:06.106 --> 00:03:09.286 A:middle
If there's an error in the
daemon, on the network,

00:03:09.286 --> 00:03:12.356 A:middle
or on the server side, we will
return that error to your app

00:03:12.746 --> 00:03:15.786 A:middle
and your app is in
charge of handling it,

00:03:15.786 --> 00:03:19.126 A:middle
retrying it, if it makes sense.

00:03:19.316 --> 00:03:23.076 A:middle
Last but not least, IconFactory:
"One of the best parts

00:03:23.076 --> 00:03:26.236 A:middle
about CloudKit is there's no
complicated sign-in process

00:03:26.236 --> 00:03:26.846 A:middle
or setup."

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:29.636 A:middle
Again that was one of out goals.

00:03:30.056 --> 00:03:34.406 A:middle
Make it possible to enable
completely seamless user

00:03:34.406 --> 00:03:36.726 A:middle
experience, no account creation,

00:03:36.726 --> 00:03:38.926 A:middle
no password to enter
or remember.

00:03:40.676 --> 00:03:42.496 A:middle
In addition to this
good feedback,

00:03:42.496 --> 00:03:45.096 A:middle
we also heard some questions
from you as developers.

00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:47.326 A:middle
So last year, we
introduced CloudKit.

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:49.096 A:middle
We said it was free with limits.

00:03:49.876 --> 00:03:52.746 A:middle
And so we get some questions
like, okay, what does it mean?

00:03:52.746 --> 00:03:55.276 A:middle
What if my app reached
the limits?

00:03:55.816 --> 00:04:00.316 A:middle
How much will I have
to pay Apple?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:55.816 --> 00:04:00.316 A:middle
How much will I have
to pay Apple?

00:04:00.526 --> 00:04:03.126 A:middle
Second question we got
immediately last year is like,

00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:04.826 A:middle
okay, but what about the web?

00:04:05.086 --> 00:04:07.576 A:middle
What if I have a web app
and I wanted to be able

00:04:07.576 --> 00:04:12.966 A:middle
to access the same data as
my iOS and OS X CloudKit app.

00:04:13.876 --> 00:04:15.436 A:middle
To talk about both of those,

00:04:15.436 --> 00:04:17.156 A:middle
I would like to hand
it over to Eric.

00:04:17.526 --> 00:04:19.646 A:middle
Eric is the manager for
the iCloud Server team.

00:04:20.516 --> 00:04:25.586 A:middle
[Applause].

00:04:26.086 --> 00:04:26.636 A:middle
&gt;&gt; ERIC KRUGLER: Thank you.

00:04:26.726 --> 00:04:27.826 A:middle
Well, thank you, Olivier.

00:04:28.016 --> 00:04:30.536 A:middle
It's terrific to be here
this afternoon to talk to you

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:32.166 A:middle
about what's new in CloudKit.

00:04:32.836 --> 00:04:34.786 A:middle
Let's start by answering
that first question.

00:04:34.786 --> 00:04:35.606 A:middle
What does it cost?

00:04:36.186 --> 00:04:39.226 A:middle
We are going to look at CloudKit
usage and pricing but to get

00:04:39.226 --> 00:04:40.136 A:middle
into that, we first need

00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:42.346 A:middle
to understand the
CloudKit architecture.

00:04:42.746 --> 00:04:46.556 A:middle
So when you use CloudKit,
all of your data is stored

00:04:46.556 --> 00:04:47.916 A:middle
in your CloudKit container.

00:04:48.266 --> 00:04:50.256 A:middle
This is the place where
all of your data resides

00:04:50.536 --> 00:04:52.596 A:middle
and you can store that
data, in two different ways.

00:04:53.136 --> 00:04:58.226 A:middle
One is as a private database
and two is as a public database.

00:04:59.026 --> 00:05:02.036 A:middle
Now a private database is
the user's private data.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.026 --> 00:05:02.036 A:middle
Now a private database is
the user's private data.

00:05:02.976 --> 00:05:05.226 A:middle
This example would be
the iCloud Photo Library.

00:05:05.396 --> 00:05:08.586 A:middle
All the photos that you
take are stored in CloudKit

00:05:08.996 --> 00:05:11.336 A:middle
and accessible by the user
and managed by the user,

00:05:11.486 --> 00:05:14.046 A:middle
and because it's the
user's private data it comes

00:05:14.046 --> 00:05:17.186 A:middle
out of the user's storage
quota, not the developer's.

00:05:17.186 --> 00:05:19.946 A:middle
Now when we look at
the public database,

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:22.146 A:middle
this is application's
public data.

00:05:22.696 --> 00:05:25.316 A:middle
A great example of this
is the new News app

00:05:25.496 --> 00:05:27.146 A:middle
that we just announced
yesterday,

00:05:27.606 --> 00:05:30.516 A:middle
where all of those news articles
are actually distributed

00:05:30.516 --> 00:05:33.716 A:middle
to all the news applications
via CloudKit public database

00:05:34.306 --> 00:05:37.016 A:middle
and because it's the
application's public data this

00:05:37.016 --> 00:05:39.436 A:middle
comes out of the
developer's storage quota.

00:05:39.846 --> 00:05:42.936 A:middle
So when we talk about pricing
and we talk about usage,

00:05:42.986 --> 00:05:45.976 A:middle
we are really talking about
public database usage.

00:05:46.766 --> 00:05:47.766 A:middle
So let's see what that means.

00:05:47.766 --> 00:05:51.666 A:middle
For our public database
offering,

00:05:52.066 --> 00:05:53.216 A:middle
we have a free offering.

00:05:54.106 --> 00:05:57.436 A:middle
We also have a fee structure if
you exceed those free limits.

00:05:58.166 --> 00:05:59.856 A:middle
And we also have usage data.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:00.756 --> 00:06:03.956 A:middle
Let's look at the free offering.

00:06:03.956 --> 00:06:08.626 A:middle
So you have to store assets in
the cloud, and we track that

00:06:09.246 --> 00:06:11.066 A:middle
and we give you ten
gigabytes to start.

00:06:11.806 --> 00:06:13.996 A:middle
So if you have no users, you
are just starting development,

00:06:14.376 --> 00:06:14.966 A:middle
10 gigs.

00:06:15.716 --> 00:06:18.296 A:middle
Now as your user
population grows,

00:06:18.296 --> 00:06:21.496 A:middle
as your application becomes more
popular, we are going to grow

00:06:21.496 --> 00:06:24.256 A:middle
with you and we are going to
add an additional 250 megs

00:06:24.256 --> 00:06:27.176 A:middle
for every single user that is
using your application for free

00:06:27.176 --> 00:06:29.186 A:middle
and we will grow that up

00:06:29.296 --> 00:06:32.046 A:middle
to an astonishing 1
petabyte of storage.

00:06:34.156 --> 00:06:36.246 A:middle
Likewise, for the database side,

00:06:36.246 --> 00:06:38.716 A:middle
where you store your record
data, we will start you

00:06:38.716 --> 00:06:42.056 A:middle
with 100 megs and we will
grow that at 2.5 megs per user

00:06:42.056 --> 00:06:44.136 A:middle
and we will go up to
10 terabytes for free.

00:06:45.316 --> 00:06:48.956 A:middle
Now in addition to storage,
we also have data transfer.

00:06:49.756 --> 00:06:50.786 A:middle
So as you're uploading

00:06:50.786 --> 00:06:53.186 A:middle
and downloading your assets
you are consuming bandwidth

00:06:53.236 --> 00:06:56.336 A:middle
and we will start
you with 2 gigabytes

00:06:56.596 --> 00:06:59.106 A:middle
of data transfer per
month in and out.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:00.076 --> 00:07:02.856 A:middle
And like the others we will grow
that as you have more users.

00:07:02.856 --> 00:07:05.066 A:middle
So we will add an extra 50
megs per user per month.

00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:08.996 A:middle
And we will allow you to
grow up to 200 terabytes

00:07:09.096 --> 00:07:11.936 A:middle
of data transfer per
month all for free.

00:07:12.686 --> 00:07:15.856 A:middle
Now for database, it's
a little different.

00:07:16.356 --> 00:07:19.106 A:middle
We actually measure it on
a request per second basis.

00:07:19.106 --> 00:07:20.716 A:middle
So we are going to start you

00:07:20.716 --> 00:07:22.976 A:middle
at 40 requests per second,
which is very large.

00:07:23.816 --> 00:07:25.486 A:middle
And just like the
others, we will grow

00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:27.486 A:middle
with the number of users.

00:07:27.856 --> 00:07:29.126 A:middle
And we will do that
in increments

00:07:29.126 --> 00:07:31.976 A:middle
of 10 requests per second
for each 100,000 users

00:07:32.356 --> 00:07:36.386 A:middle
up to 400 requests per second
for free, and what's important

00:07:36.386 --> 00:07:38.386 A:middle
to note about the
request per second is

00:07:38.386 --> 00:07:39.686 A:middle
that it's actually
a throttle limit.

00:07:40.346 --> 00:07:42.976 A:middle
So if for some reason your
application hits these limits,

00:07:42.976 --> 00:07:46.176 A:middle
we will actually send you
back a throttling error back

00:07:46.176 --> 00:07:47.926 A:middle
to your client to tell
you you've hit the limits.

00:07:48.476 --> 00:07:50.696 A:middle
And then we will talk
in a bit about how

00:07:50.696 --> 00:07:52.666 A:middle
to make sure that
doesn't happen.

00:07:53.496 --> 00:07:54.706 A:middle
All right.

00:07:54.796 --> 00:07:56.746 A:middle
Now, if you do go
over those limits,

00:07:56.866 --> 00:07:58.226 A:middle
there is a way to pay for more.

00:07:58.546 --> 00:08:00.216 A:middle
And that's our public
database fees.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.546 --> 00:08:00.216 A:middle
And that's our public
database fees.

00:08:01.266 --> 00:08:03.406 A:middle
Now, this is over and above
what we give you for free.

00:08:03.406 --> 00:08:06.476 A:middle
So it's the incremental delta
between what you get for free,

00:08:06.836 --> 00:08:07.706 A:middle
and what you are using.

00:08:08.456 --> 00:08:11.536 A:middle
So for assets, it's $0.03
per gigabyte per month,

00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:14.136 A:middle
for database, $3.00
per gig per month.

00:08:14.876 --> 00:08:16.066 A:middle
On the transfer side,

00:08:16.276 --> 00:08:18.416 A:middle
for transferring
assets $0.10 per gig

00:08:19.146 --> 00:08:20.886 A:middle
and on the database
request rates,

00:08:21.226 --> 00:08:23.946 A:middle
we'll add an extra 10
requests per second for $100,

00:08:24.276 --> 00:08:26.726 A:middle
and so you can increment that
number up to get to the level

00:08:26.726 --> 00:08:29.106 A:middle
that allows your
application to work smoothly

00:08:29.106 --> 00:08:30.266 A:middle
if you hit the free limits.

00:08:30.796 --> 00:08:35.726 A:middle
And, of course, push is free.

00:08:36.035 --> 00:08:40.166 A:middle
Okay? So now let's
take a look at a demo

00:08:40.405 --> 00:08:42.285 A:middle
of the CloudKit calculator.

00:08:42.385 --> 00:08:46.196 A:middle
This is on
developer.apple.com/cloudkit.

00:08:46.196 --> 00:08:47.916 A:middle
You can play around with
this if you haven't already.

00:08:47.946 --> 00:08:50.526 A:middle
I'm going to invite
Ramiro Calvo to help drive,

00:08:50.526 --> 00:08:52.696 A:middle
because apparently I can drive
and talk at the same time.

00:08:53.176 --> 00:08:57.046 A:middle
And he's going to help
us walk through this.

00:08:57.046 --> 00:09:00.916 A:middle
If you go to the calculator,
you notice that right now,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:57.046 --> 00:09:00.916 A:middle
If you go to the calculator,
you notice that right now,

00:09:00.996 --> 00:09:04.366 A:middle
we have zero active users.

00:09:04.666 --> 00:09:10.516 A:middle
Okay? And the numbers that you
see beneath it tell you how much

00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:11.876 A:middle
storage we are getting
to you for free.

00:09:11.986 --> 00:09:13.996 A:middle
For start, this matches
what we just talked about.

00:09:13.996 --> 00:09:15.486 A:middle
There's 10 gigs of
asset storage,

00:09:15.486 --> 00:09:19.236 A:middle
100 megs of database storage, 2
gigs of data transfer per month,

00:09:19.396 --> 00:09:20.786 A:middle
and 40 requests per second.

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:23.666 A:middle
Now let's say my
application starts taking off

00:09:23.666 --> 00:09:24.986 A:middle
and I have 100,000 users.

00:09:25.406 --> 00:09:27.716 A:middle
So we're going to
grow that to 100,000,

00:09:28.156 --> 00:09:30.496 A:middle
and you will notice we gave
you a lot more storage,

00:09:31.086 --> 00:09:33.386 A:middle
and if you look below
at the bottom there,

00:09:33.436 --> 00:09:35.946 A:middle
and Ramiro maybe you can scroll
up a little bit, you're going

00:09:35.946 --> 00:09:41.186 A:middle
to notice that the
cost is actually $0.

00:09:41.666 --> 00:09:43.316 A:middle
Ramiro is it possible to
scroll it up a little bit.

00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:43.636 A:middle
Thank you.

00:09:44.746 --> 00:09:46.626 A:middle
Okay? So we have $0 cost.

00:09:47.486 --> 00:09:49.946 A:middle
Now let's say we go up
to half a million users.

00:09:53.776 --> 00:09:56.736 A:middle
Okay? Now, once again we
have a lot of storage.

00:09:56.736 --> 00:09:58.596 A:middle
Now we are up to 125 terabytes.

00:09:58.856 --> 00:10:02.566 A:middle
We're still growing and the
cost to you is still zero.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:58.856 --> 00:10:02.566 A:middle
We're still growing and the
cost to you is still zero.

00:10:03.606 --> 00:10:04.856 A:middle
Let's take it to
a million users.

00:10:06.236 --> 00:10:08.176 A:middle
Okay? So now we got a
lot of users in here.

00:10:08.796 --> 00:10:10.226 A:middle
We got a lot of storage.

00:10:10.226 --> 00:10:12.586 A:middle
We are up to 250
terabytes of data.

00:10:12.806 --> 00:10:15.126 A:middle
Lots of requests per second.

00:10:15.236 --> 00:10:15.916 A:middle
It's still free.

00:10:16.446 --> 00:10:18.016 A:middle
Let's take it to
4 million users.

00:10:18.536 --> 00:10:22.066 A:middle
Okay. So now we are at 4
million users and you are going

00:10:22.066 --> 00:10:23.346 A:middle
to see some very
large numbers here.

00:10:24.246 --> 00:10:27.496 A:middle
We are up to the petabyte
of storage, 10 terabytes

00:10:27.886 --> 00:10:31.376 A:middle
of database storage,
200 terabytes per month

00:10:31.376 --> 00:10:33.996 A:middle
of data transfer,
this is a lot of data,

00:10:33.996 --> 00:10:36.126 A:middle
and all of this still
costs you nothing.

00:10:36.846 --> 00:10:39.126 A:middle
Now if you recall from
the pricing slide,

00:10:39.726 --> 00:10:41.086 A:middle
at some point, we hit a limit.

00:10:41.366 --> 00:10:42.776 A:middle
And that limit looks
about right here.

00:10:42.916 --> 00:10:44.426 A:middle
You got about a petabyte
of storage.

00:10:44.426 --> 00:10:46.026 A:middle
That's what we said was
the max you can get to.

00:10:46.026 --> 00:10:49.716 A:middle
So, as we add more users then
there must be some costs.

00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:51.036 A:middle
Let's take it to
5 million users.

00:10:51.546 --> 00:10:56.696 A:middle
And the cost here is --
well, it's still free.

00:10:57.546 --> 00:10:59.206 A:middle
So what's going on here?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:00.016 --> 00:11:03.986 A:middle
Well, if your application on
average uses less per user

00:11:03.986 --> 00:11:06.106 A:middle
that we give you, it
still costs you nothing.

00:11:06.736 --> 00:11:07.826 A:middle
And because it's an average,

00:11:07.826 --> 00:11:10.316 A:middle
that means that some users
may use more than the average,

00:11:10.376 --> 00:11:12.666 A:middle
and some may use less and
that's perfectly fine.

00:11:12.976 --> 00:11:14.146 A:middle
It still costs you nothing.

00:11:14.536 --> 00:11:16.576 A:middle
So we could take this all the
way up to 10 million here,

00:11:17.016 --> 00:11:20.186 A:middle
and demonstrate that it still
costs you nothing, all right?

00:11:20.296 --> 00:11:23.776 A:middle
If you just architect your
application correctly to stay

00:11:23.776 --> 00:11:25.696 A:middle
within the free limits
that we give you.

00:11:25.696 --> 00:11:26.516 A:middle
All right?

00:11:26.516 --> 00:11:29.556 A:middle
So that's how we calculate
things, use the calculator

00:11:29.556 --> 00:11:30.606 A:middle
if you would like
more information.

00:11:31.206 --> 00:11:31.866 A:middle
Thanks Ramiro.

00:11:33.516 --> 00:11:39.756 A:middle
[Applause]

00:11:40.256 --> 00:11:40.906 A:middle
All right.

00:11:41.016 --> 00:11:43.106 A:middle
The next question is how do
I know how much I'm using?

00:11:43.446 --> 00:11:45.646 A:middle
The CloudKit Dashboard
is the place

00:11:45.646 --> 00:11:46.856 A:middle
where we put this information.

00:11:47.076 --> 00:11:49.516 A:middle
The Dashboard is a web
application that you get

00:11:49.516 --> 00:11:52.076 A:middle
to at developer.apple.com.

00:11:52.116 --> 00:11:54.146 A:middle
It's a place that you get
to look at your container

00:11:54.446 --> 00:11:58.596 A:middle
and you get to do things like
manage your record types,

00:11:58.666 --> 00:12:01.066 A:middle
manage whether they are in
development or production,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.666 --> 00:12:01.066 A:middle
manage whether they are in
development or production,

00:12:01.976 --> 00:12:03.906 A:middle
and we have added some
new functionality.

00:12:04.486 --> 00:12:07.556 A:middle
So if you take a look
at what we've added,

00:12:07.726 --> 00:12:10.356 A:middle
there's a new section
called Usage.

00:12:10.966 --> 00:12:12.586 A:middle
And you can go there
and take a look

00:12:12.586 --> 00:12:15.036 A:middle
at how your application
container is performing.

00:12:16.776 --> 00:12:19.036 A:middle
If we drill in, we have a couple

00:12:19.036 --> 00:12:20.176 A:middle
of different ways
to look at the data.

00:12:20.176 --> 00:12:23.306 A:middle
We can look at it at a daily
level or a monthly level.

00:12:23.766 --> 00:12:28.376 A:middle
And if you look at the daily
information, the very top thing

00:12:28.376 --> 00:12:30.636 A:middle
on the graphs is
the number of users

00:12:30.636 --> 00:12:31.936 A:middle
and this is really important

00:12:32.296 --> 00:12:34.906 A:middle
because we calculate how
much free stuff we give you,

00:12:34.906 --> 00:12:36.066 A:middle
based on the numbers you have.

00:12:36.066 --> 00:12:37.396 A:middle
So you want to look
at that first.

00:12:38.396 --> 00:12:40.066 A:middle
Now, you'll also
notice on the right,

00:12:40.636 --> 00:12:42.076 A:middle
you have some dashed
lines over this

00:12:42.076 --> 00:12:44.916 A:middle
because what we are giving you
is two months worth of data,

00:12:44.986 --> 00:12:46.956 A:middle
the prior month and
the current month.

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:48.826 A:middle
The current month,
depending on where you are at,

00:12:48.826 --> 00:12:50.376 A:middle
some of that is going
to be a forecast.

00:12:50.686 --> 00:12:52.786 A:middle
And we're going to
forecast that for you based

00:12:52.786 --> 00:12:55.136 A:middle
on the prior activity
of your container.

00:12:56.476 --> 00:12:58.616 A:middle
Now, below this,
is another graph,

00:12:58.616 --> 00:13:00.866 A:middle
which shows our requests
per second and day by day,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:58.616 --> 00:13:00.866 A:middle
which shows our requests
per second and day by day,

00:13:00.866 --> 00:13:03.686 A:middle
we show you what the peak
request per second we're seeing

00:13:03.686 --> 00:13:04.656 A:middle
on any given day is.

00:13:04.656 --> 00:13:09.836 A:middle
Now you can also select monthly
and if you choose monthly,

00:13:09.946 --> 00:13:12.686 A:middle
you're going to get a
12-month view month by month

00:13:12.966 --> 00:13:14.496 A:middle
of the activity of
your application,

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:17.246 A:middle
and the current month
is typically going to be

00:13:17.246 --> 00:13:19.966 A:middle
in a forecast where
it shows a dashed line

00:13:20.016 --> 00:13:21.716 A:middle
and basically what we
expect it's going to be

00:13:21.716 --> 00:13:22.516 A:middle
for the current month.

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:25.846 A:middle
Now, let's scroll down to look
at a couple of other graphs.

00:13:27.026 --> 00:13:29.586 A:middle
Here's database storage,
as well as asset storage.

00:13:30.286 --> 00:13:31.936 A:middle
And you'll notice
something different here.

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.006 A:middle
You will see two lines.

00:13:33.136 --> 00:13:35.656 A:middle
There's a red line on top
and a yellow line just below.

00:13:36.086 --> 00:13:39.876 A:middle
The red line represents
the amount of free storage

00:13:39.876 --> 00:13:40.646 A:middle
that we are giving you.

00:13:40.646 --> 00:13:44.376 A:middle
And the yellow line represents
how much you are actually using.

00:13:45.056 --> 00:13:47.256 A:middle
So the game all of you
guys get to play is how

00:13:47.256 --> 00:13:50.766 A:middle
to keep the yellow line
beneath the red line, right?

00:13:50.856 --> 00:13:53.486 A:middle
The way that you can actually
see this information is

00:13:53.486 --> 00:13:56.586 A:middle
by clicking over here on
the section on the right

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:57.806 A:middle
where the quota box is.

00:13:57.806 --> 00:13:58.856 A:middle
It's off by default.

00:13:58.856 --> 00:14:00.116 A:middle
You can just turn
it on if you like.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:58.856 --> 00:14:00.116 A:middle
You can just turn
it on if you like.

00:14:00.596 --> 00:14:02.556 A:middle
The reason it is off by
default is because we give you

00:14:02.556 --> 00:14:05.966 A:middle
so much free storage, if you
click that, the scale changes

00:14:05.966 --> 00:14:08.766 A:middle
and basically your usage looks
like a flat line relative

00:14:08.766 --> 00:14:10.146 A:middle
to the amount of free
storage that we give you.

00:14:11.106 --> 00:14:12.346 A:middle
So please go ahead
and try that out.

00:14:13.746 --> 00:14:16.066 A:middle
So the CloudKit Dashboard
provides two things.

00:14:16.736 --> 00:14:19.986 A:middle
It's a new section to
keep track of usage data

00:14:20.126 --> 00:14:21.796 A:middle
and also give you
the free limits.

00:14:22.496 --> 00:14:27.516 A:middle
And it's available now in beta
release at developer.apple.com.

00:14:27.516 --> 00:14:28.756 A:middle
So if you already
have a container,

00:14:28.756 --> 00:14:31.476 A:middle
you can go there today and
you can see the usage data

00:14:32.146 --> 00:14:32.856 A:middle
on the Dashboard.

00:14:38.356 --> 00:14:39.396 A:middle
All right.

00:14:39.396 --> 00:14:41.916 A:middle
The second question that
was asked is what about web?

00:14:42.556 --> 00:14:44.146 A:middle
Well, I'm pleased
to introduce you

00:14:44.256 --> 00:14:46.886 A:middle
to the new CloudKit
Web Services.

00:14:47.416 --> 00:14:48.076 A:middle
This is the way --

00:14:49.516 --> 00:14:54.556 A:middle
[Applause].

00:14:55.056 --> 00:14:55.286 A:middle
Yeah, all right!

00:14:55.366 --> 00:14:57.866 A:middle
This is the way that you
can take your amazing iOS

00:14:57.866 --> 00:15:00.576 A:middle
and OS X applications and you
can extend them to the web.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:57.866 --> 00:15:00.576 A:middle
and OS X applications and you
can extend them to the web.

00:15:01.476 --> 00:15:02.546 A:middle
So how does this work?

00:15:03.266 --> 00:15:04.716 A:middle
Well, first lets talk
about the features.

00:15:04.716 --> 00:15:09.016 A:middle
You get a full CloudKit
API via JSON and HTTPS,

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:12.346 A:middle
we also provide CloudKit
JS Library

00:15:12.346 --> 00:15:13.806 A:middle
which is absolutely the best way

00:15:13.856 --> 00:15:15.696 A:middle
to quickly create
web applications,

00:15:16.566 --> 00:15:19.126 A:middle
and we provide Web Sign in
with Apple ID is the way

00:15:19.126 --> 00:15:20.606 A:middle
that your users will
authenticate

00:15:20.606 --> 00:15:22.566 A:middle
when they use your web app.

00:15:24.496 --> 00:15:25.566 A:middle
Now, how does this work?

00:15:25.566 --> 00:15:30.116 A:middle
If you look today, you'll
see your application running

00:15:30.256 --> 00:15:32.146 A:middle
on iOS and OS X.

00:15:32.146 --> 00:15:34.076 A:middle
It interacts with
CloudKit the framework,

00:15:34.496 --> 00:15:36.946 A:middle
which behind the scenes talks
to our CloudKit servers.

00:15:38.276 --> 00:15:42.186 A:middle
What we have introduced
today is the ability for you

00:15:42.186 --> 00:15:43.886 A:middle
to create your own
web application,

00:15:43.886 --> 00:15:47.896 A:middle
running in a web browser and
talking over JSON and HTTPS,

00:15:48.746 --> 00:15:51.666 A:middle
to our CloudKit Web Services
which lets you then talk

00:15:51.766 --> 00:15:54.256 A:middle
to the same exact
CloudKit servers

00:15:54.626 --> 00:15:57.526 A:middle
that your native applications
are talking to on iOS and OS X.

00:15:57.526 --> 00:16:00.726 A:middle
Now, it's important to
understand about the JSON

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:57.526 --> 00:16:00.726 A:middle
Now, it's important to
understand about the JSON

00:16:00.726 --> 00:16:04.026 A:middle
and the HTTPS piece of this,
it's just a specification.

00:16:04.706 --> 00:16:05.576 A:middle
There's no code.

00:16:06.206 --> 00:16:08.006 A:middle
Effectively, it's up to
you as a developer to look

00:16:08.006 --> 00:16:09.116 A:middle
at that specification.

00:16:09.746 --> 00:16:12.526 A:middle
You get to construct your own
end points, hitting endpoints.

00:16:12.836 --> 00:16:16.216 A:middle
You get to create your URLs and
construct your JSONs that goes

00:16:16.216 --> 00:16:19.426 A:middle
in the bodies that go up in
a request, you get back JSON

00:16:19.426 --> 00:16:22.436 A:middle
in responses, you parse that,
you deal with asset uploads

00:16:22.436 --> 00:16:24.766 A:middle
and downloads, retry
logic and on and on.

00:16:25.216 --> 00:16:28.846 A:middle
But a much better way to do
this is using the CloudKit

00:16:29.166 --> 00:16:30.296 A:middle
JS framework.

00:16:30.996 --> 00:16:34.836 A:middle
CloudKit JS gives you a
JavaScript API that you can use

00:16:35.016 --> 00:16:38.126 A:middle
that shields you from all
the complexities of the HTTPS

00:16:38.126 --> 00:16:40.676 A:middle
and JSON protocol
that sits behind it.

00:16:41.046 --> 00:16:43.856 A:middle
And you can use either one,
but you are probably crazy

00:16:43.856 --> 00:16:44.656 A:middle
if you go the other route.

00:16:44.656 --> 00:16:46.806 A:middle
So please use CloudKit JS.

00:16:47.896 --> 00:16:49.206 A:middle
So what does this give you?

00:16:49.466 --> 00:16:51.026 A:middle
Well all right, it
gives you full public

00:16:51.026 --> 00:16:52.436 A:middle
and private database access.

00:16:53.036 --> 00:16:54.846 A:middle
It gives you all those
record applications.

00:16:55.316 --> 00:16:57.266 A:middle
It lets you upload
and download assets.

00:16:57.736 --> 00:16:59.566 A:middle
It lets you execute queries.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:00.406 --> 00:17:03.086 A:middle
It even lets you do
subscriptions and notifications,

00:17:03.536 --> 00:17:06.976 A:middle
which means that I can actually
get an asynchronous event

00:17:07.076 --> 00:17:09.726 A:middle
into my web application,
just like you get pushes

00:17:09.935 --> 00:17:12.406 A:middle
to tell you something has
changed or to notify you

00:17:12.526 --> 00:17:14.476 A:middle
of some other event,
so you don't have

00:17:14.476 --> 00:17:16.796 A:middle
to have users hitting the
refresh button or pulling

00:17:16.796 --> 00:17:17.896 A:middle
from your web application.

00:17:18.925 --> 00:17:20.586 A:middle
It also has user
discoverability,

00:17:21.445 --> 00:17:23.876 A:middle
and it has the ability to answer
the question what's changed

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:26.695 A:middle
since within custom zones
which gives you sync semantics.

00:17:27.346 --> 00:17:31.336 A:middle
In short, what this gives
you is full compatibility

00:17:31.336 --> 00:17:32.806 A:middle
and capability as what you get

00:17:33.186 --> 00:17:40.316 A:middle
on the native CloudKit
on iOS and OS X.

00:17:40.836 --> 00:17:44.896 A:middle
Now, CloudKit JS, as I mentioned
before is the absolute best way

00:17:44.896 --> 00:17:46.196 A:middle
to develop web applications.

00:17:46.196 --> 00:17:47.246 A:middle
It's a JavaScript API.

00:17:48.296 --> 00:17:50.756 A:middle
It matches the native
CloudKit API as much

00:17:50.756 --> 00:17:52.746 A:middle
as you can make JavaScript
match Objective-C,

00:17:52.746 --> 00:17:54.456 A:middle
but you know we did our
best, it's pretty close.

00:17:55.106 --> 00:17:56.566 A:middle
There's no intermediate servers.

00:17:56.566 --> 00:17:59.316 A:middle
So you can create your
JavaScript application

00:17:59.626 --> 00:18:02.266 A:middle
and you can talk directly
to the CloudKit, you know --

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.626 --> 00:18:02.266 A:middle
and you can talk directly
to the CloudKit, you know --

00:18:02.266 --> 00:18:06.536 A:middle
the CloudKit Web Service behind
the scenes and you don't have

00:18:06.536 --> 00:18:08.606 A:middle
to run your own servers
or anything in the middle

00:18:08.936 --> 00:18:12.236 A:middle
and it's how we built
the new Notes web app

00:18:13.026 --> 00:18:15.606 A:middle
that you saw demonstrated
the other day.

00:18:15.926 --> 00:18:20.966 A:middle
And what I would like to do is
have Ramiro Calvo join me again.

00:18:21.116 --> 00:18:22.146 A:middle
We're going to give you a demo

00:18:22.146 --> 00:18:25.836 A:middle
of the new Notes web app
based on CloudKit JS.

00:18:32.476 --> 00:18:33.106 A:middle
All right.

00:18:33.106 --> 00:18:35.576 A:middle
So we are going to
start at icloud.com.

00:18:35.576 --> 00:18:36.536 A:middle
This is our spring board.

00:18:36.536 --> 00:18:38.326 A:middle
There's a bunch of web
apps sitting here already.

00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:42.006 A:middle
You'll notice some familiar ones
we have Photos and iCloud Drive.

00:18:42.396 --> 00:18:43.466 A:middle
Those are two applications

00:18:43.466 --> 00:18:45.626 A:middle
that already exist
on top of CloudKit.

00:18:46.306 --> 00:18:50.316 A:middle
And with iOS 9, the new Notes
application is also built

00:18:50.566 --> 00:18:51.216 A:middle
on CloudKit.

00:18:51.726 --> 00:18:54.976 A:middle
And so we've created a new web
application that sits on top

00:18:54.976 --> 00:18:57.016 A:middle
of CloudKit, and
gives all of those --

00:18:57.016 --> 00:18:59.846 A:middle
that rich capability that you
saw demonstrated at the keynote.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:00.346 --> 00:19:01.906 A:middle
So Ramiro will click in.

00:19:02.146 --> 00:19:02.846 A:middle
Here's the web app.

00:19:03.546 --> 00:19:05.706 A:middle
You're going to see some
great content in here.

00:19:05.896 --> 00:19:07.016 A:middle
You see images.

00:19:07.016 --> 00:19:08.016 A:middle
You can do videos.

00:19:08.476 --> 00:19:09.606 A:middle
There's check boxes.

00:19:10.076 --> 00:19:12.196 A:middle
All of these things are
available in the new Notes app

00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:14.986 A:middle
and they are just CloudKit
assets and records.

00:19:15.266 --> 00:19:18.846 A:middle
Okay? So what we are going to do
now is create a brand new node.

00:19:19.646 --> 00:19:21.986 A:middle
And since we are at the
developers conference,

00:19:21.986 --> 00:19:23.476 A:middle
we should probably
have a what to do

00:19:23.476 --> 00:19:25.636 A:middle
at the developers
conference while we are here.

00:19:26.456 --> 00:19:28.876 A:middle
So let's start out
with maybe one

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:31.436 A:middle
of the more important
things, which is we need

00:19:31.436 --> 00:19:33.036 A:middle
to make sure we attend
all the after parties.

00:19:33.366 --> 00:19:38.286 A:middle
Let's get that one on the list.

00:19:38.286 --> 00:19:41.716 A:middle
Now after we get done with
attending the after parties,

00:19:41.716 --> 00:19:46.586 A:middle
we really need to go to
developer.apple.com/cloudkit

00:19:47.066 --> 00:19:49.386 A:middle
and take a look at all
the amazing documentation,

00:19:49.476 --> 00:19:51.336 A:middle
including this amazing
presentation,

00:19:51.336 --> 00:19:54.156 A:middle
where you are going to be
able to find information,

00:19:54.156 --> 00:19:56.936 A:middle
documentation and everything
about CloudKit itself as well

00:19:56.936 --> 00:19:58.916 A:middle
as the new CloudKit
Web Services.

00:19:59.676 --> 00:20:02.316 A:middle
Once we get through that,
we should really go off

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.676 --> 00:20:02.316 A:middle
Once we get through that,
we should really go off

00:20:02.606 --> 00:20:05.956 A:middle
and create our first
CloudKit web application.

00:20:06.516 --> 00:20:11.346 A:middle
And once we create that, well,
we should basically move on

00:20:11.776 --> 00:20:14.206 A:middle
and do our best to try
to hit those free limits

00:20:14.326 --> 00:20:15.656 A:middle
and that might actually
take a while.

00:20:15.656 --> 00:20:17.976 A:middle
So I don't think we
will check that one off.

00:20:18.316 --> 00:20:19.966 A:middle
But I have attended
at least one party.

00:20:19.966 --> 00:20:24.256 A:middle
So I think we can check
that first one off, Ramiro.

00:20:24.776 --> 00:20:26.426 A:middle
And complete this
web experience.

00:20:26.426 --> 00:20:30.716 A:middle
Now, let's go over to
iOS, which is an iPad,

00:20:31.226 --> 00:20:33.546 A:middle
running the new Notes
application.

00:20:33.546 --> 00:20:35.106 A:middle
We will open this up.

00:20:35.506 --> 00:20:39.286 A:middle
And you will see that same
kitchen remodel project

00:20:39.286 --> 00:20:40.116 A:middle
as we saw before.

00:20:40.116 --> 00:20:42.956 A:middle
And here's our new things to
do at WWDC that we just typed.

00:20:43.436 --> 00:20:44.736 A:middle
It showed up automatically.

00:20:44.736 --> 00:20:46.086 A:middle
It's the same data, right?

00:20:46.086 --> 00:20:47.766 A:middle
It's just that we have
a web interface to it,

00:20:47.766 --> 00:20:50.536 A:middle
where you can have your
native iOS interface to it.

00:20:50.536 --> 00:20:53.786 A:middle
Now, we will make a few
more changes in here.

00:20:53.786 --> 00:20:56.576 A:middle
I have already gone to
developer.apple.com.

00:20:56.576 --> 00:20:59.976 A:middle
Ramiro you have clearly
developed an amazing CloudKit

00:20:59.976 --> 00:21:04.136 A:middle
web app with the Notes app
and why don't we now go back

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.976 --> 00:21:04.136 A:middle
web app with the Notes app
and why don't we now go back

00:21:04.136 --> 00:21:06.156 A:middle
and take a look at the web

00:21:06.646 --> 00:21:08.976 A:middle
and see what happens,
you know, over there.

00:21:09.586 --> 00:21:11.516 A:middle
Now, if all things happen,

00:21:11.516 --> 00:21:12.836 A:middle
you will notice everything
got checked.

00:21:13.066 --> 00:21:14.156 A:middle
That was, again,

00:21:14.156 --> 00:21:16.256 A:middle
that notification
experience I talked about.

00:21:16.686 --> 00:21:19.556 A:middle
The notification, push
notification happened.

00:21:20.256 --> 00:21:21.916 A:middle
The web application
picked that up,

00:21:22.256 --> 00:21:24.466 A:middle
and automatically updated itself
and showed you the changes.

00:21:25.186 --> 00:21:28.156 A:middle
And that's the new Notes
web app that's available

00:21:28.266 --> 00:21:29.916 A:middle
on iOS 9 and icloud.com.

00:21:30.486 --> 00:21:30.946 A:middle
Thanks Ramiro.

00:21:31.516 --> 00:21:41.496 A:middle
[Applause]

00:21:41.996 --> 00:21:43.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; ERIC KRUGLER: Now,
if your users are going

00:21:43.506 --> 00:21:45.156 A:middle
to use the application,
they have to sign in.

00:21:46.126 --> 00:21:48.336 A:middle
And so we are going to jump
right in to taking a look

00:21:48.336 --> 00:21:50.276 A:middle
at what that might look like
in your web application.

00:21:50.936 --> 00:21:53.396 A:middle
So, first, you need
some sort of a button

00:21:53.446 --> 00:21:54.956 A:middle
to ask the user to sign in.

00:21:55.066 --> 00:21:55.866 A:middle
This is your UI.

00:21:57.206 --> 00:22:00.806 A:middle
Now when the user clicks this,
a new browser window is going

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:57.206 --> 00:22:00.806 A:middle
Now when the user clicks this,
a new browser window is going

00:22:00.806 --> 00:22:03.366 A:middle
to pop up and this
browser window is owned

00:22:03.526 --> 00:22:04.676 A:middle
and managed by Apple.

00:22:05.236 --> 00:22:08.686 A:middle
And this is because the ID
and password is only exchanged

00:22:08.686 --> 00:22:09.836 A:middle
between the user and Apple.

00:22:09.836 --> 00:22:11.416 A:middle
The developer never sees this.

00:22:12.236 --> 00:22:14.566 A:middle
And there's a few other
things that show up further

00:22:14.566 --> 00:22:16.106 A:middle
down on the login page.

00:22:21.856 --> 00:22:23.396 A:middle
So first, there's
"Keep me signed in."

00:22:23.676 --> 00:22:26.046 A:middle
So the user can opt in to
say I want to stay signed

00:22:26.046 --> 00:22:27.076 A:middle
in for up to two weeks.

00:22:28.146 --> 00:22:29.876 A:middle
There's a "Forgot
Apple ID or password?"

00:22:29.876 --> 00:22:31.736 A:middle
So if the user has
forgotten their ID,

00:22:32.036 --> 00:22:34.536 A:middle
we'll manage the whole
flow of helping them

00:22:34.536 --> 00:22:36.866 A:middle
to remember their
password or reset it.

00:22:37.326 --> 00:22:41.206 A:middle
And finally, if the user
is brand new to, you know,

00:22:41.206 --> 00:22:43.766 A:middle
the Apple ecosystem, they
don't have an Apple ID at all,

00:22:44.096 --> 00:22:46.666 A:middle
they can create an Apple
ID right here in the flow

00:22:46.666 --> 00:22:48.296 A:middle
and they will get
an Apple account

00:22:48.466 --> 00:22:49.646 A:middle
that they can then
use immediately

00:22:49.646 --> 00:22:50.576 A:middle
with your application.

00:22:51.146 --> 00:22:57.586 A:middle
So the CloudKit Web Service
offering includes iCloud

00:22:57.586 --> 00:23:01.016 A:middle
web-only accounts what I just
described, which offers 1 gig

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:57.586 --> 00:23:01.016 A:middle
web-only accounts what I just
described, which offers 1 gig

00:23:01.326 --> 00:23:03.716 A:middle
of free storage for
private database usage.

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:07.706 A:middle
And if that same user then
goes to iOS or OS X and sets

00:23:07.706 --> 00:23:09.926 A:middle
up their account there,
it automatically upgrades

00:23:09.926 --> 00:23:12.916 A:middle
to the 5 gig iCloud
account immediately.

00:23:15.196 --> 00:23:20.816 A:middle
Public database usage is the
same for iOS, OS X and web.

00:23:20.816 --> 00:23:22.816 A:middle
There's no difference,
so a request made

00:23:22.816 --> 00:23:24.496 A:middle
on the web is the
same as a request made

00:23:24.646 --> 00:23:26.386 A:middle
on your phone or on your Mac.

00:23:26.976 --> 00:23:28.036 A:middle
Storage is the same way.

00:23:28.036 --> 00:23:32.176 A:middle
So when you go to the storage
areas or the usage information

00:23:32.216 --> 00:23:34.266 A:middle
on the Dashboard,
there's no distinction.

00:23:34.436 --> 00:23:35.296 A:middle
It's all put together.

00:23:35.856 --> 00:23:41.966 A:middle
We do require a comparable
application for iOS or OS X.

00:23:42.726 --> 00:23:45.856 A:middle
The purpose of the Web Services
is to take your amazing iOS

00:23:45.856 --> 00:23:48.406 A:middle
and OS X applications and
extend them to the web.

00:23:48.976 --> 00:23:52.926 A:middle
And it's available now in beta

00:23:52.926 --> 00:23:55.836 A:middle
for development,
releasing with iOS 9.

00:23:57.116 --> 00:24:00.296 A:middle
And that's it for
CloudKit Web Services.

00:23:57.116 --> 00:24:00.296 A:middle
And that's it for
CloudKit Web Services.

00:24:00.296 --> 00:24:03.106 A:middle
What I would like to do is
ask Olivier to come back

00:24:03.266 --> 00:24:04.486 A:middle
and close out the session.

00:24:04.486 --> 00:24:04.976 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:24:05.516 --> 00:24:11.446 A:middle
[Applause].

00:24:11.946 --> 00:24:12.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; OLIVIER BONNET: Thank
you very much, Eric.

00:24:12.946 --> 00:24:14.636 A:middle
So that's it.

00:24:15.056 --> 00:24:18.766 A:middle
We are very excited to see
what kind of application,

00:24:18.766 --> 00:24:21.196 A:middle
what kind of amazing
ideas you guys will build

00:24:21.196 --> 00:24:23.656 A:middle
on top of CloudKits.

00:24:23.926 --> 00:24:27.586 A:middle
As Eric mentioned, we have
new web page developer

00:24:27.586 --> 00:24:29.406 A:middle
at apple.com/cloudkit.

00:24:29.406 --> 00:24:33.276 A:middle
It aggregates all the data we
have and all the documentation,

00:24:33.276 --> 00:24:36.776 A:middle
the reference library, the
simple code we have on CloudKit,

00:24:36.776 --> 00:24:41.016 A:middle
both the new server, web APIs,
and the client framework.

00:24:41.866 --> 00:24:44.536 A:middle
In addition to the
usual technical support,

00:24:44.536 --> 00:24:46.886 A:middle
and forums, URLs.

00:24:47.566 --> 00:24:52.116 A:middle
If all of those fail, you
can email cloudkit@apple.com

00:24:52.116 --> 00:24:53.206 A:middle
for general inquiries.

00:24:54.566 --> 00:24:57.626 A:middle
We have two more
sessions this week.

00:24:57.906 --> 00:25:01.066 A:middle
The first one is tomorrow
and we will do a deep dive

00:24:57.906 --> 00:25:01.066 A:middle
The first one is tomorrow
and we will do a deep dive

00:25:01.066 --> 00:25:03.966 A:middle
on the CloudKit JS and
the Web Services API.

00:25:03.966 --> 00:25:09.846 A:middle
And then we have on Thursday
at 4:30, we have CloudKit Tips

00:25:09.846 --> 00:25:14.656 A:middle
and Tricks session, where
we'll do a best practices,

00:25:14.716 --> 00:25:18.076 A:middle
do's and don'ts and
as well a couple

00:25:18.306 --> 00:25:22.466 A:middle
of nice improvements we made
to the client's framework

00:25:22.466 --> 00:25:25.446 A:middle
in iOS 9, and OS X El Capitan.

00:25:26.016 --> 00:25:30.786 A:middle
We have a number of labs
during the rest of the week.

00:25:31.366 --> 00:25:33.766 A:middle
On Wednesday, Thursday,
and Friday at 9:00,

00:25:33.766 --> 00:25:35.116 A:middle
we'll have client engineers.

00:25:35.116 --> 00:25:36.356 A:middle
We will have server engineers.

00:25:36.816 --> 00:25:40.966 A:middle
I promise some of them
will even be awake at 9:00.

00:25:40.966 --> 00:25:43.796 A:middle
Please come and with your
questions, with your ideas.

00:25:43.796 --> 00:25:46.726 A:middle
We're happy to talk about
data mall, about what type

00:25:46.896 --> 00:25:49.546 A:middle
of apps you guys have in mind,

00:25:49.546 --> 00:25:51.766 A:middle
either using public
or private databases.

00:25:52.986 --> 00:25:54.036 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:25:54.096 --> 00:25:54.976 A:middle
Thank you for your attention.

00:25:55.516 --> 00:25:58.500 A:middle
[Applause]
